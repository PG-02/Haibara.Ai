    "Background": "She is an assistant inspector from Kanagawa prefecture. She is the older sister of the late Kenji Hagiwara and is also the helper of the Conan in files 1073-1075.\nOne time, she could not go to a concert with her friend, Shinobu Ooe because Jinpei Matsuda took apart her phone. They were gonna meet up at a venue and she can't find her without her phone. But, Kenji took her sister, Chihaya to the venue and called out to her friend. Her friend found her and Kenji tells Chihaya \"See, I told you, right? There is never any need to give up!\". This line was similarly quoted by Conan years later and that was the first time she finds him resembling her late brother.\n",
    "Appearance": "Chihaya has blonde and very long hair that almost reaches her waist. She has slanted blue eyes and wears pinkish-red lipstick. She is described as very pretty and looks like a 'Goddess of Wind', as quoted by Ran Mouri when she first saw Chihaya.\n",
    "Personality": "She is a kind woman as she saved Conan from falling and helped him in finding Agasa. She seems to come to trust Conan and let him come with her in 1098-1099, and sees through Conan's Sleeping Kogoro trick in 1115-1116. She also displayed a flirtatious personality towards Jugo Yokomizo and she doesn't seem to fear him. Despite this, she has shown to have an aggressive side as she used her motorcycle to hit a criminal's face to knock him out and threaten the other criminal. She is also a reckless driver, similar to Rei Furuya and her late brother, Kenji Hagiwara as shown in Wild Police Story.\n",
    "Appellations": "\n",
    "Relationships": "",
    "Jugo Yokomizo": "Both seem to have romantic feelings for each other. For example, when Jugo asked Chihaya if she wanted to go with him for dinner, she turned him down, but then reconsidered. Chihaya doesn't seem to fear him, and Jugo blushed in front of her when she flirted with him.\n",
    "Conan Edogawa": "She comes to trust Conan and took him with her. She compares Conan to her younger brother, Kenji. She would always say that if she could repay Conan's favour for reliving her brother’s remorse by disarming her brother's murderer's bomb that even Kenji and Matsuda couldn’t disarm, she would even put her life on the line.\n",
    "Kenji Hagiwara": "Kenji is her late younger brother. In files 1074-1075, she thinks Conan as her younger brother because they both won't give up.\n",
    "Jinpei Matsuda": "In file 1075, he appeared as a flashback for fixing Chihaya's broken phone. In file 1085, it is mentioned that Matsuda fell in love with her, and she calls him an idiot. In file 1087, he appeared as a flashback for stopping Shinobu's suicide attempt and saying \"Seeing the blood makes it clearer, doesn't it?\".\n",
    "Shinobu Ooe": "She is Chihaya's friend.\n",
    "Wataru Takagi": "In file 1087, Chihaya thinks of him as Matsuda for doing dangerous things, and appraises him as \"instinctively stand in the way of danger to protect what's important to you\".\n",
    "Plot overview": "",
    "Wild Police Story": "She was mentioned in the Extra Questions for Gosho Aoyama no. 8, 15 from volume 1 and 18, 19, 54 from volume 2.\n",
