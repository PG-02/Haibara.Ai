    "Background": "Jugo is the younger twin brother of Sango Yokomizo, who is also an inspector from Kanagawa police district. Both started their police career in Saitama, but some time later, Sango transferred to the Shizuoka district. However, they do stay in touch and have even assisted each other in various (and even locally unrelated) cases.\nAs children, Sango and Jugo would often play with other kids near the beach. Both brothers were actually afraid of swimming in the ocean, but while Jugo would go near the water, Sango was so scared that he would never even leave the boat.[2] Thus, Sango, even as an adult, does not know how to swim.[3]\n",
    "Personality": "Unlike his brother Sango, Jugo is serious, stern, less easygoing, and more impatient. Jugo is considered an adept inspector, but because of his habitual sinister stare, he appears even more intimidating than his brother. As a result, he is not very popular with many people outside the force, especially if they can compare him with his brother.\nIn addition, Jugo is, unlike his brother, very critical of Kogoro Mouri, whom he nicknames Smoking Kogoro (煙の小五郎 ,Kemuri no Kogorō?) because of his heavy smoking habits, instead of by his more common nickname Sleeping Kogoro (眠りの小五郎 ,Nemuri no Kogorō?). He is also not a big fan of Conan Edogawa and the Detective Boys, often yelling at them and telling them to stay away from an investigation; as a result, they believe that Sango is the nicer of the two brothers and the only one able to smile, and Haibara declares that even if they have a similar appearance, their ways of speaking and personalities are different[4]. However, when they do get through to him, Jugo always readily listens and considers their opinions. He is also quite capable in his own right, skeptical about suspects' alibis, and quick to spot obvious discrepancies in a case; he has shown to be able to resolve intricate cases while only relying on a few hints from Conan.[2]\nHe also seems to have a strong sense of moral. In a case, the murderer mocks his girlfriend about how he was only going out with her to use her as a scapegoat for his murder, Jugo hit him in the face with his elbow and told him that if he continued he might need to 'stretch' his leg (hinting that there would be more beating).[5]\nHe is also a competent officer in the heat of action, ready to threaten his own life without hesitation to protect the safety of a civilian[6].\n",
