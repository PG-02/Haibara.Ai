All five friends then graduate from the police academy at the same time.\nJinpei Matsuda was originally a member of the Tokyo Police bomb squadron. His partner Kenji Hagiwara was killed seven years ago by a serial bomber in Shinjuku[2] who had sworn revenge on the police for the accidental death of his partner. When the killer resurfaced three years ago, Matsuda's superiors, fearing that he would become reckless due to personal interest, transferred him to Megure's department, where he was promptly partnered with Miwako Sato, then a rather new detective.\nSato was at first put off by his direct manner, but then the bomber appeared in their district less than a week later, depositing an explosive charge in a Ferris wheel at an amusement park. When Matsuda attempted to disarm the bomb, the killer trapped him inside and revealed the existence of yet another bomb hidden in the city. As the countdown of the Ferris wheel bomb would wind down, the name of the second bomb's location would be gradually displayed, claiming a policeman's life for the life of innocents, as the bomber had intended. Matsuda sent the bomb location to Sato via SMS just as the final seconds ran out, his last thoughts being regret that he would not be able to drink to his partner's memory following the apprehension of the culprit.\nMatsuda's death haunted Sato for years to come, as she had fallen in love with him, and she kept his final message on her cell phone as a reminder of him.
