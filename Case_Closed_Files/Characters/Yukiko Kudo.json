    "Background": "Yukiko became internationally famous as a talented actress after having played the part of Sakamoto Ryoma's older sister Otome in a historical drama.[2]\nDespite her then-tender years as a student at Teitan High, Yukiko had a prospectively prosperous future in the film industry.[3] Thus it came as a major surprise to the world when, practically out of the blue, she married Yusaku Kudo and retired from acting.[4] She still retains good contacts in the acting and film industry, however, and has since become known as the \"Night Baroness\" (named after one of her husband's characters) after babbling out some clues provided by Yusaku on a live television show which helped solve a criminal case.[5]\nDuring her acting years, Yukiko went to a famous stage magician and disguise artist to learn the finer arts of disguise for a role she was preparing to play. There she met another actress who would become one of her closest friends, Sharon Vineyard. Until Sharon's (supposed) death, the two women stayed in touch, and Yukiko even attended her funeral, but her appearance was overshadowed by a small scandal involving Sharon's 'daughter', Chris Vineyard. Yukiko has since learned from her son about Chris/Sharon's secret life, a revelation which troubles her deeply.[6][7] She has since confronted her former friend with her knowledge, partially to know for sure, but also to save the life of Ai Haibara, who was being threatened by the Black Organization.[8]\nDespite a certain rivalry for popularity in their high school years, which had culminated in a Miss Teitan Election, Yukiko is also a close friend of Eri Kisaki, and (unlike Eri) finds her daughter Ran Mouri, a perfect match for her son.[9]\nShe is closed friends with Keiko Kurachi[10] and childhood friends with Hiromi Yabuuchi.[11]\n",
    "Personality": "Despite her adult age, Yukiko still behaves like a teenager. She is bubbly, overconfident and attention-seeking, and prefers to stand in the lime-light (literally) whenever possible. She can be prone to jealousy over Yusaku's occasionally flirtatious behavior, and can demonstrate impulsive tendencies. She is an extremely reckless driver and very sensitive about her age: whenever her son dares to call her \"oba-san\" in Japanese (in English, the closest equivalent would be \"aunt\" or \"old lady\"), she sets up such a furious face that Conan must quickly correct himself by calling her \"onee-san\" (\"older sister\" or \"young girl\"). She is also likes to stay trendy and dresses more youthfully.\nHowever, despite her faults, Yukiko is extremely loyal and cares for both her husband and her son (though a heavy streak of mischief causes her to often tease Shinichi). Her loyalty extends to her friends, as she thinks nothing of flying across the Pacific to help a friend from elementary school.[12] Even though she is retired, she takes pride in being an successful actress, to which, she is also willing to pressure Shinichi to practice his role, so he won't embarrass her reputation.[13]\n",

A very composed and creative person, she excels in making up lies on the spot with well-thought out backstories, able to constantly adapt to situations to continue the deception and likewise remember her deceptions for later usage. Very persuasive, she as a talent for reading a person's nature and adapting her nature to make them more compliment.\n",

Showing her talent since high school, Yukiko has an uncanny ability to perfectly adapt herself to whatever character she chooses. She can effortlessly change her mannerisms and speech-patterns, as well as accent and dialect, to suit the situation. Expanding upon this and learning from Toichi Kuroba, she became a master of disguise. Much like her former friend, Vermouth, with only minimum preparation required, she can perfectly change her appearance or that of others to perfectly look like virtually anyone. Her performance is able to easily fool even close friends and family. Unlike Vermouth though her skill in disguise is limited vocally, as she is unable to mimic male voices. As such, she normally takes on female personas if not of non-existent people.\n",

As a mother, she truly cares for his wellbeing (sometimes too much, much to Conan's annoyance) and assisted him when it comes to cases. Nevertheless, their relationship is quite dynamic: Yukiko enjoys teasing Shinichi/Conan; in addition, she sometimes disguises to fool him. In return, Conan often makes sarcastic remarks about Yukiko being old (obasa-san) and retired for many years, which earned him death glares and even physical blows from Yukiko.\n",
    "Friends": "20 years ago from the current timeline, she and Eri were rivals in Miss Teitan, a beauty contest that shook the country. Yukiko had a charming beauty that attracted men, while Eri had a more bookish look, relying her advantage on academic talents. The vote was split at 20000 votes for each before the competition was canceled, with Mouri Kogoro having the last uncounted ticket.\nIn later years, despite their previous intense competition, the two are actually in good terms with each other, supporting the other party emotionally. On relationships of their children, Shinichi and Ran, Yukiko shows her full support, at one point even calls Ran her future daughter in law; however, Eri is more reluctant. Eri doesn't like Yukiko's hand off approach with Shinichi and constantly reminds Ran to be beware of Shinichi, remarking on her rocky marriage as reference. After leaving Kogoro Eri hasn’t seen her friend Yukiko for 10 years up until the Eri vs. Yukiko Murder Case and after the case they went out to eat but it’s unknown if they kept in contact with each other now.\nYukiko treats Ran like her own daughter in law, and often teases her about her romantic relationship with Shinichi. She is also able to read through her thoughts; in episode 96, when Ran suspected that Conan is Shinichi. Despite that Yukiko covered for Conan telling Ran that Conan is a smart kid who learnt deductive skills from Shinichi, Yukiko found the last smile that Ran made was a bit weird, realising that the girl wasn't convinced about Yukiko's answer; which turned out to be true in the Desperate Revival arc.\nYukiko helped Shuichi Akai go into hiding after he faked his death. She taught him how to disguise himself and cooking. While faithful to and in love with her husband, she has openly commented on finding Shuichi very handsome, to which she likes visiting him every week.\nOne of Yukiko Kudo's Friend. In the past few years, the Kudo Family grew closer with their neighbor, Professor Hiroshi, who is making fancy gadgets and inventions.\nAfter Shinichi shrunk into Conan, Yukiko entrusted him the task of looking after her son for the meantime while they work overseas.\nOne of Yukiko Kudo's Friend. In High School, Yukiko and her childhood friend Eri Kisaki were involved in a \"Miss Teitan High School\" Pageant where the winner gets determined by the number of their votes. However, due to the carelessness of Kogoro, he had forgotten to vote thus tying the two contestants. It was later discovered that due to his clumsiness, Kogoro thought that the \"Miss\" meant \"Mistake\" and was going to vote for Eri as a result of that misconception, much to Eri's anger later on.\nWhen Ran questioned his father about the individual he would vote for, Kogoro, despite knowing the true nature of the pageant, still voted for Yukiko and complimented her as \"pretty\", making Eri and Ran upset and angry.\nVermouth, as her alias Sharon Vineyard and Yukiko had a friendly relationship from the time they met under Toichi Kuroba's tutelage until the time Sharon \"died\". Yukiko had no idea Sharon was leading a double life as an operative in the Black Organization. Yukiko and Sharon seemed to have kept in contact with one another because Yukiko and Sharon both knew about events in each others' lives that occurred after Toichi's lessons. Sharon was the one who got tickets for Yukiko, Shinichi, and Ran to the Golden Apple play on Broadway in New York City one year prior to the current timeline. Yukiko attended Sharon's funeral. Later, Yukiko sadly accepts Conan's deduction that Sharon and Chris are the same person and a member of the Black Organization.
