    "Background": "Wataru Takagi is a newcomer to the Tokyo Police Criminal Investigations Division 1, having transferred after the bomber case about three years ago but by the time Shinichi Kudo first established his reputation as a detective, about two years ago.[4] His mentor was a senior agent called Date, who died one year before the present timeline. In his last moments Date entrusted Takagi his notebook, which had a ring for his girlfriend Natalie Kuruma hidden. He kept Date's notebook as a personal motivation to be just as good as Date. It was first a year later he realized that Date's girlfriend was Natalie, but it was too late to give her the ring, because she committed suicide soon after Date's death. He was first introduced in an Anime original case at an on location film set.\nEver since his joining the force, Takagi (like so many of his other colleagues) has harbored romantic feelings for Miwako Sato. While Sato appeared to have taken a liking to him as well, Takagi was easily discouraged by the way she dealt with other male colleagues, including their superior Inspector Megure (though in that case it was more a daughterly affection to a father figure, since Sato's father had died when she was very young).[5][6] In time, thanks to several severe incidents - and despite the interference of the other officers in the department, chiefly Ninzaburo Shiratori -, their professional relationship grew more personal,[7][8][9][10] and finally Sato and Takagi shared their first kiss after he had been hospitalized in the course of a difficult case[11] and kissed the second (and third!) time in Episode 683 when he almost died in a bomb accident.[12]\nTakagi is among the investigators who receive the most near fatal experiences. That includes, among many things:\n- Handcuffed to the window of a burning warehouse.\n- Trapped in a tower containing a countdown bomb.\n- Held hostages and shot by the criminal.\n- Tied on a plank on a roofless two story building containing a countdown bomb, while the temperature outside is -20 Celsius degree.\nAlthough at some point, Takagi briefly develops PTSD, he nevertheless relentlessly pursues justice, even if it endangers his life.\n",
    "Personality": "While he is initially self-conscious and bumbling, Takagi is a dedicated member of the Tokyo Police Force and shows promise as a good officer as the series progresses. He is one of the few officers who trusts Conan's judgments the most, listening to him at case scenes to find important evidence and sometimes even letting Conan take the lead in their investigation (the case with Sato handcuffed to the wrong suspect in the bathroom being a good example).[13]\nTakagi has a strong intuition and sense of justice, and is very honorable. He has a strong drive to protect others, partially based in his profession as an officer, and partially based on a self-sacrificing trait in his personality. He is always very polite, even when alarmed, and defers to the judgment of his partner Miwako Sato not only because she is his senior, but because he truly respects her.\nHis hobbies are playing the maracas[14] and following the international wrestling scene, being a fan of wrestlers such as Bruiser Brody and Keiji Mutoh, and recognizing a move that Ran does as the \"Shining Wizard,\" a finishing move of Mutoh's.[15] In summary, his hobbies involve a lot of martial arts and sports.\n",

    "Actor's Apartment Case (Manga: 170-172, Anime: 102-103)": "Takagi makes his debut in the Manga series.\n",
    "Treadmill Murder Case (Manga: 208-210, Anime: 146-147)": "This is the first case to show detective Takagi’s romantic affection for a female police officer, Miwako Sato.\nInitially, Takagi is tasked with the mission of recording the Detective Boys' testimonies regarding the events at the Blue Castle. Just as they're about to begin, the children notice his untidy clothing and wonder if he doesn't have a girlfriend. Agasa offers to introduce to him his cousin's granddaughter, but Takagi awkwardly declines, stating that he has already had someone that he likes, right before detective Miwako Sato enters the room. Takagi keeps blushing, and his unnatural manner in front of Sato makes the Detective Boys think that she is really his girlfriend. However, both of them denies that this is true. Takagi wonders why Sato didn't go to assist Inspector Megure in the bank robbery case, and learns that the bank manager, together with his wife, will arrive at the Police Headquarter. Sato asks Takagi whether he has heard anything from her friend Yumi. He silently recalls Yumi's words, about what Sato told her when she was drunk, that the person she likes is someone from the first investigation division, who may very well be Takagi himself.\nThe bank manager, Keizo Masuo, comes by himself and decides to call his wife. During the phone call, Takagi and the others suddenly hear the wife's scream. He, Sato, Conan and Keizo rush to Keizo's house and find his wife's dead body. The person to be in charge of this murder case is Inspector Ninzaburo Shiratori, a police officer who has just been promoted recently. When Sato sarcastically suggests that Shiratori may as well consider her \"a possible wedding match\", Takagi misunderstands and begins to suspect that the person whom Sato said she has feelings for is none other than Shiratori. He keeps thinking of unreal scenarios with Shiratori and Sato being together, and isn't able to fully concentrate on the case.\nLater, with the help from Conan, the trick and the identity of the killer are uncovered, and the case goes to an end. After turning down the invitation of Shiratori, Sato invites Takagi to go out and have ramen for dinner, to which he accepts happily. Unexpectedly, a drunken Megure comes up and asks them to go for a drink with him at the bar, and Sato immediately approves of the idea despite the invitation to Takagi earlier. Because of this, Takagi suddenly suspects that Sato's love interest is in fact Inspector Megure, and declines the offer.\nThe case ends with a depressed Takagi lying on the table and being unable to do anything, even though he still hasn't taken the Detective Boys' testimonies yet.\n",

Megure then turns to Takagi, who starts counting in French. Agasa then corrects him, saying \"That's French,\" and then proceeds to count from one to eleven in German, solving the case.
