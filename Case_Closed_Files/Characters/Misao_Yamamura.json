    "Background": "Yamamura was born and grew up in the Gunma Prefecture. He became a police detective because he was a fan of Yukiko Kudo's television show in which she played a police woman, Dangerous Policewoman Story.[3] Yamamura, before being promoted to Inspector, was considered a rookie detective.[3] In his first case, he mentioned that the only reason why he was put on the case was because everyone else in his precinct had a cold.[3] His reputation grows after Conan knocks him out to solve a case, which gives him more assignments. Yamamura has a grandmother, named Misae Yamamura,[1] who sometimes gets indirectly involved in Yamamura's cases.[4]\nThe reaction of most characters when they see Yamamura is complete bewilderment; Kogoro even notes that he cannot believe that this is the only detective from the Gunma prefecture that can help him out during a murder case.[5] Misao also does other work in the department, including robbery cases, as well as covering traffic observations.[6] He also has escorted criminals to different places.[7]\nIn time, Yamamura was finally named an inspector, which he proudly showed off to Kogoro, Ran, and Conan. However, this annoyed Kogoro, who still called Yamamura \"Yamamura-keiji\" (Officer Yamamura) instead of \"Yamamura-\"keibu\" (Inspector Yamamura); Conan expressed worry about the future of Gunma police with Yamamura in charge of other detectives, while Ran appeared to be the only one in support of Yamamura's new promotion.[4] Later, he is revealed to work for Division 1 of the prefectural police department which covers only homicide.[8]\n",
    "Personality": "For being a detective, Yamamura makes many unnecessary mistakes, including not noticing completely obvious clues, and even feels fear at the sight of blood or a dead body. He is also incredibly naive and superstitious, fully believing that a \"curse\" was left by ghosts in a case, to the point of being scared.[9] He even messes up in trying to escort a criminal to Nakanojō forest, deserting his own post because he wanted to buy himself some lunch.[7] He also does not act in good conduct, publicly fawning over Yukiko Kudo when he found out who she was.[3] Misao also once got heavily distracted by a portable television that he brought during a case because he had wanted to watch a romantic drama that was airing at the time of an investigation.[10] And when it comes to Gunma, Misao doesn't even fully know the whole area, and has to be corrected by locals on certain things.[11]\nHowever, even though he is a little clueless, Yamamura still knows the basics of his work and what to do in a crisis. For instance, he often writes in his notebook every piece of information he has been given about the case - even if that does not prevent him from forgetting what he has written,[12] He is also very supportive, and always wants to lend a helping hand in solving a case. He is not completely lost during murder cases, figuring it out when Conan has to resort to giving out hand signs to him due to losing his voice from a cold.[5] Also, Misao is very handy in helping catch a criminal, having been used by Conan to help confront a criminal that was trying to proclaim their innocence.[13] He also helped catch another criminal, mostly through instructions Conan, pretending to be Kogoro, left for him on his cell phone as a text message.[9] He even tried giving Kogoro credit for the case, showing that unlike Kogoro, he can be modest.[9] However, Conan indicated in the text message that \"Kogoro\" wanted Misao to take all of the credit.[9]\nWhenever Yamamura is involved in catching a criminal, he tends to become very excited. He noted that it felt like a \"movie\" when he had to shoot one of the runaway robbers in a bank robbery case.[6] He is extremely excited to be involved in helping Eri Kisaki and Conan catch the real killer in another case to the point of acting like a little kid after the killer was arrested, talking about how he acted and looked when confronting the killer.[13] His child-like reactions also manifest on the opposite end of the spectrum. One time when Yamamura decides that he is a bad police officer after making two big blunders during one case, it became up to Conan, Haibara, and the Detective Boys do their best to cheer him up so that he could feel better and lend them a hand in finding Mitsuhiko.[7] Still, he is quite conscious of the importance of his role in society and his profession, making him in morale - if not in skill - a true police officer.[7]\n",

    "The Raven Chaser (Movie: 13)": "One of the murders of the case having happened on the Gunma border, Misao is called onto the investigation.

Misao is one of the few inspectors (with Sango) to follow Kogoro's whimsical theory about the murder, and he is eventually the only one to come with him when he leaves the headquarters on his own, saying he is going to catch the culprit. He still plays a role in the movie, by hearing Vermouth dialing her Boss' phone number; the tune unconsciously makes him whistle the Nanatsu no Ko song, leading Conan to suspect that a member of the Organization infiltrated the meeting.\n",

After the sunset, Conan used Agasa to solve the case instead of Yamamura and, seeing the culprit, Yamamura exclaims himself that the culprit must show remorse and atone for his crimes which stuns the forensics officer and Conan before making a thumbs up since the case is solved. The Detective Boys approve his statement and make also a thumbs up except for Haibara who just stares at him. He then laughs out just like Kogoro.\n",
    "Rube Goldberg Machine (Anime: 1111-1112)": "While Yamamura is investigating a murder case within a villa resort, he meets Kogoro, Ran, and Conan, who also happen to be nearby. According to Conan's deduction, the victim in this murder case is murdered by a convoluted mechanical gimmick that undergoes several complicated movements and eventually combine to contribute to carry out a simple intent - in this case, murdering. This type of machine is generally being called \"Rube Goldberg Machine\". The victim is apparently the CEO and founder of a well-known restaurant \"Cheom Cheom\", which specialises in making Yangnyeom chicken. After some brief investigations, Yamamura finds out that the suspects with regards to this case seem to be somewhat intricate; therefore, Yamamura and the Mouri family start to fumble the case further. They then encounter numerous incidents that happened, related to the case, but just like a Rube Goldberg Machine, acting as each piece of device that makes up a Rube Goldberg Machine, propagating by every element...\nAfter some indescribable efforts they etch, Conan figures out the truth to all of these Rube Goldberg Machine-like murder cases, and Inspector Yamamura gatheres all of the suspects at the police station. Due to the fact that Conan was originally using Shinichi Kudo's name to grant some findings to Yamamura, this made Yamamura think that Shinichi was in fact working alongside with him. Just as he explains the situation, he mentions about Shinichi: \"Great detective Kogoro Mouri is here... but,\" says Yamamura. \"the greater detective Kudo...\" Conan then perceives that by letting Yamamura finishing this sentence, it might shatter Kogoro's vanity, and also make Ran feel confused. So right in time, Conan tranquillizes him and takes over this awkward speech, \"Kudo Shinichi won't be solving this case either.\" Conan solves the case superbly with Yamamura fully asleep.\nAfter all of that, Yamamura gained popularity, and the case got rather famous. He was interviewed and his speech was braodcast on the TV. In that programme, Yamamura claims that \"their daily efforts that turned luck their way in the first place\".\n",

    "Relationships analysis": "",
    "Kogoro Mouri": "Misao met Kogoro from the case. He is a very big fan of him, to the point of fawning over him, acting as if he was Mouri's biggest fan, and often being the only one to approve and follow his more bizarre deductions. He considers that they are partners and that, when on a case together, they have a 100% chance to catch the criminal; however, Kogoro does not approve of the \"partner\" appellation.[16] Misao is very disappointed when he cannot film Kogoro during his \"sleeping\" form, musing that he wanted to show the other detectives at the Gunma Police Department.[17] However, when he finally does get to film Kogoro's sleeping deduction, he leaves the camera on pause during the whole deduction, showing off his carelessness.[16] He even cries heavily when he thinks that Kogoro has killed himself, not knowing that it was merely an imposter that looked like him.[17] However, this does not mean that Kogoro doesn't fall victim to Misao's bad deductions; the first time that Misao meets him, he announces that Kogoro is the killer without barely any evidence at all.[13] Although Kogoro does not like his detective skills, he considers Yamamura a friend on a purely personal level, especially when both detectives drink together.[17]\n",
