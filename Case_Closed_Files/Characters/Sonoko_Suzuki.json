    "Background": "Sonoko Suzuki is the second daughter of Shiro Suzuki, head of the extremely wealthy family and large company, second only to Renya Karasuma[2], and his wife Tomoko. She has an older sister, Ayako, and an uncle, Jirokichi, who is often involved in trying to capture Kaitou Kid. She and Ran have been close friends since kindergarten.\n",
    "Personality": "Sonoko's primary character traits are her impulsiveness, her temper and sense for romanticism. She often acts without thinking ahead, thereby usually dragging Ran (and by extension, Conan) into her schemes[3] or firing her mouth away with wild tales.[4] Often she acts very insensitively to other's feelings; while she encourages Ran to take her relationship with Shinichi to a higher level, she just as much enjoys teasing her best friend and beholding her embarrassment.[5][6][7][4] Despite coming from a very wealthy family and fully enjoying such a pampered lifestyle, Sonoko is surprisingly humble about it. Never trying to buy popularity and friends or bribe her way to get what she wants, Sonoko appreciates getting things that matter and for the right reasons.\nAt the series' start, Sonoko's primary interest was in boys and in trying to snag the \"perfect boy\". She often tried multiple avenues to attract a boyfriend, including dressing up specifically to attract a boy, making a boy chocolates,[8] trying to impress a boy while wearing a bikini,[9] or going to various events that young guys were going to attend.[10] Whenever Ran's company diverts the attention of Sonoko's target, Sonoko feels jealous and disappointed (although this has never affected their friendship).[11] However, this changed when Sonoko met and began dating Makoto. Although Sonoko is still easily attracted to other men,[12] she is loyal to Makoto and tries to act the way she thinks a girlfriend should, including making him gifts[13] and planning romantic rendezvous.[3]\nSonoko loves to go on big vacations, like expensive ski trips,[10] and loves to buy fancy clothes and items.[14] She is also a big fan of the band LEX,[15] and various other people in pop music, including Two-Mix.[16]\nConan has had to use Sonoko sometimes when he needs to do a deduction show. At first he struggled to mimic Sonoko's mannerisms and feminine speech patterns, but now he is better at it.[17] However, because he has had to use Sonoko so often for a deduction, she, like Kogoro Mouri, has completely bought into her whole \"sleeping\" person, calling herself the best detective in Teitan High School, and a \"Deduction Queen.\"[17] This makes Conan sometimes regret using her to solve a case, though he does admire her courage in certain situations. Sonoko is sometimes able to solve little things on her own, and can figure things out when she is provided some assistance by Conan, such as when Conan was sick and had to communicate to Sonoko, Kogoro, and Yamamura in charades and sign language.[18]\nLike many other people, Sonoko is a big fan of the Kaitou Kid, due to his style, charm and daring exploits. She keeps cheering him on in trying to steal something, even when that 'something' is a rare treasure of the Suzuki family. She wishes to meet Kid up close (and have it develop into something more), and sometimes almost gets her wish, but is very disappointed at the ultimate failure.[19]\nIn non canon she also loves to go to festivals where sugary sweets are on display, often picking up gigantic plates filled with various cakes.[20][21]She has even used Conan for the sole purpose of having a children's discount on food.[22]\nShe also speaks too politely and formally toward some people for example she refers her uncle as Oji-sama rather than Oji-san also he calls Kogoro same and Eri as Oba-sama,she also calls the guests Okyaku-sama,but she calls her father and mother Papa and Mama,and her sister aneiki.\nDespite her brave personality like normal girls she screams at sight of a deadbody.\n",
    "Appellations": "\n",
    "Appearance": "When not in the Teitan High School uniform, Sonoko often wears a bandanna holding back her fringe, a skirt, and a cute shirt. Her clothes often show more skin compared to Ran, mostly for the purpose of attracting guys. In Countdown to Heaven, she temporarily changes her hairstyle to a perm.\n",
    "Plot overview": "",
    "Deduction Queen Sonoko (Manga: 40-44, Anime: 34-35)": "Conan and Ran visit Sonoko's mountain villa to see the autumn leaves and meet up with some old friends. On the way to the front they see a strange bandaged man in a dark cloak crossing the bridge. When they see him turn around, they are shocked at his face, as he quickly makes a retreat around the side of the house. Everything seems fine as Ran tries to find her room, accidentally walking in on the men also staying the house. When everyone is asked about the bandaged man he is brushed off as possibly a crazy man with nothing better to do. However, he is taken far more seriously when Ran is attacked in the woods, but the attacker is scared off by Conan, and later one of the women is seen being carried off by him from the windows. Conan and the other men chase him and find her dismembered body in the woods.\nEveryone decides that it is best to go to bed for the night, when he strikes again, this time trying to kill Ran in her sleep. Conan saves Ran by waking her up to defend herself, but when the bandaged man retreats Conan wonders why Ran is a target. Everyone decides to stay up for the night and keep together to throw off the murderous man. Conan suspects that Ran saw something that made her a target, and the culprit is one of the people staying there. Despite having solved the case, Conan cannot present the solution, since his usual mouthpiece Kogoro isn't there to be put to sleep. So, he decides to solve the case through Ran. When he shoots the anaesthetic needle, however, Sonoko ends up in the way and she falls asleep. Left with no choice, Conan reveals the killer via Sonoko. While Sonoko doesn't remember making the deductions, she is very proud at having \"solved\" the case.\n",
    "An Important Date (Manga: 105-107, Anime: 32)": "At the end of the case, Conan asks the person that she was meeting is Shiro Wakaoji, a young man (and a client of the coffee shop where the murder took place) plans to take advantage of a \"naive\" teenage girl he met while skiing, despite his already having a girlfriend. She says no, but Shiro tries to flirt with her just before Sonoko announces her presence — Sonoko is his intended date. Conan, knowing that Wakaoji only wants to toy with Sonoko, repeats what Wakaoji said in the coffee shop, pretending that he does not understand it and needs explanation. Sonoko hears Conan's revelations about Wakaoji's true intentions, slaps Wakaoji and storms away.\n",
    "Makoto's Introduction (Manga: 219-221, Anime: 153-154)": "Sonoko, Ran and Conan go to Izu (a popular holiday destination in Shizuoka Prefecture known for its beautiful beaches) and Sonoko wishes to find a boyfriend there. At the beach, Sonoko takes a picture of Ran fixing her bathing suit and jokes about sending the picture to Shinichi (since she likes teasing Ran and Shinichi about being an \"old married couple\"). Sonoko also laments about her lack of a love life, but immediately after, a college student called Tadahiko Michiwaki, asks her out to lunch. Ecstatic at the romantic attention, she agrees to lunch and then to dinner as well. However, due to nervousness, she asks Ran and Conan come along. During the meal, Michiwaki tells Sonoko and company that young brunette girls (like her) have been found murdered in the woods not far from the restaurant, once a year ago and once much more recently, but he offers to keep Sonoko safe.\nThe night arrives. When Sonoko enters her hotel room, she sees a suspicious figure searching her belongings. The figure attacks her, and she bites that person in self-defence before he escapes. The stoic and somewhat unfriendly high school student, Makoto Kyogoku, who is working at the ryokan moves the group to another room. Ran thinks she has seen him somewhere before but cannot remember where. Michiwaki arrives muddy and wet and Conan suspects him of attacking Sonoko, but he does not have a bite mark on his arm. Makoto has a bandaged bicep and falls under suspicion but Sonoko says he wasn't the attacker because the attacker was hairy. Michiwaki, Sonoko, Ran, and Conan decide to have dinner at the ryokan because Michiwaki says that his car has broken down. Conan speculates that Sonoko's attacker was looking for the photographs she was taking during the trip, but cannot figure out why. Conan does not think there are any incriminating photos, but perhaps the murderer overheard Sonoko talking about the photographs (about sending them to Shinichi) and misunderstood.\nThe next day, Michiwaki, Ran and Conan go to eat at a restaurant while Sonoko tries to have a light sleep in the car. Suddenly, the car starts rolling towards the nearby cliff edge, and Sonoko barely escapes with her life. However, there is no evidence pointing towards the culprit. Ran and Conan go to report the incident while Michiwaki keeps Sonoko company. When alone on a walk in the forest, Michiwaki reveals that he is the serial killer and Sonoko is his target. He had the mistaken notion that Sonoko took a picture of him with his lastest victim and wants to get rid of both the picture and Sonoko a witness. Before he can hurt her, Makoto appears and saves her with an impressive martial arts display. Ran realizes that Makoto is a martial arts champion she has seen in competitions before. Makoto confesses awkwardly that he loves Sonoko, to Sonoko's surprise and delight. Though Makoto is often travelling for tournaments, he and Sonoko maintain a long-distance relationship.\n",
    "Jodie's Introduction (Manga: 271-273, Anime: 226-227)": "Sonoko, Ran, and Conan are at the arcade taking sticker photos, which Ran realizes Sonoko suggested because Sonoko wants to put a sticker with her face on a letter to Makoto. Sonoko blushes but doesn't deny it. Soon after, they encounter their High School English teacher, Jodie Saintemillion, who is an avid gamer. Jodie introduces Ran to a virtual reality fighting game which uses mechanics to simulate a real fight. Ran loses to a gamer named Kengo Bito who taunts her for losing before going on to fight against his rival, Takayasu Shimizu. The battle is projected on a large screen, showing Bito's avatar overwhelming Shimizu's until just before the final blow. At the strange behavior, spectators check on Bito and discover that he is dead.\nThe police investigate and after reviewing the security camera's footage, they limit the suspects down to four people. When Conan deduces the culprit, he uses Sonoko again as he mouthpiece to expose the murderer. On the way home, Jodie says that Sonoko was like Kate Martin, and Ran says Sonoko was just like Shinichi. Ran and Sonoko part with Jodie on good terms.\n",
    "Girl Clubbing Case (Manga: 284-286, Anime: 217-218)": "Ran and Sonoko shop for a sweater that Sonoko wants to buy for Makoto; Ran scold Sonoko when she realizes Sonoko wants to pass the sweater off as hand-knitted by her. Ran sends Sonoko ahead to join Kogoro and Conan at a pasta shop, where they had coincidentally encountered the police investigating serial attacks on Japanese women following the \"ganguro\" fashion with darkly tanned skin, bleached hair, turtlenecks, miniskirts and high platform boots. Ran gets turned around and ends up in the parking lot, where she discovers a fourth victim, dead.\nDuring the investigation, Sonoko and Ran point out that the victims are wearing a jacket that wasn't theirs, and Conan realizes the victims were attacked just after leaving somewhere warm—their cars. Sonoko leaves to put her shopping in the car and then use the toilet, attracting the attention of someone in the crowd. It turns out the culprit blames the victim wearing platform shoes while driving on the death of his son, and he is attacking any woman who drives with platform shoes. Sonoko is wearing platform shoes, and when she leaves the department store toilet the culprit is waiting to attack her. Sonoko screams and runs away, but manages to knock off the hat and scarf hiding his face, leaving him determined to kill her so she can't identify him. As Sonoko runs, her ankle twists under her and she falls. When the murderer attacks her, however, Inspector Megure arrives in the nick of time to protect her and confront the culprit. Megure was injured while protecting Sonoko, and at the hospital, Superintendent Matsumoto tells Ran and Sonoko the story of a girl Megure knew who impersonated a serial killer's victims and was gravely injured. Sonoko and Ran are moved to tears, thinking that the girl died, but it turns out that she survived and is now Megure's wife.\n",
    "Murderous Pottery Class (Manga: 305-307, Anime: 228-229)": "Sonoko shows off to Ran what she made in pottery class: a small cup for herself with Makoto's name on it and a large cup for Makoto with her name on it. Sonoko believe that doing this will have Makoto think of her every time he drinks from it, and in this way he will not forget her and fall in love with another girl. She invites Ran to join the pottery class as well, and Ran thinks of Shinichi and accepts. As Ran works on her project, Sonoko tries to take a sneak peek of what Ran is writing on the cup, but Ran does not let her, and after Sonoko ignores her warnings repeatedly Ran threatens to end their friendship if she ever catches Sonoko in the act. A murder then happens and Conan tranquillizes Sonoko to reveal the truth.\nA few days later, Sonoko shows Ran a picture that Makoto has sent her; to her embarrassment, Makoto mistook her cup for a flower pot, and the picture depicts the cup with flowers planted in it.\n",
    "Bloody Valentine (Manga: 331-334, Anime: 266-268)": "",
    "Halloween Party (Manga: 429-434, Anime: 345)": "Kogoro Mouri receives an invitation to a Halloween cruise; the Halloween cruise is famous for hiring guests to star in a horror film. Sonoko lends her makeup skills to turn Kogoro into a vampire. Because Ran hates horror-themed things, Sonoko ends up going to party as Kogoro's guest, dressed as a witch. During the cruise, the party members are divided into groups; team \"Devil\" consists of Kogoro, Sonoko, and people disguised as a werewolf, a mummy, a medusa and an invisible man. During the party, the host is murdered by a crossbow arrow with a card identifying team devil attached. Sonoko investigates with Kogoro and both suspect the mummy, who has no card, but later it is revealed to have been a trick.

They are soon overwhelmed, and Sonoko desperately shouts for Makoto's help, and he actually comes shortly after (although he is supposed to be abroad and competing in an important karate tournament) and saves her from harm. After solving the case, on their way home, Makoto says that he was preparing for the tournament, but came back to Japan without hesitation after understanding the allusion of Sonoko's message to the TV series. However, since he was not able to figure out when the rendezvous was supposed to be, he set up a tent in the forest and planned to wait until Sonoko appears.

Sonoko makes a bet with Kaitou Kid the night before his heist to test whether Makoto can distinguish between her and the Kid-impersonated Sonoko, and she makes him promise to not hurt Makoto, as he has an upcoming tournament. Makoto eventually passes the test and is able to guard the diamond. Sonoko is initially delighted, but becomes slightly disappointed when Makoto admits that he noticed that Sonoko was being impersonated by Kid only because the impostor's ring fingers were longer than the index fingers, and in Sonoko the opposite is true.\n",

    "Relationships analysis": "",
    "Family and friends": "Sonoko and Ran have been best friends ever since they were little.[35] Sonoko is often there to help Ran whenever she is bullied by other school children, more often there than even Shinichi was.[35][36]They were often shown hanging out with each others on the way home after school. Sonoko usually invites Ran to join her on trips, family events (such as Jirokichi's Kid heists), other trips or activities[37], or simply just go shopping together. Sonoko once said to a murderer what she thought about friendship: \"So what if friendship is unreliable and fragile! That way when you communicate with your heart, you can feel the warmth inside. If it were as hard as some chattering iron plate, you wouldn’t feel the warmth, y’know?\"[38]\nMeanwhile, even though Ran knows that Sonoko has a lot of money, she always makes sure that money never gets involved in their friendship. Ran once chose to not go on a ski vacation with Sonoko because she didn't have the money to pay for her own trip, when she knew that Sonoko would pay for her to go if asked.[39] This, along with other things, has helped strengthen the bond between both Ran and Sonoko.\nDespite teasing Ran about her feelings for Shinichi, it also seems that Sonoko, at some point, wants Ran to respond to Shinichi's confession and at least try helping her on that matter.\nBefore meeting the man of her own, Sonoko was sometimes envious that Ran always got the attentions from boys.[40] However, this didn't affect the deep friendship between them.\nSonoko Suzuki and Shinichi are childhood friends. They know each other since childhood. Sonoko finds Shinichi's mystery affection annoying and considers him as arrogant and showoff but acknowledge his knowledge and intelligence deeply. On the other hand Shinichi finds Sonoko annoying as she constantly teases Ran and him about their relationship, calling them Husband and Wife, or Boyfriend and Girlfriend. Shinichi also finds Sonoko's attempts of attracting boys rather irritating. Sonoko is one of only few people who calls Shinichi by his first name with the honorific '-kun'. Shinichi, in turns, also calls Sonoko by her first name, but without including any honorific.\nIn Conan Edogawa form, whenever Shinichi/ Conan is near Sonoko, she gets annoyed. She thinks of him as a brat who knows a lot of weird stuff. Conan finds her annoying in turn, especially when she teases Ran about her relationship with Shinichi.\nSonoko originally met Makoto Kyogoku while on a vacation, when he worked at his father's hotel in his spare time.[41] At first, neither she, Conan, nor Ran recognized him, because he wore glasses to hide his features. He later saves her when he takes a knife in the arm for her, to protect her from getting killed by a crazed serial killer.[41] This is when Ran finally realizes that he is the famous karate champion. After defeating the killer, he confesses his feelings for her, which leaves Sonoko dumbfounded and flustered.[41] According to Makoto, he originally met Sonoko during one of Ran's tournaments, and loved how feisty and fiery she was in trying to cheer her friend on.[41] After this, Sonoko and Makoto begin a long distance relationship.[41]\nMakoto often saves Sonoko from dangerous peril, like in a snow lodge,[42] and in a forest.[3] Sonoko loves to plot romantic rendezvous with Makoto,[3]; he tries to go along, though things don't always go the way Sonoko imagines they will.[42][3] He often warns her against dressing to revealingly, afraid she'll attract predatory men as a result.[41][42]\nSonoko often wants to show Makoto that her feelings for him are stronger than he thinks, planning simple ideas to make him feel special. However, these often go in awry, as she either cannot make what she had planned to make, like when she promised to make him a home-made sweater, but had to resort to buying one in a mall,[14] or Makoto has no idea what she gave him is, like when he believed that the pottery she sent him was supposed to be for flowers.[13] Sonoko keeps a photo of Makoto in her purse, and uses it as a good luck charm for when she takes exams.[43] She has also made him Valentine's chocolate, trying to make him feel jealous by not saying who it was for, thus forcing him to visit her in a snow lodge to ask her what was going on.[42] When he finds out that indeed, she made him the chocolate, he gets very embarrassed himself.[42]\nAlthough long distance relationships can be hard to be in, Sonoko has stayed faithful to Makoto, other than dreaming of meeting up with the Kaitou Kid, though this is mostly to see him up close more than anything else.\nWhile having a conversation with Ran and Kazuha, Sonoko once jokingly stated that she was interested in Heiji.[44]\nSonoko and Kazuha have met each other only a few times in the anime. Despite this, they have a friendly relationship. In movie 10, Sonoko seemed to be pleased after seeing Kazuha at the Wonder Land, she even offered her to come with her and Ran.\nSonoko and Ran are good friends with Masumi, and they are often seen returning home together after school. Sonoko has a habit of teasing Masumi about her \"flat chest\". However, she does acknowledge Masumi's popularity in school due to her deductive abilities and her prowess in martial arts.\n",
    "Others": "Sonoko thinks that Kaitou Kid is a really cool guy because of his quick and versatile actions when he is doing his thievery. She is also very much charmed by him, often daydreaming of how he will fight for her affections or fall hopelessly in love with her. This occasionally brings trouble because of Sonoko's infatuation with Kaitou Kid, most notably the time where her boyfriend Makoto thought he had to fight Kaitou Kid for her heart. In the end, Sonoko, although she flirts with Kid and often tries to catch his attention, is actually committed to her relationship with Makoto. This is even attested by Kaitou Kid, who told Makoto that he couldn't capture her heart because it belongs to Makoto.\n",
    "Character popularity": "eBookJapan held a character popularity poll from April 12, 2011 to May 12, 2011 in which readers of Detective Conan (international included) could vote for their favorite character. Sonoko placed 7th in the poll with 86 votes out of the 5,883 that were cast.[45]\n",
    "Name origin": "Her name, Sonoko Suzuki (鈴木園子), comes from Sonoko Suzuki(鈴木その子), a famous Japanese businesswoman[citation needed]. \"鈴\" (suzu) means \"bell\" and \"木\" (ki) refers to either \"wood\" or \"tree\".\n",
    "Different looks": "",
    "Quotes": "— Sonoko to Shodo.[38]\n",
    "Trivia": "- According to Detective Conan producer Michihiko Suwa, Sonoko was supposed to appear only once in the anime, but since the staff liked Sonoko's voice actor's portrayal so much, they made her appear more.\n- According to Suwa, Momiji Ooka was made to be the \"Sonoko of the West\".\n- Sonoko has been shown to be very aggressive. For example when Genta called her \"Auntie Sonoko\", she punched him extremely hard, and when she was interrupted by a soccer ball, she threw it back at the kicker, causing him to fall back.\n- The first Latin American Spanish dub (until Episode 123) was very inconsistent regarding Sonoko's name. She was usually called Sarita, but she has also been called Susana, Anabela, Sonia and others. The new dub retains the original names, so the inconsistency is now gone.\n- \"Sonoko\" (園子) is written with the characters for \"garden\" and \"child\".\n- Sonoko's cellphone strap used to be a small figurine of her boyfriend Makoto in karate outfit.\n- Unknown to her, Masumi, Ran, and Sonoko are in the Teitan High Secret Popularity Contest Top Ten.\n"
