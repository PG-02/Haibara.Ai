  "sections": {
    "Background": "Vodka is a member of the Black Organization who is often seen by Gin's side. His official position is that of secretary in the general oversight division[2], so he handles most of the research and information for the duo, such as setting up meetings (309-311), and relaying information to other members (54, 345). Vodka is often seen using some transport.\n",
    "Appearance": "Vodka has a muscular body, a wide chin making him look more like a member of the mafia, yakuza or simply a thug. Vodka wears a black fedora with a red stripe around it, also he wears black clothes but his shirt is red. Vodka is mostly seen wearing black glasses.\n",
    "Personality": "Vodka speaks and acts like a typical mafia or Yakuza type gangster, and he is just as ruthless a killer as his partner Gin. However, he is also more easy-going and trusting than the latter, thus making him more susceptible to traps Conan sets to apprehend the Organization. In addition, he tends to not perform well under stress without guidance from Gin or other characters, as exemplified in Reunion with the Black Organization when, distracted by Gin being sedated, he fails to realize Shiho is escaping and stop her before it is too late.\nWhile his astuteness is largely overshadowed by Gin, Vodka can notice details that Gin does not, sometimes to the point of endangering Conan. An example of this would again be in Sherry’s Return, where Vodka noted Haibara’s partially consumed bottle of paikaru and the unfolded laptop containing data about APTX 4869. (She had left these behind in order to be able to climb through the chimney and successfully escape from the room before the two arrived).\nOn the bullet train's dining car,[3] Vodka spotted a piece of gum that Conan had previously planted; however, Vodka then confirmed it was just a piece of gum, apparently unaware of the tracker hidden inside.\nAnother example occurred while Vodka was on the phone with Conan, who at the time was impersonating the Organization contact Suguru Itakura with his voice changing bowtie. During the conversation, Vodka heard the click of Agasa turning on the lights in the background, although Conan again alleviates his suspicions by telling him that the sound was just the wind blowing.\n",
    "Abilities": "",
    "Marksmanship": "Vodka is a fairly accurate shot with handguns. In Reunion with the Black Organization he pretty accurately shoots at adult height where Conan is standing behind the door. Note that in the anime, Vodka is depicted as shooting wildly because the animators mistook the drawings of the muzzle flash for wall impacts.\n",
    "Memory": "Vodka apparently has a good memory. He could recall offhand the conditions, reasons, and circumstances of the Shinichi's death quite some time after the fact when Gin asked.\n",
    "Appellations": "\n",
    "Plot overview": "Vodka was the first Black Organization member introduced to the series.\n",
    "Blackmail Transaction with a Company Owner (Manga: 1, Anime: 1)": "Gin and Vodka blackmailed an unnamed company owner who had been smuggling guns for over 100 million yen in cash. After Vodka received the briefcase of cash, he returned the film evidence of the business' gun smuggling. Vodka may have intended to kill the man when the transaction was complete as he began to draw his gun, but it could also have been in response to the company owner's remark the Black Organization does even worse things than gun smuggling. The man escaped when Gin assaulted Shinichi who had been spying on the transaction and Vodka was distracted.\n",
    "Murder of Akemi Miyano (Manga: 16, Anime: 128)": "In order to free both her sister and herself from the Black Organization, Akemi Miyano accepts the mission to rob one billion yen from a bank. To increase the chances of her sucess, she hires a driver and a giant-like man as assistants. However, the driver, Kenzo Hirota, disappears with the cash after the robbery, forcing Akemi to search for him. She hires Kogoro under the alias \"Masami Hirota\", supposedly Kenzo's teenage daughter. Kogoro luckily manages to find Kenzo for Akemi; after she is left alone with Kenzo, she and their third partner kill Kenzo and stage his death as a suicide hanging after taking the money. Meanwhile, Gin and Vodka meets Masami, who call her Akemi Miyano. Gin asks where the money is. Akemi refuses to reveal the location without them giving up her sister, since she'd done the job on the condition that the two of them could leave after. Gin answers that her sister, as a \"top brain\" in the organization, is too indispensable to have ever considered giving up. Akemi refuses Gin offer of one last chance to reveal the money cache.\n",
    "Bullet Train Case (Manga: 33)": "Gin and Vodka board a bullet train to complete a transaction: selling information about gold for 400 million yen. They arrange the meeting place to be a dining car on the second floor of the bullet train. On the way to their seats, Gin and Vodka coincidentally encounter Conan. However, neither of them recognize that he is actually Shinichi Kudo, because they are unaware of the rare shrinking effect of APTX 4869. Vodka simply orders Conan to get out of the way and they take their seats, which are very near the Mouris', without paying further attention to him. When Gin and Vodka go to make the transaction, Conan plants an eavesdropping bug in the seat ashtray. Once they return, he overhears them discussing how the black briefcase they exchanged for 400 million yen has no information about gold, but is a bomb their client is sure to set off without meaning to at a specific time. Conan also learns their codenames at this time. They leave the train at Nagoya station, before the explosion is set to occur when the client dials a specific phone number as instructed to learn how to open the case; the number is actually the bomb activator. It is unknown if Gin, Vodka, or the Organization know that Conan was the one who found the bomb and kicked it off the train just before it exploded.\n",
    "Game Company Murder Case (Manga: 114-116, Anime: 54)": "At the Mantendo Convention, Conan encounters the man code-named Tequila. Tequila appears at the Mantendo Corporation convention to buy a list of the best programmers in the world from one of the company employees, Hideaki Nakajima. The exchange occurs by the two men bumping into each other in the hallway and exchanging claim tickets for the convention hall's coat-check area. Tequila uses the claim ticket to obtain Hideaki's company briefcase; however, both men are unaware that Hideaki's ticket was previously switched with that of his co-worker with the intention of killing him via a briefcase-bomb. When Tequila opens the briefcase, the explosion kills him.\nMeanwhile, Conan sees Tequila again on their way back, trading tag 98 for a Mantendo-employee briefcase. Conan is curious, but decides it's not his problem until he overhears the man start a phone-call with Vodka by identifying himself as Tequila and ask Vodka to tell Gin that he promise to meet both of them later.\nTequila and Vodka speak over the phone, though Vodka's dialogue is never heard in the episode, and we're left to interpret it through Tequila's responses. Tequila is easily frustrated talking to Vodka, though it may just be from Conan distracting Tequila for a few seconds. Neither Gin or Vodka appear in the episode aside from some background shots, and Vodka doesn't have lines.\n",
    "The University Professor Murder Case (Manga: 179-180 and 181, Anime: 129)": "Masami Hirota, age 61, was a Nanyo University professor. Akemi Miyano had contact with and was probably close to him because she borrowed his name when coming up with an alias. Shiho mistakenly sent him an APTX 4869 disk when it was mixed up for a disk of Akemi's pictures Shiho was sending back via the professor's address. The Black Organization intended to kill Masami Hirota, but he was killed by an unrelated person first. Vodka disguised his voice and left a message on his answering machine pretending to be from \"Kuro Life Insurance\" so he could try to set up a meeting.\n",
    "Reunion with the Black Organization (Manga: 238-242, Anime: 176-178)": "Gin and Vodka are planning to eliminate someone, and already has a member named Pisco in Haido City Hotel. Pisco recognizes Haibara's childhood form and on Gin's order, kidnaps her from the wake after he murders the target. Then Gin and Vodka are on their way to the hotel and intercept her, in Shiho's form, on the roof. Gin shoots her several times as torture to make her answer how she escaped the gas chamber. When she refuses, Gin is about to kill her when Conan shoots Gin with the tranquilizer needle and orders Shiho via th voice-changing bowtie to escape back down the chimney. Gin shoots himself in the arm to stay awake, while Vodka tries unsuccessfully to shoot Conan, letting Shiho escape successfully just before she reverts to Haibara.\nIn the chimney, Haibara meet Kenzo Masuyama who is revealed to be Pisco. When he is just about to shoot Haibara, Conan reveals himself to Pisco. Ethanol fumes are set alight by Pisco's cigarette and the whole cellar catches fire. Conan and Haibara escape in the confusion. Pisco hears someone getting down the chimney. He thought that it was Conan and Haibara, but it was actually Gin who had survived from Conan's tranquilizer darts. He then tells Pisco that he was photographed when commiting the crime, and then shoots him, resulting in his death.\n",
    "Vodka's rendezvous with Suguru Itakura (Manga: 380-382 and 381, Anime: 309-311)": "Ran tells Conan that Shuichi is an FBI agent causing Conan to wonder what the FBI are doing in Japan. Conan heads to Agasa to analyze the data from Itakura's disk and learn that the Black Organization were going to Itakura's cottage to retrieve the program he was working on. Conan and Agasa head to Itakura's cottage in an attempt to intercept the email the email the Black Organization would send in order to trace them. However, the email was programmed to be deleted if the correct password was not typed and subsequently causes the Black Organization members to believe Itakura is in the cottage. Vodka phones the house and believing Itakura is in the cottage, to pick up the phone.\nOnce arriving at their destination point, Conan reveals that the two people are the jewelry robbers. Conan reveals that they hijacked a car as evidenced by the man's inability to handle the foreign car and how coins were found in the ashtray yet the man is a smoker. Conan apprehends the two culprits and proceeds to the subway. Once there Conan places the CD containing the program the Black Organization wants and places it in a coin locker with a check sticking out of the prearranged locker. Vodka arrives and takes the CD but is stopped by Gin who revealed that there is tape on the CD which means that someone was trying to get his fingerprint. Gin finds a tracker device. He places his hand on the case to find out its warm meaning the one who set up the disk is nearby. Conan manages to hide in a coin locker and passes out due to the lack of oxygen; He is found by Haibara the next day.\n",
    "Disguised as Zombie in Halloween Party (Manga: 429-434, Anime: 345)": "Vermouth sends a signed off-season Halloween party invitation to Kogoro Mouri and to Conan addressed for Shinichi Kudo challenging them to solve a murder on the ship. Conan asks Haibara who is still sick about the name Vermouth, and learns from her reaction that it is the codename of one of the Black Organization members.\nAgasa’s house is still bugged and Conan takes advantage of that to manipulate Vermouth into believing he is going to go to the party. Conan knows at this time Vermouth wants to avoid catching him up in her plan to capture Sherry because of the events at New York in the Golden Apple case.\nGin has been ordered by the boss to look into Vermouth’s movements related to the Halloween party and tells Vodka to board the ship and investigate.

    "Non-canon plot overview": "",
    "Differences in the anime": "In the manga, this case occurred after The Strange Person Hunt Murder Case. In the anime version of this case, Gin and Vodka are replaced with unrelated criminals who look and dress very similarly. The replacement of Gin and Vodka created a continuity error because the episode omitted how Conan learned their codenames, which was important to identifying Tequila as a member of the Black Organization in the Game Company Murder Case. In the Funimation dub, they fixed this continuity error by having Heiji Hattori hint the code names Gin and Vodka.\nIn the manga, this case occurred before The Shinkansen's Bomb Case. In the anime version of this case, Gin was replaced by a similar looking man with glasses who shot but did not kill Akemi Miyano. This created a rather large continuity error.[5] The continuity error was corrected in episode 128. Other information that wound up being delayed included Gin revealing that Akemi had a scientist sister who was valuable to the Organization, and that he was left handed based on how he held his handgun.\nAkemi Miyano, works as a bank teller under the alias \"Masami Hirota\" to prepare for the upcoming robbery. With the assistance of Shirou Kaizuka (a racecar driver) and Kishi (one of the bank guards), Akemi steals one billion yen from a transport van. However, soon after the Black Organization murders Akemi’s two accomplices and a lipstick-smeared facemask is left at the crime scene in order to frame Akemi as the third robber (which she is), who killed her partners to keep all the money herself (which she didn't). Meanwhile, Gin and Vodka meets Masami, who call her Akemi Miyano. Gin asks where the money is. Akemi refuses to reveal the location without them giving up her sister, since she'd done the job on the condition that the two of them could leave after. Gin answers that her sister, as a \"top brain\" in the organization, is too indispensable to have ever considered giving up. Akemi refuses Gin offer of one last chance to reveal the money cache.\n",
    "Special Manga Appearances": "",
    "Relationships analysis": "",
    "Gin": "Vodka is a subordinate of Gin's and they frequently work together as a team, or are seen communicating with one another by phone. Vodka shows Gin absolute respect, using honorifics[6] while speaking with Gin rather than just simply using his codename. Gin in turn values Vodka for his obedience. Gin views and treats Vodka as an \"inexperienced little brother\".[7]\n",
    "Tequila": "Vodka and Tequila are approximately equally ranked, though despite being equals, Tequila is very impatient and easily frustrated with Vodka during their phone call in The Game Company Murder Case. Unlike Vodka, Tequila doesn't use honorifics when referring to Gin, showing that Vodka likely has more respect for Gin given their frequent partnership. Both are Gin's subordinates.[8]\n",
    "Sherry": "Vodka is acquainted with Shiho Miyano, and is just as willing to kill or harm her as Gin, as shown in Reunion with the Black Organization, though likely would leave any finishing blows for Gin to execute. [8]\n",
    "Vermouth": "Throughout the series, Vodka has not been shown as having any negative emotions regarding Vermouth, unlike other members of the organization (like Chianti and Korn). Vodka and Vermouth have been seen along on missions sometimes, but in general they don't pay much attention to each other.\nShe does tease Vodka about his lack of literary knowledge when he fails to understand how Haido Park could be a place most suited for hunting.\n",
    "Chianti": "During the The Black Organization's Scheme, he and Chianti hunt down FBI Agent Andre Camel, and Chianti asks him about what Rum looks like, and Vodka relays the info he knows from Gin regarding Rum. The two seem to have a mutual respect for each other despite their limited interactions together. Just like Tequila, Chianti and Vodka are both subordinates of Gin.\n",
    "Korn": "Korn and Vodka don't interact much, but likely respect each other, and seem to get along fairly well, and both are Gin's subordinates.\n",

    "Name origin": "Vodka is the name of a type of wine made by the distillation of converted substances such as grains, potatoes, or sometimes fruits or sugar.\nVodka's English dub name, Kaspar, is the name of one of the three Magi in Christian tradition.

    "Different looks": "",
    "Quotes": "",
    "Trivia": "- Vodka was the first Black Organization member to appear and speak. In the first episode of the anime, he rushed towards the roller coaster yelling, \"Move it! Move it!

Gin remained silent as they boarded the roller coaster and only uttered his first words after the murder took place.\n- Vodka has never been seen taking off his hat or sunglasses. His eyes were shown only during episode 345.\n"
