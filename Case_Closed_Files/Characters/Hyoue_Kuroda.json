    "Background": "Hyoue Kuroda was originally an officer from the National Police Agency.[1] Seventeen years ago[2] he became the victim of an accident[3], which put him in a ten years long coma. That accident was what caused him to lose his right eye. His hair turned white due to the stress of the accident and he looked like a completely different person, and he says that he's missing a few memories. He was accused of murder but he was cleared due to the bellboy testimony[4] Detective Yui thinks that Kuroda has a prosthetic right eye as a result of the accident that put him in the coma.[5]\nAfter having recovered, Kuroda was assigned to Nagano Prefectural Police as the Chief of the First Division, where he first encountered Conan. Some time after the Kawanakajima murder case, he was transferred to Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department to replace Kiyonaga Matsumoto. He has heard rumors about Conan being 'the brain behind Sleeping Kogoro' and seems to have trust in him.\n",
    "Personality": "Kuroda is a very intimidating man, with the wound around his right eye being especially unnerving. Kogoro, Ayumi, Genta, Mitsuhiko, and even Haibara have been scared by his demeanor and his face. His no nonsense approach to cases, coupled with his enigmatic persona keep those he works closely with on their toes. Unlike other policemen like Jugo Yokomizo, he is willing to listen to others than the police's thoughts on a case, as seen when he tells Kogoro that he is welcome to come with his own thoughts.\n",

    "Plot overview": "",
    "Kawanakajima Murder Case (Manga: 913-917, Anime: 810-812)": "This case marks Kuroda's first appearance. He came to the crime scene right after Shigeru Takeda's head was found in the river. Conan got surprised as he was a well-built and old one-eyed man, which partially fits Haibara's description of Rum. He hinted knowing that Conan was the brain behind the Sleeping Kogoro, which was a rumor he heard from the National Police Agency. Although he may also have heard it from Kansuke Yamato, Yui Uehara, and Taka'aki Morofushi of the Nagano Police, since he was stationed in the Nagano Prefecture at the time.\nHe was shown to be a scary person but in the end he turned out to be on Kansuke Yamato and Taka'aki Morofushi's side, helping them to catch the real killer in the case. Yui Uehara said that he had been in a coma for ten years after an accident and had pitch black hair before that. Kansuke jokely says that with a face like that he looked like a boss of some organization.\n",
    "A Blog That Causes a Death (Manga: 918-920, Anime: 814-815)": "Conan and Haibara were discussing about Kuroda. Ai said that they shouldn't worry because he didn't make any suspicious moves and he was in Nagano, far from the Black Organization. However, at the end of the case it was found out that he had moved to the Tokyo police department replacing Kiyonaga Matsumoto who presumably got promoted. A bit earlier in the case Takagi spoke with him (referring to him as the superintendent), where he gave orders to Megure and Takagi that they should do what Conan tells them to do. When Takagi mentions that he was surprised to learn that Conan knew their new superintendent, he arrives saying that he was confident that Conan could help with the case. He asked Conan to take care of him. Haibara got scared when Kuroda leaned in closer.\n",
    "A Secret of the Big Couple (Manga: 925-927, Anime: 822-823)": "Haibara said to Conan that she hadn't felt the Black Organization Aura from Kuroda. She had only gripped his shoulder because his face and expression were really scary. In fact, she implied Kuroda couldn't be Rum, as he saw her and should have noticed she resembles Shiho Miyano. If this had happened, things would have gone out of control and Rum would've broken into Agasa's house and this didn't happen.\n",
    "Rumi Wakasa's Neighbor Murder Case (Manga: 980, Anime: 896-897)": "Kuroda reads on his phone an article about Rumi Wakasa catching a killer and comments that it was well done.\n",

Shiratori brings Kuroda the file on the robber case that occurred at the elementary school at the time Rumi began working there. Shiratori also informs him that the Detective Boys are going camping with Rumi soon and gives him a pamphlet for the camp grounds. Kuroda goes to the camp grounds and spies on Conan's group through the opening of his tent. The tent next to his catches fire and he is forced to reveal himself. He catches Rumi spaced out staring in his direction and asks her if they should call the police. As Yuminaga's team investigates, Rumi accuses Kuroda of spying on someone.\nBoth to Shiratori and to Yuminaga, Kuroda calls Conan: \"Sleeping Kogoro's bag of wisdom\", perpetuating the rumor further.\n",

    "Zero the Enforcer (Movie: 22)": "Kuroda plays a minor role in this movie, being present at all the police meetings and making a few executive decisons. He is shown making a call to Rei Furuya (Bourbon) however it is unclear whether what he says to Furuya at the end of the call. He is shown saying what appears to be a two syllable word, and one can assume that this could either be \"Zero\" or \"Bourbon\" given the context.\n",

    "Plot Exposition": "",
    "Hints Hyoue Kuroda was not be Rum": "- He met Ai Haibara, who said he might have recognized her as Sherry and taken action against her, though Conan seemed skeptical of the idea and said they should still be careful.\n- He knows Bourbon works for the NPA, but has taken no action against him.\n- With his beard, he may have a hard time presenting himself as the feminine man.\n- Hyoue's current position in the Police force is a Managing Officer of the first division. The police detectives and inspectors of his division would definitely contacting with him for most of the time so if he were to left somewhere unnoticed, it would bring trouble and raise suspicions to himself. His huge body stature would definitely stand out in public, whether in disguise or not, if he was stalking Kogoro's movement.\n- He is aware of Conan being the real brains and actual \"Sleeping Kogoro's Bag of Wisdom\". Gin, however, is still suspicious of only Kogoro himself, not Conan.\n- He might also be a NOC, with the codename RUM.\n",
    "Hints Hyoue Kuroda might be Bourbon's PSB handler": "- He talks to Bourbon on the phone as a superior.\n- He is aware of the Black Organization unlike most of the police. He is aware of the \"ASACA RUM\" code explaining his suspicion on Wakasa Rumi, and he is shown to be aware of Kudo Shinichi's connection with the Black Organization.\n- He is aware of both Bourbon's code name and NPA connection. If he was with the Black Organization, he would have taken action against the 'traitor' and if he was with the police knowing Bourbon's criminal connection but not knowing he is a NOC, he would have been investigating the 'criminal cop'.\n- In file 1030, he probably watched the crime scene video recorded by Kogoro offscreen and noticed Bourbon in it. In addition, he is also aware of Hiromitsu's connection with Bourbon as a fellow officer so he contacted Taka'aki, who was aware of this and presumably ordered him not to strike up a conversation with Bourbon since it would blow his cover as an undercover officer.\n",

Kuroda on the other hand seems to have trust in Conan's abilities, even goes as far as to order the police to follow Conan's instructions. He calls him the 'Brains behind the Sleeping Kogoro'. When Kuroda becomes the new Police Superintendent in Tokyo, he greets Conan with 'Yoroshikuna' (Take care of me) which could mean that he's hoping for Conan's help in the future.\n",
    "Rumi Wakasa": "Hyoue Kuroda seems to have some knowledge about her. When he heard that she went camping with the Detective Boys, he comments that camping was something that she wouldn't do. Kuroda suspects it is possible that she thinks him as the murderer who killed Amanda and Haneda, because there was hostility in her eyes. However, it is more likely that she blames Kuroda for not saving them in time.\n",
