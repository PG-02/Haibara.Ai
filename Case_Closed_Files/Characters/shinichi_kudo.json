    "Background": "Shinichi is a 16-year old[2][7] (17, according to the anime)[4] student at Teitan High School who has become famous for helping the Tokyo police solve murder mysteries. Shinichi was born to Yusaku Kudo, a mystery writer, and Yukiko Kudo, a former movie star.[8]\nHe met Ran when he started in kindergarten and spotted strange things that his father figured out were preparations to kidnap Ran. The kidnapping was foiled, and Ran and Shinichi formed a friendship when Shinichi defended her from the bullies.\nAt some point Both Ran and Shinichi with Ran's parents once visited one of Yoshiro Kinoshita show and took a picture with him.[9]\nThe story begins when Shinichi takes his childhood friend Ran Mouri to a theme park, Tropical Land, to celebrate her victory in a recent karate championship. During the course of their visit, Shinichi ends up solving a murder case. He separates from Ran to follow a man in black, Vodka, who was blackmailing a company president. He didn't notice when another man in black, Gin, sneak up behind him and knocks him out with a baseball bat. Gin decides to test an experimental untraceable poison, APTX 4869, on Shinichi to ensure that his death couldn't be traced back to them. However, instead of killing Shinichi, a rare side-effect occurs: his body shrinks into that of his six-year-old self.[2]\n",
    "Conan Edogawa": "After escaping from well-meaning but skeptical park security, with nowhere else to go Shinichi runs home. He there encounters into his next door neighbor and close family friend, Professor Agasa. He convinces Agasa of his identity and head inside Shinichi's home to discuss the next move. Agasa warns him that he must keep his identity secret because the Black Organization will kill him and others associated with him should they discover the truth.[10]\nRan arrives to find out what happened to Shinichi, which forces him to come up with the alias Conan Edogawa from Arthur Conan Doyle and Edogawa Rampo and he pretends to be a distant relative of Agasa's, who places Conan in Ran's care.[10] Ran's father, Kogoro Mouri, owns a Detective Agency, which will allow Conan to run into cases involving the Black Organization. He occasionally uses Kogoro, and Agasa, among others as a mouthpiece to solve crimes while searching for how to get his body back.\nIn the meantime, to protect his identity he is forced to play the part of a first-year Elementary student, enrolling as a student at Teitan Elementary School. Three of his classmates, Ayumi, Genta, and Mitsuhiko, befriend him and pull him into creating the Detective Boys[11] after which he tries to keep them out of trouble. Their group is later joined by the creator of APTX 4869, Shiho Miyano, shrunk down and using the alias Ai Haibara.\nAlthough he mostly uses the Conan alias to solve cases, in some (especially emergency) situations, he uses the Voice-Changing Bowtie to call the police using his original, Shinichi's voice and get involved with cases, which allow him to gain the authority that Conan lacks. In the aftermath; however, Shinichi requests his identity not to be revealed to the public, a clear contrast to his earlier attention-seeking behavior before turning to Conan.\n",
    "Personality": "At the beginning of the series, Shinichi is already well-known as a brilliant young detective, the \"Savior of the police force\", for solving many difficult cases the professionals could not.[12] He is extremely intelligent, and even from a young age was very intuitive and observant. Due to the influence of his father and the general laissez-faire environment at home, he has long been an incessant and persistent reader, especially of mystery novels.[13] His father, Yusaku started taking Shinichi to crime scenes as a child, which inspired him to be a detective.[14] Due to his bluntness and matter-of-fact manner, Shinichi can come off as rude and arrogant. However, he cares deeply about human life, unable to understand how any reason could be sufficient motive for murder,[15] and is convinced that driving a culprit to suicide is no better than murder itself.[16] The few times he has been too late to save a life haunt him throughout the series. He also thinks of other people's feelings, and in some cases he has been willing to conceal facts from certains parties in order spare them from being scarred from the ugly truth.\nPrior to his transformation, Shinichi enjoyed being in the spotlight and was rather arrogant, reveling in making local headlines and receiving fan-mail. Throughout the series, Shinichi's predicament causes him to gain a sense of humility. Shinichi still keeps his flair for the dramatic (like his mother) that can be seen every time he sets out a deduction in pieces building to a climax.\nDespite his popularity with the masses and his schoolmates, Shinichi has very few close friends. He is close to Ran and Agasa, and after deaging, he befriended Heiji, Haibara, and to some extent the other Detective Boys. Another reason for his lack of close friends was because his arrogant personality was a negative turn-off to many of his classmates and even teachers, making it hard to befriend him. Even with his close friends (one being older than him), Shinichi doesn't hesitate to call them \"idiot\", instead of calmly explaining his reason for doing or not doing something, sometimes causing arguments between him and Ran.\nShinichi also had a tendency, since elementary school, to have an air of being the \"distant, cool guy\". While he is a truly good and heroic individual, he doesn't make it known to others that obviously, and will make some \"deductive reasoning\" for why he did such a thing. His insensitive nature is also horrible, which was shown most prominently during the Holmes' Revelation Arc, when Ran started crying because she believed that Shinichi not telling her he was in London meant that he was indifferent to her feelings for him. However, instead of trying to comfort her, Shinichi repeatedly asked her about the strange woman she met, and told her to pull herself together.\nShinichi was ready to confess his feelings during the Roller Coaster Murder Case but due to Ran's teasing, he didn't. After turning into Conan and knowing that Ran loved him, whenever he turned back into Shinichi, he would try to confess his feelings for her but the antidote running out would foil his attempts. He was successfully able to convey his feelings in London.\nThe reason behind Shinichi's desensitization towards violent and brutal crime scenes is because his father would take him to crime scenes as a child.\nShinichi is also quite fearless, not afraid of being threatened by guns or being surrounded by fire. He also doesn't believe in the supernatural like magic or abnormal creatures and believes there is always an explanation for it. He was also fearless as a child.\n",
    "Appearance": "Shinichi is a handsome above-average height Japanese teenager with a light-complexion, pale skin and a thin lean yet athletic build. He has blue eyes and short dark brown/black hair with a cowlick in front and distinctive tuft in the back. Shinichi bears a striking resemblance to his father, Yusaku Kudo albeit a less defined jawline and minus his father's mustache. Often, he is well-noted as very handsome as he became very popular with the girls around his age, regularly getting love letters, which has only grown since becoming a famous detective. Shinichi often appears in his high school uniform, but he also wears a suit and tie or regular clothing depending on the occasion. When Conan turns back into Shinichi by using paikaru or the prototype antidote, Shinichi will wear whatever appropriately sized clothing he can find at the time.\n",
    "Skills": "",
    "Intelligence": "Consistently, Shinichi has proven himself to be a very sharp-witted and calculating individual. While only in high school, his passion mysterious have lead him to be a very well-read to showcase advanced knowledge and understanding in a myriad of subjects, which he can methodically use to aid him in investigations. His detective skills often earns him comparisons to Sherlock Holmes. Shinichi has acquired various nicknames because of his prowess, such as the \"Heisei Holmes\" and the \"Detective of the East\". He has a keen eye for details, and can spot any unusual aspects in a case that most people tend to miss or not take into account. He has a keen understanding for criminal psychology, occasionally being able to sense if someone is the true criminal. He can also predict movement and plan of the criminals, and in some cases, he used this skill to \"bluff\". By deliberately giving wrong deduction, he managed to make the criminal reveal the key evidence of the case, confess, abandon suicide's attempt, or lead them to the wrong ends. He repeatedly demonstrates an eidetic memory and perfect recall, able to recount every aspect from the situation he has placed himself in. Shinichi's fastidious attention to detail allows him to notice minor inconsistencies in crime scenes and suspect testimony, and using astute logic he uncovers the reasons behind those inconsistencies in order to link them to the crime. Shinichi has extraordinarily broad and deep knowledge of many subjects and trivia that help him solve cases. Few people are able to match wits with him, including Heiji Hattori and Kaito Kuroba, while only his father, Yusaku Kudo, has shown able consistently proven himself to far surpass his son, both solving mysterious well-before Shinichi and even regularly tricking his on for \"tests\".\n",
    "Language": "Besides his native language, Shinichi is fluent in reading/writing and speaking English, as seen when he solved a case in London without evidence of any language barrier.[17][18] Shinichi also knows German,[19], Italian,[20] and French.[21] Shinichi seems to understand \"Girl Writing\", due to the fact that he had solved an e-mail cipher of a 2nd year high school girl quickly.[22]\n",
    "Athletic ability": "Like his intelligence, Shinichi also has an amazing athletic ability. Shinichi is an extremely skilled soccer player, having been professionally scouted while only in middle school, but he chooses to stay at the amateur level. He initially played to hone his reflexes and coordination as he often juggles a ball to clear his mind, but he is also an enthusiastic fan of the sport in its own right.[12] While naturally right-handed and right-footed, Shinichi trained himself to be ambidextrous, being just as efficient with either hand or foot. Against criminals, his signature technique is launching various objects with superb precision from his kick to knock the foe out. Shinichi's kick is accurate over long distances and he is capable of mentally reckoning the angle of impact necessary to rebound a soccer ball off a wall and strike an attacker from behind. He is also good at skiing, snowboarding, and ice-skating. Likewise, on a skateboard he can easily perform very complicated tricks and dodges with his skateboard at high speed.\nAside from sports, Shinichi exhibits a knack and impeccable accuracy for handling firearms due to his father taking him to shooting ranges from time to time. During the Clocktower Heist, Shinichi is able to shoot and dislodge the support beam of a giant projection screen with a single shot from a moving helicopter. Additionally, in The Fourteenth Target, as Conan, he shot a bullet at Ran's leg with such precision, that while it rendered her unable to walk to force the criminal to let her go, but afterwards her leg healed cleanly with no lingering signs or damage. Between his natural aim and coordination, he can likewise hit his target shooting darts like in The Detective Boys Get Out of the Rain, when he throws them to a giant Gomera puppet so it can fall on the culprit.\nShinichi is nimble as well as strong. He is capable of considerable acrobatics, jumping great distances and swinging from tree to tree to escape onlookers.[23] Shinichi is also well-trained in martial arts, showing remarkable flexibility and precision in his kicks, noted for having an especially good roundhouse kick. With his proficiency, as seen in Shiragami Case, he disarms the culprit trying to commit suicide. Even against the expert judo practitioner Kogoro, in Drama Episode 13, he avoided Kogoro and take him down as he tries to hurt him. While it is unclear where his skill compares to Ran, he can effortlessly dodge a kicking assault from an angry Ran, something very few have ever managed. How does however openly acknowledge Ran as stronger than him.\n",
    "Music": "Shinichi cannot sing on key in the slightest so he is often accused of being tone deaf. Despite being a hilariously awful singer, Shinichi has perfect pitch and can identify notes accurately even in difficult contexts like the sound of phone button presses forming a melody.[24] Also, he can replicate and sing dial tones for a phone, showing that the reason he can't sing is because he simply doesn't have relative pitch. Like his favorite detective, Sherlock Holmes, he plays the violin. This was confirmed in Full Score of Fear, when he played \"Amazing Grace\" for Ran. However, he is stumped on what Ran meant when she said, \"He has a funny habit when he plays.\"\n",
    "Other skills": "He has remarkable intuition, able to tell when people are spying on him and if they are hiding something. He can defuse a bomb effortlessly without external instruction. Shinichi has repeatedly dispensed first aid to stabbed/shot/cardiac/poisoned/hurt victims before the rescuers arrive. He is also shown able to read lips.[25] Having seemingly inherited his mother's acting talent, he can seamlessly change his persona, as seen from his longstanding deception of the carefree child Conan. He is skilled in impersonation, able to mimic other people's voices, once pretending to be Heji, however he can have some difficultly changing his dialect. He has skills in computer programming and hacking, however they are inferior Haibara's, regularly relying on her to help out; he was not able to crack Black Organization's encrypted data. In non-canon movie 2 he was able to pilot a helicopter as he had been training with a simulator since he was a kid. In non-canon movie 5 he was able to drive a car.\n",
    "Appellations": "\n",
    "Plot overview": "Because the main plot revolves around the fact that Shinichi has become 'Conan' and is forced into hiding, Shinichi is rarely in the series as himself. However, Conan is frequently shown calling Ran using his voice-changing bow tie to sound like Shinichi and sending/receiving text messages from her with \"Shinichi's\" phone. In these instances, it can be said that the character of Shinichi, albeit in the body of Conan, is appearing, since these phone conversations and text messages allow Shinichi to be himself, however briefly. The below instances however, are actual appearances of Shinichi as well as flashbacks from before the series began.\n",
    "Transformation into Conan": "Shinichi starts as himself in the Roller coaster murder case, but by the end he has been transformed into Conan, thus beginning the series' plot. Since then, Conan has temporarily turned back to Shinichi several times.\n",
    "Transformations back into Shinichi": "Heiji was injured and Kazuha kidnapped; her abductors threatened to kill her unless Heiji showed up for her. Believing Heiji to be unable to do so, Conan contacted Ai and asked if there was any way for him to briefly become Heiji. Ai gave him medicine to simulate the effects of a cold, then he drank some paikaru which had changed him in his and Heiji's first manga appearance. Conan became Shinichi for approximately an hour, but according to Ai he was extremely weak and sick for the entire time.\nConan takes another prototype antidote. However, it proves less effective than the prototype he used during the Desperate Revival arc; Conan became Shinichi, but only for a few hours, and remained in a feverish state, unable to wake up until he had reverted back to Conan. During his time unconscious, he had a vivid hallucination that he had grown to age 17 again as Conan and that Ran, aged 27, was about to marry Tomoaki Araide.\n",
    "Flashback appearances": "One year ago, Shinichi solved his first case by himself on a plane flying to Los Angeles.\nOne year ago, Shinichi, Ran, and his mother went to New York City to see the play \"Golden Apple\". There, they encountered Sharon Vineyard and Shuichi Akai.\nDuring a call to Conan, Heiji talks about a brilliant detective kid he met at a skiing trip during middle school, 3 years ago. That kid was actually Shinichi, who he competed with to solve the mystery.\nA flashback revealed that 10 years ago, as first-graders, Shinichi and Ran had been given a riddle by the original Kaitou Kid, Toichi Kuroba.\nDuring an aquarium visit with Conan and the Detective Boys, Ran remembers going to the aquarium with Shinichi almost a year ago. After solving a murder case there, it is revealed how Shinichi came to promise Ran their trip to Tropical Land.\n13 years ago Ran and Shinichi meet for the first time in pre-school.\n10 years ago Shinichi and Ran encounter the Akai family at the beach.\n",
    "Non-canon plot overview": "",
    "Flashback Appearances": "The first meeting of Shinichi and the current Kaitou Kid, Kaito Kuroba.\n",
    "Relationships analysis": "Since Shinichi is not featured as prominently as Conan throughout the series, only a few of his relationships with other characters have been substantially explored.\n",
    "Family and friends": "Ran Mouri is Shinichi's childhood friend and canonical love interest. They have been friends and playmates since kindergarten[13][49], though Shinichi's tendency to drag Ran along into minor trouble caused some censure from her mother. Shinichi has liked Ran since they were little. It was revealed when he is in the first year of middle school, and turned down any other potential love interests as a result, but she has never realized this.[50] Shinichi was similarly oblivious to Ran's regard until Ran confessed to Conan that despite his faults, which she is well aware of, she has liked Shinichi for some time.[51] He is extremely protective of her, and has been amazed by her various skills and kindness on more than one occasion. Shinichi has since confessed his feelings to Ran in the non-canon 4th movie 'Captured In Her Eyes' (which Ran mistook as his attempt to get her memories back), and made attempts to say something during temporary cures in the manga and anime, but cases always seem to interfere until the cure runs out. Shinichi since then has finally canonically confessed to Ran in the case in London.[52] Shinichi had been waiting for her reply, and finally in the Scarlet School Trip arc, Ran kissed Shinichi on the cheek as her answer for his confession in London. Immediately, Shinichi tries to do a proper kiss with Ran, only for the antidote's effects to wear off; turning him back into Conan. But he was elated because they were able to confirm that they are indeed 'boyfriend' and girlfriend' now. Shinichi has many times now admitted that Ran is the most important person to him / the one he loves the most.\nShinichi's initial disappearance troubled Ran to the point of insomnia and nearly going to the police. Since then, Shinichi sometimes calls Ran over the telephone and imitates his normal voice with the voice-changing bowtie so that she doesn't worry about him. He convinces her that he is off solving a very difficult case and will return once the investigation concludes.[53] In reality, he is the brain behind her father's rapid rise to fame as a detective.\nA touching fact is that no matter the time or the circumstance, Conan always picks up the phone when Ran calls 'Shinichi'.\nShinichi/Conan is not without sexual fantasies regarding Ran, the most obvious evidence being his nosebleeds or blushing when he sees her in a bathing suit[54], or when Ran pulled him into an onsen with her.[55] For her part, Ran often blushes when thinking of Shinichi, especially when Sonoko teases her about their relationship. Her attitude towards Conan is one of more open, sisterly affection, such as giving him hugs or holding his hand. Shinichi has some concerns of bodily harm should Ran realize that not only has he been lying to her, but they've shared a bed and taken a bath together.[56]\nShinichi and Ran share a close empathic link due to their strong feelings for each other, making each of them feel the other's worry and agitation in times of extreme danger.[57]\nYusaku and Yukiko Kudo are both aware that Conan is in fact Shinichi. His parents are even more famous than he is, with Yusaku being a famous mystery novelist and Yukiko being a retired actress who remains partially involved in the industry. They currently live in the United States and travel extensively, having left Shinichi in Japan on his own when he was fourteen. Though he sometimes finds his parents' carefree ways to be annoying, he loves them dearly. Yusaku is also a detective with the same keen eye for details, and similarly to Holmes' brother Mycroft, Yusaku always seems to solve a case one step ahead of his son.\nAlthough not related by blood, there is a strong family-like bond between Shinichi and Hiroshi Agasa. Agasa was the first to know about Shinichi's shrunk predicament and was the one to tell him to keep it a secret. Most of the gadgets that Shinichi has were made by Agasa to help Shinichi catch the criminals and solve the cases as Conan. He also knows about Shinichi's romantic relationship with Ran and sometimes teases him about it in front of her (when Shinichi can't do anything about it since he is Conan).\nWhen they first meet, Conan and Heiji seemed bound to become lifelong rivals, especially after Kudo beats Heiji in their first case. But even though Heiji discovers Shinichi's secret, he decides to keep quiet (though he often slips up and calls him Kudo in front of Ran and others). After Heiji realizes the truth, the two have become best friends, and consult one another on cases, developments concerning the Black Organization, and even their girlfriends. They have solved many cases together, and Heiji is the person Shinichi turns to for advice or for confirmation regarding a deduction. Heiji has, on several occasions, declared and proven himself to be Shinichi's best friend or brother.\nHeiji still maintains some of his original feelings of rivalry, and gets annoyed if anyone claims Shinichi is better (or even equal), and will often go to great lengths to show that the \"west\" (Osaka) is better than the \"east\" (Tokyo). Shinichi usually starts off acting like he is disinterested in the frivolous competition, but may then become competitive himself if Heiji starts \"winning\" or someone bruises his ego. Others, like Ran and Kazuha, see them both as equally skilled detectives.\nIn canon, Heiji is also seen piggybacking Conan, as Conan has shrunken and cannot run as fast as Hattori. Their close friendship has been noted several times by Ran and Kazuha.\nSonoko and Shinichi have known each other since childhood. Sonoko finds Shinichi's obsession with mysteries annoying and considers him to be an arrogant showoff.[citation needed] That being said, she acknowledges his knowledge and intelligence. Sonoko enjoys teasing him about his relationship with Ran, calling them husband and wife or boyfriend / girlfriend. Shinichi finds her attempts at attracting boys to be rather irritating. Sonoko is one of the few people who calls Shinichi by his first name with honorofic kun. Shinichi also calls Sonoko by her first name without including any honorific. Sonoko would sometimes send Shinichi photographs of important moments including Ran; for example when Kogoro was acquitted, Sonoko was about to take a photo of the reunion between Ran, Kisaki, and Kogoro to send to Shinichi but was interrupted when the electricity shuts down (Zero The Enforcer), sometimes sneakily sending pictures of Ran to prompt Shinichi to come back, and during 'The Scarlet School Trip' when Ran was talking with Okita Soshi away from the group. Although Sonoko would sometimes tease Ran and tell him to forget about Shinichi, she supports the relationship between the two and is indirectly responsible for pushing Shinichi to ask for a reply from Ran regarding his confession.\n",
    "Detective Boys": "So far, Shinichi did not canonically meet the detective boys before becoming Conan. In the non-canonical animated special, OVA Magic File 2, four years prior to him becoming Conan, a thirteen-year-old Shinichi came across the Detective Boys, Genta, Mitsuhiko, and Ayumi, while they were still three years old. He needed their help in confirming a client's alibi. Also, in the first live action drama and the first episode of the anime[58], the Detective Boys are seen sneaking into Tropical Land for treasure. Ran then says, pointing to the children, \"It was like that last time, huh?\" to Shinichi. In the Desperate Revival Arc, Shinichi meets the Detective Boys one morning and greets them as Conan used to, but they were of course hesitant to greet him back.\nBoth are de-aged by APTX4869 and have almost equal levels of intelligence, which makes Ai Haibara and Conan confidants and more empathetic with each other than other characters. They share an interesting relationship. They believe and rely on each other. She certainly has no qualms about teasing him, and is more than willing to poke a hole in his ego. While Conan initially was disgusted by Ai's ties to the Black Organization, especially with how she introduced herself, seeing her remorse and pain has improved his opinion of her. He is protective of her as is his nature, and tries to give her hope whenever her fear of the men in black is overwhelming.\n",
    "Law enforcement": "Inspector Megure has worked together with Shinichi to solve many cases. During Shinichi's first case on the plane, Megure mentions that he has not seen him since he was in his 6th year of Elementary school. Megure seemed irritated that Shinichi was poking his nose into a murder case. Since then, because Shinichi has proven himself solving cases one after the other, Megure has grown to respect Shinichi and his deductive abilities, thanking him for his assistance.\n",
    "Others": "Despite the fact Toichi and Shinichi only met once prior to Toichi's death, it's worth mentioning that Toichi referred to Shinichi as his \"older brother\" and himself as the \"younger brother\". This is because Yusaku created and thus was the father of the moniker Kaitou Kid, Toichi's secret identity. Toichi's son and successor, Kaito, has also only crossed paths with Shinichi as Shinichi once, during the Clocktower heist. Kaito thought Shinichi made the heist harder (and thus less boring) in Saguru Hakuba's absence, and Shinichi found Kid's intention of 'stealing' the Clocktower in order to save it from demolition to be fairly admirable. Notably, neither of them saw the other's face.\nIn their next encounter, however, after Shinichi had become Conan, Kid disguised himself as Ran in order to steal the Suzuki Black Star pearl. When Conan cornered him on the Suzuki cruise ship, Kid suggested that he'd stolen all of Ran's clothes to impersonate her, and left her naked on the deck. While this ended up being a bluff, Conan was shocked and infuriated. In subsequent encounters between Kid and Conan, Conan displays a much more intense desire to capture Kid. In several instances he appears to be able to 'sense' Kid's presence; knowing Kid is close by often causes Conan to behave far more frenetically. However, in several instances, beginning with the \"Big Adventure in the Eccentric Residence\" case, when Kid does Conan/Shinichi a favor, such as saving Genta's life in the aforementioned case, Conan reciprocates by halting his investigation just shy of capturing Kid, thereby allowing him to escape unhindered.\n",
    "People who know Conan's real identity": "There are only a few characters in the series who know Conan's real identity and none have betrayed Conan's identity to date. The main characters to know the secret are Hiroshi Agasa, Conan's parents, Heiji Hattori and Ai Haibara. Vermouth also knows, but she has kept it a secret from the rest of the Organization to protect Shinichi because he had saved her life in New York. Eisuke Hondou, the younger brother of C.I.A. agent Hidemi Hondou, also knows and keeps Conan's secret.Kaitou Kid was first aware of Conan's identity in the movies, showing up as Shinichi in the third movie to protect Conan's identity, making it non-canon. Canonically however, File 1018 implies that Kaito is aware of Conan's secret, as he addresses Conan and Heiji as \"the high-school detectives\". Ran gets suspicious on occasion, but so far Conan has managed to trick her into thinking Conan and Shinichi are two different people. Also, Subaru Okiya has seen Conan use Shinichi's voice with his bowtie voice modifier. Since Subaru Okiya is actually Shuichi Akai in disguise, this means that Akai knows about it as well.\n",
    "Character popularity": "- In a Newtype poll from 2001, Shinichi ranked fourth in the category \"Top 10 Most Popular Male Anime Characters in Japan.\"[59] In a Newtype Magazine poll from March 2010, Shinichi was voted as the ninth most popular male anime character from the 1990's.[60]\n- In the survey \"Friendship\" developed by rankingjapan.com in which people had to choose what anime character they would like to have as a friend, Shinichi ranked third.[61]\n- eBookJapan held a character popularity poll from April 12, 2011 to May 12, 2011 in which readers of Detective Conan (international included) could vote for their favorite character. Shinichi placed 2nd in the poll with 1,425 votes out of the 5,883 that were cast.[62]\n- Shinichi placed 1st in the results of a poll ranking the top 3 \"ikemen\" (\"good-looking men\") of the series aired during the promotional special for The Lost Ship in the Sky.[63]\n- In honor of the release of the 15th movie, Quarter of Silence, the official Conan movie website held a popularity poll for the top 10 Detective Conan characters.

Shinichi placed 4th overall with 1,443 votes[65].\n- In a poll held on June 5, 2020 by asking women age 20 to 40 who were their favourite Detective Conan character, Shinichi ranked second[66].\n",
    "Name origin": "Shinichi's given name is a pun on \"one truth\". The \"ichi\" (一) means \"one\" and \"shin\" can be read as truth (真), however the kanji actually used for \"shin\" (新) in Shinichi's name means \"new\".[67] Shinichi's family name \"Kudo\" comes from the fictional detective Shunsaku Kudo created by Nobumitsu Kodaka.[68] The ON-readings of the kanji for \"Kudo\" mean \"craft\" or \"construction\" (工) and \"wisteria\" (藤).[69]\n\"Shinichi\" may also have come from \"Shinichi Suzuki\", a famous violinist. Shinichi Kudo plays violin.[70]\n",
    "Character inspiration": "Shinichi's design was based off of Conan's. Gosho said Shinichi's hairstyle was designed in about one minute. He smoothed Yaiba's hair and added a tuft modeled after the apostrophe hairstyle of Kabu from Sally the Witch. The tuft on hair on the top of Shinichi's head comes from the character Shichimi in Niji Iro Tōgarashi. Shinichi's speech habits were meant to be slightly rough like Joe from Ashita no Joe and Touch.[71]\n",

He then runs this information against a database of Tokyo teenagers and comes up with a list of possible Kaitou Kids, at the top of which was Kaito Kuroba's name. However, it's interesting to wonder whether Shinichi, another sixteen-year-old Tokyo resident with a similar build and above-average intelligence, made Saguru's list, but the search included only teenagers with blood type B, and it has never actually been stated what Shinichi's is (although Kogoro Mouri mentions that Conan's blood type is rare[75]). Type B is not a common blood type[76], so it is possible that this is Shinichi's type.\n"
