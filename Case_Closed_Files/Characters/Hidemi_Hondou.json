    "Background": "Hidemi Hondou is an undercover CIA agent who has managed to infiltrate the Black Organization under the codename Kir. She has a younger brother named Eisuke. Her father, Ethan Hondou, who was also in the CIA and undercover, committed suicide in order to save his daughter after a mistake nearly caused her to lose her cover in the organization.\nWhen both were much younger, she once donated bone marrow to Eisuke to cure his leukemia, and this resulted in Eisuke's blood type changing from O to AB. Some time later, when Eisuke was injured in a car accident, Hidemi donated blood to him, which she was able to because they now had same blood type.\nAfter joining the CIA, Hidemi was sent back to Japan to work with her father, who was undercover in the Black Organization. Her original mission was to help a middleman, Barney, in, since the one that her father normally used had been killed. After that she was supposed to fake death and leave the organization. But due to her imprudence, her father and Barney had to commit suicide, and Hidemi was forced to stay and continue her father's mission. The boss of the organization was impressed by her false report of Ethan Hondou's death and granted her the codename Kir soon after.\nConan first encountered Hidemi as a newscaster under the alias Rena Mizunashi when she asked Kogoro to solve a trivial stalking case. She wanted the detective's phone number to ask him to protect Eisuke, who had become suspicious of her. After the stalking case was solved, Conan discovered (accidentally) that she was a codenamed Black Organization member and a leading participant in an assassination plot. He managed to squander the first assassination attempt with the aid of the FBI, so the Black Organization changed their plan and Hidemi was ordered to head to another place. She suffered an accident on the way and fell into a coma, whereupon she was sent to a hospital secretly by the FBI, who was closely following her at the time of the accident. Knowing that Kir had fallen into the hands of their enemies, the Black Organization began searching for her frantically, and so did Eisuke. Later, the FBI and Conan discovered her true allegiance and deliberately allowed the Black Organization to recapture her so the she could continue her infiltration mission. Eisuke also learnt that she was working for the CIA; this, along with other factors, inspired him to head to the United States in pursuit of the same career.\n",
    "Personality": "Despite having to maintain her cover within the Black Organization, Hidemi remains a compassionate person and attempts to preserve as many lives as she can. Having seen him in action, she has come to trust Conan and his judgments implicitly. Among the members of the Black Organization though, she appears to be cold and obedient to her superiors, but she acts a bit more merciful than the others, causing Gin to get suspicious of her at times.\n",

    "Plot overview": "",
    "Black Impact (Manga: 499-504, Anime: 425)": "Hidemi first meets Conan in her newscaster identity. Rena has, for some time, been stalked at her own housedoor, with someone ringing her doorbell on Saturdays and sleeping pills being left on her doorstep. Rena's friend Yoko decides to call in Kogoro, who goes to her apartment in Ran and Conan's company. In order to track down the culprit, Conan pastes a bug next to her door.Eventually, the stalker turns out to be a young boy. The boy is a fan of Rena (because his late mother ostensibly resembled Hidemi), and when she was transferred to a different time, he thought that the reason she did not show up on TV was that she had overslept. So he decided to ring the doorbell to wake her up in order to see her more regularly on TV, and he deposited the pills so she could have more restful sleeps. Facing these facts, Rena gently encourages the boy to get over his mother's death and look forward. Shortly after Conan and the others leaves, Rena also departs, but in the process Conan's bug falls off and accidentally gets stuck to the sole of her shoe. Right afterwards, to Conan's immense shock, Rena makes a call to no one other than Gin, who directs her to assassinate a popular politician; under the guise of a TV interview, Rena is to guide him to a place where he could be easily dispatched.\nConan of course decides to intervene, and he, Professor Agasa and Haibara take up the pursuit, during which they also meet Jodie (who has tagged along as well). They just barely manage to thwart the assassination, but the Organization has a backup plan, with Rena pursuing their target on a motorbike. FBI attempts to apprehend her on her way, and an accident (unrelated to the FBI's actions) ensues in which Rena is severely injured and falls into a coma. She is sent to the Haido Central Hospital and is kept under the FBI's constant guard.\n",
    "Eisuke's First Appearance (Manga: 508-510, Anime: 429-430)": "Shortly after Rena is hospitalized, a clumsy young man named Eisuke Hondou moves into the neighborhood and decides to tag along with Kogoro. His suspicious behavior and his astonishing physical similarity to Rena lead Conan to believe that he is somehow in cahoots with her.\n",
    "Clash of Red and Black (Manga: 595-609, Anime: 495-504)": "In time it turns out that Eisuke is in fact Rena/Hidemi's younger brother, and that he has been looking for her after her inexplicable disappearance. And Hidemi herself is in fact an agent of the CIA who has taken her father's place as a mole in the Black Organization following a blunder on her part.\n",
    "Akai's death at Raiha Pass (Manga: 605-609, Anime: 501-504)": "Gin is suspicious of how ineffective the FBI's plan was and that Akai barely interfered with the recapture at all. This makes him think that Akai is still hiding something; soon, this doubt is relayed to the boss, who plans a test of Kir's loyalty. Meanwhile, Andre Camel becomes a suspect in an unrelated murder case. The Black Organization hears about it, and taking advantage of the FBI being distracted, Gin orders Kir to call Akai out to meet with her and kill him to regain the boss' trust. Kir meets with Akai at Raiha Pass and apparently kills him, but, in reality, Akai survives, thanks to the plan that he, Kir, and Conan have come up with.\n",
    "Red, White, and Yellow Arson case (Manga: 622-624, Anime: 509-510)": "After having regained her standing in the Black Organization, she continues to feed information to both the CIA and the FBI, including that an agent named Bourbon has been sent to track down the renegade, Sherry.[3]\n",
    "Department Store Bomber Case (Manga: 700-704, Anime: 578-581)": "After seeing the news regarding the department bomber case, the organization spotted Scar Akai coincidentally recorded in the news. Although Vodka assumed that the person's just a splitting image of Akai, since there's no way that he is alive as they witness Shuichi's death being executed through the video transmitted from the camera that was attached in Kir's collar. Gin couldn't believe that was just a coincidence, hence his suspicion towards Kir arises again assuming that she and Shuichi might have set up some kind of trick to deceive them. However, Kir denied any of it saying, \"I only did that because you were the one who told me to shoot him in the head... not to mention that you were also the one who told me to call him to Raiha Pass... Afterward, I was under the organization's watch up until I met him there. With that, how could I have pulled any type of trick?\" She then added, \"That is unless you're implying he or I had superhuman brainpower that allowed us to calculate that far ahead; maybe then we could have tricked you. Yes, a mind like that of Sherlock Holmes. So how about you quit it with your strange doubts, and just be truly happy that our enemy is dead?\". Gin ultimately relents due to Vermouth telling him what was really happening, and, thus, Kir manages to survive the situation.\n",
    "Scarlet Epilogue (Manga: 898, Anime: 783)": "Rena sends a brief message to Akai, telling him that the second-in-command of the organization, \"RUM\", is on the move.\n",
    "FBI Serial Murder Case (Manga: 1061-1066, Anime: 1077-1079)": "Kir appears with the organization to join the operation of eliminating the FBI. She joins with Vermouth and shoots Camel at Umibotaru, causing him to fall into the sea. However, Gin notices a fire at Umizarujima and decides to find Camel due to Korn remembering that he has seen Camel before. They arrive at Umizarujima and split up to search for Camel. During this, she secretly contacts Akai to tell him about the organization's operation and that this time she will shoot Camel's face if the organization orders her to. Camel manages to fake his death in front of the organization. After that, Vermouth shows Camel's photo to Korn and remembers Camel is the photo from Rum sent to him 2 years ago instead of the operation of rescuing her from Clash of Red and Black. Thus, Kir once again manages to survive the situation.\n",

    "Hints that Hidemi was the biological older sister of Eisuke Hondou": "- They look alike. Both have unique matching eye designs.\n- Rena Mizunashi mentioned having a little brother just after the Ding-Dong Dash case. After hearing that the child's mother died, which mirrors her own family situation[4], she became emotional to the point of crying. Conan noted a similar reaction of Eisuke's later[5] likely meant he wasn't acting.\n- Eisuke has a mark on his chest where a needle was inserted to monitor his leukemia.[6] A nurse later revealed that he has leukemia and was given a bone marrow transplant. Bone marrow transplants change the blood type of the receiver to that of the marrow donor, so Eisuke's blood type changed from type O to type AB. Later his sister was able to donate AB blood to him because of this.\n- Hidemi and Eisuke both use the same classical lie detection technique - feeling for the pulse while watching the pupils - which is taught by some American law enforcement agencies.\n",
    "Hints that Hidemi was a member of the CIA and not loyal to the Black Organization": "- Hidemi asked for help on a case from Kogoro. Haibara points out that this is strange behavior for a Black Org agent.[7] It is later revealed that she asked Kogoro for help because she was going to ask him to protect Eisuke because Hidemi knew that she couldn't keep Eisuke away from her.\n- In her introductory case, Hidemi uses several stock CIA expressions, such as a Japanese transliteration of a quote from John F. Kennedy's speech at CIA headquarters, \"Your successes are unheralded--your failures are trumpeted.\"[8][9]\n- Conan discovered that Ethan Hondou, Eisuke Hondou's father, was a member of \"The Company\" - a nickname for the CIA. If Eisuke is Hidemi's sister, as Conan discovered because of Eisuke's surgery, that means Hidemi's father was in the CIA, and thus it is possible she followed in her father's footsteps.\n- Kir hesitates right before she directs Domon to the bench where he will be assassinated, showing that she has second thoughts about what she is doing.[10]\n- Despite hearing Jodie's silenced gunshots that damage the sprinklers, Kir does not report this interference to Gin.[11]\n- She uses a classical lie detection technique - feeling for the pulse while watching the pupils - which is taught by some American law enforcement agencies.[12]\n- Conan is caught by Kir when he rushes up to take the tracker off of her shoe, and she uses the aforementioned lie detection technique to ask Conan \"Did you follow me here?\" Conan denies it, but assuming Kir is competent, she would have spotted the lie. She then tells Conan, \"Thank you... for picking my shoe up... I owe you one. Really...\" Such a level of thanks and relief is more than necessary. Combining her knowledge of the sprinkler related interference and Conan's lie she guessed he was there to interfere with the assassination and was grateful that he helped stop her from having to help the Organization assassinate Domon.[13]\n",
    "Relationships analysis": "",
    "Family and friends": "Hidemi was very close to Eisuke when he was a child, and visited him and their mother during holidays.\nWhile infiltrating the Black Organization, Hidemi had to cut off all contact with her family, including Eisuke. Eisuke never gave up on finding his older sister even though she left when Eisuke was only about seven. Hidemi seems to care a lot about Eisuke despite them being separated for years, and when she discovers that Eisuke has been looking for clues of her, she risks a meeting with Kogoro, hoping to convince him to take Eisuke away from her and keep him safe. It is unknown whether she is aware that Eisuke has decided to turn down the witness protection program and head to the US in order to follow her and his father's path.\n",
    "Black Organization": "Even though Kir has managed to fake Shuichi Akai's death successfully by shooting at his head at close range in front of Gin's eyes, Gin is still suspicious of Akai being alive and Kir's allegiance to the Black Organization.\n",
    "Name origin": "According to Akai, her alias Rena Mizunashi is actually a mnemonic for 007, the service number of fictional secret agent James Bond. \"Mizunashi\", meaning \"no water\", is a subtle reference to zero. \"Rena\" is a contraction of the numbers zero (rei) and seven (nana). \"Hondou\" from Hidemi Hondou comes from \"Bondo\" (ボンド), the Japanese pronounciation of (James) Bond.\n",
    "Different looks": "",
    "Trivia": "- Kir is a cocktail made of crème de cassis and white wine. Depending on how one looks at it, it breaks the Black Organization codename pattern for women because it is a wine-based cocktail rather than a straight variety of wine. However, it still has something to do with wine regardless, and thus, one way or another, still goes along with the pattern of women having wine-related codenames.\n- Kir is seen driving two different cars; a silver 1987 Citroën BX GTi 16v Série 2 during episode 425, and a dark coloured NC Mazda MX-5 with the power-retractable hardtop during episode 504.\n- According to BLACK PLUS Super Digest Book Kir was working as an announcer because she found out that she had the talent for it.\n",
