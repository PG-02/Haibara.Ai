    "Background": "Renya Karasuma was a wealthy and influential multi-millionaire who was the most powerful person in all of modern Japan, with an extensive range of contacts all over in the world. He is richer than the Suzuki plutocrats in Tokyo and the Ooka family in Kyoto.[1] He is said to have died at over 100 years old about fourty years ago, under quite mysterious circumstances and his legacy is unknown. During his lifetime, he had collected over three hundred pieces of priceless art and antiques. About sixty-seven years ago, as a guest at his birthday party, he met Amanda Hughes, an American VIP.\nWhen his mother died, he inherited the Sunset Manor, a huge western-style manor house, and over time filled his vacation home with his silver crest which depicts a rolled-up crow. Forty years ago, he found a clue leading to a vast fortune left by his mother supposedly hidden in the manor, but he was unable to solve it himself. Consumed by his own greed for the treasure, he hired people to solve the riddle for him and then began killing them as motivation for the others to work faster. After his supposed death, the Karasuma family died out and the house fell into other hands.\nHe founded the shady Karasuma Group, a big company in Tokyo that pays well as a sponsor but is associated with various bad rumors. He is the man at the center of it all, directing illegal activities and planning crimes to protect and advance the interests of those Conan calls the \"Black Organization\". While mysteriously operating behind the scenes, the boss communicates with his ruthless subordinates only through text messages. His phone number, encoded as the famous children's song Nanatsu no Ko, is #969#6261. He is responsible for promoting agents deemed worthy and deciding on their alcoholic codenames, but he does not have one of his own because he is the big boss and does not need a codename. However, he does not want anyone in the organization to know about his current location.\n",
    "Personality": "He is described as a greedy, corrupt, cruel, and impatient man. He is materialistic as driven by his own greed while searching for the hidden treasure inside the Sunset Manor. Furthermore, he doesn't value human life, as brutally killed numerous innocent people that he invited just as motivation to find the treasure faster. Wise and quiet, intelligent and manipulative, he is ruthless, willing to dispatch senior agents who have been extremely loyal to him for many years for a single mistake. Vermouth says that he is always careful to the extreme, the type to ruin the plan by overthinking it. Somehow, he can maintain loyalty and unity within the organization, despite many members disliking or even outright wishing to murder certain others. The FBI believed he was hoping to nip a potential obstacle in the bud, because a politician hard on crime and not part of the Diet yet may have a chance of becoming the next Prime Minister. He thought Akai could become a silver bullet, someone who is especially dangerous to the entire organization. Unless he brought Conan back alive, Irish thought his true identity is something the boss would find hard to believe.\n",
    "Appearance": "He is a crow-like man who has only appeared as an ominous shape. He is bald on the top of his head with the rest of his hair extended to the neck, with a large nose shaped like a beak, and a somewhat obese body shape. His eyes are drooping. He dressed in black with a white scarf, held his left arm behind the back and a walking stick with a ball handle on his right hand with long nails like a bird's leg, and on his left shoulder there is a pet crow, the creepy bird which is also depicted on his crest. He is right-handed.\n",
    "Plot overview": "",
    "Sunset Mansion Case (Manga: 299-302, Anime: 219)": "The world's greatest detectives were invited to an old mansion covered in blood in the isolated mountains of Matsumoto, a Nagano Prefecture's rural area at 2 kilometers from Okuno Dam.[2] The host told them that this huge mansion belonged to Renya Karasuma, who died half-a-century ago, at the age of 99, and that there is a treasure hidden inside.[3] That name triggers the guests attention, since he had tremendous influence throughout Japan. Conan solved the riddle, peeling off the entire outer walls of the black building and revealing solid gold underneath. Only Karasuma could do something on such a scale, and it must be worth a hundred billion yen. Kaitou Kid had come for Karasuma's treasure disguised as Kogoro, but it was too big for him to carry away and then flees from there. The victim and the culprit were possessed by Karasuma all along.\n",
    "Stradivarius Murder Case (Manga: 470, Anime: 385)": "Conan visualizes the boss as a big black figure behind Gin, Vodka, and Vermouth, with an evil aura to distinguish him from all the other minor criminals.\n",
    "Suspicious Cellphone Case (Manga: 479, Anime: 398)": "Conan visualizes the boss as a black figure behind Gin, Vodka, and a naked Vermouth in the anime version. It'd be a bad idea to send a message to that address, but Conan is calm, sure that he'll get his chance one day and he'll contact the boss.\n",
    "Missing Maria Higashio Case (Manga: 1008, Anime: 942)": "Yusaku and Subaru have reached the conclusion that \"ASACA\" and \"RUM\", the dying message left at the scene of Kohji Haneda's murder, is actually one single name: \"CARASUMA\". When Yusaku reveals it to his son and Agasa, Conan visualizes Karasuma as a shape before Gin, Vodka, a naked Vermouth, Chianti, and Korn, his crest and the pet crow on his left shoulder. That's why Shinichi's parents decided to stay in Japan and think of a plan, just what Conan wanted.\n",
    "TV Drama Filming Site Murder Case (Manga: 1025, Anime: 995)": "When Haibara reminds the drug her parents were forced to create by the organization, which shrunk Shinichi and Haibara's bodies, she visualizes Karasuma as a shape behind her parents, the pet crow on his left shoulder, and that drug.\n",
    "Trapped at Hatoyama Farm (Manga: 1051, Anime: 1053)": "When Rumi, talking with Sumiko about someone named \"Karasuda\" (crow field) as a crow, imagines that person all black and sly, a conspirator who's hard to get close to, but someone with such a name might well be a bright and cheery person instead, Conan visualizes Karasuma as a shape and the pet crow on his left shoulder, suspecting that she is a candidate for being the organization's second-in-command, Rum, and might personally know him.\n",
    "Yusaku Kudo's TV Show Case (Anime: 1072)": "Conan, Yusaku, and Akai visualize Karasuma as a shape behind Gin, Vodka, and Vermouth, and the pet crow on his left shoulder.\n",
    "Non-canon plot overview": "",
    "A criminal wasn't made in a day (Hanzawa the Criminal: 20, Anime: TBD)": "In an old-fashioned requiem shop, Hanzawa visualizes Karasuma as a shape, his crest and the pet crow on his left shoulder.\n",
    "Black Iron Submarine (Movie: 26)": "The Boss orders the Black Organization to kidnap Naomi in order to modify the All-Ages Recognition and delete their traces from past security camera footage around the world. After got texted by Vermouth about the possible threat caused by the AI system, he order to destroy it instead. He then appear as a shape in Rum's imagination, as he wonder about his whereabouts since he initially intended to use the AI system to locate him.\n",
    "Appellations": "\n",
    "Relationships analysis": "",
    "Black Organization": "Rum is the second-in-command in the organization, meaning that Karasuma must trust him the most, enough to make him the new highest ranking executive agent after his late father's long service. Rum has his support to do criminal activities, such as blackmailing big names in the political and financial world in order to strengthen their position. About forty-seven years ago, Rum appeared at the International Economic Forum's annual general meeting on behalf of him, who was absent due to poor health. However, Rum is scolded by the boss when his conspicuous actions can threaten the secrecy of the organization, for example by burning an island, instead of searching closely, to lure out their target. Even Rum has not seen him in a long time and has been trying to find out about his whereabouts.\nHe trusts Gin enough to make him the chief administrator in the organization, and for good reason: Gin is among the most loyal of the high-ranking members. Gin follows the boss' orders closely and virtually never acts against the organization's greater interests, and in return the boss entrusts Gin to direct critical missions and key assassinations. The boss often issues orders to Gin directly by text message for him to disseminate to the others, and the two are implied to contact each other fairly often about instructions and suspicions. He needs Gin to do the more criminal works, as other men are prevented from acting to that extent. Although Gin follows all orders from the boss, he acts on his own initiative on more than one occasion, as deciding to poison Shinichi with the recently approved APTX 4869 or to kill Vermouth if she does anything weird even if she is his favorite. For this reason, the FBI thought Gin would be able to lead them to the boss if they captured him.\nVodka is the managerial secretary in the organization. He is scared of consequence to act without the boss' permission, for example by killing Vermouth during a spy mission, but of course Gin takes full responsibility for his partner in the general oversight division.\nVermouth is known as Karasuma's favorite member by the other members although the reason for the favoritism is unknown, to the point of giving her limited independence and protecting her from other members who hate, mistrust, and wish to kill her. Bourbon reveals that there is some sort of connection between Vermouth and the boss, implying that her relationship with the boss goes further than merely being his favorite member. Bourbon also notes that he has arranged for her secret to be revealed to the whole organization in case something happens to him, and points out that the other members would be quite surprised if they knew the nature of the relationship. However, even then, he still willingly sends her into deadly missions. He has also unintentionally allowed Chris Vineyard to undermine the organization by protecting Conan, someone she thinks is especially dangerous. During a Halloween party, he discovered that Vermouth was up to something without the organization's knowledge, so he ordered Gin and Vodka to investigate. Aboard the ship, a man that Vermouth blackmailed to murder a director began screaming someone called Vermouth was to blame. Later on, he sends a text message to Vermouth's cellphone: \"It looks like I have given you too much freedom. Come back to my side, Vermouth.\" Conan tried to force Vermouth to surrender and take him to find the boss, but failed. Jodie hopes to capture Vermouth, who could lead the FBI to the elusive boss.\nChianti is scared of him even more than she proves to be scared of Gin and must work with Vermouth due to direct orders from the boss. In order to avenge Calvados' death, she would've killed Vermouth a long time ago, if she wasn't his favorite, but swears she'll definitely kill her in the end. She also proves to be envious for what Kir has used to make him let her join their group four years ago, but she and Kir have a cordial relation.\nHe promoted Kir because she had uncovered a spy and confronted him. The spy, Ethan Hondou, overpowered and tortured her for information, but Rena Mizunashi remained silent. Although completely crippled, Rena bit Ethan's wrist to force him to drop his gun, and then killed him. The bite marks and Ethan's recording device corroborated her story, so he promoted her to the codename Kir in recognition of her loyalty and sheer savagery. In truth, he was fooled. Ethan was Kir's father and they both are CIA spies infiltrating the organization. Hidemi Hondou had made a mistake and was about to be uncovered as a spy. Ethan, who had prepared appropriately ahead of time in case this happened, told Rena to tell the organization she discovered he was a spy and tried to confront him. Ethan then committed suicide after maiming himself and his daughter to prove that the story was true. He orders Kir to assassinate a politician while holding an interview. However, his assassinate plot was averted by the combined efforts of the FBI and Conan. The injured Kir was then captured by the FBI and was hospitalized in Haido Central Hospital for weeks. After the organization easily retrieved Kir from the FBI, Gin became suspicious of how ineffective the FBI's plan was and that Akai did not make a strong move. Gin thought that Akai is hiding something and relays his doubt to him, who also agrees. He and Gin plan a test of Kir's loyalty. Hearing about Camel became a suspect in a coincidental murder case, the organization takes advantage of the FBI's distraction, so Gin calls out Kir and tells her his order. In order to regain his trust, she is to call Akai out to meet with her and kill him. Kir meets with Akai at Raiha Pass and apparently kills him. However, he was fooled again. Conan, Akai, and Kir conspired to fake that death.\nBourbon is dispatched to search for the escaped scientist Sherry. However, Tooru Amuro received his permission to execute a second, secret mission: verified Akai's death by disguising himself as him and approaching his FBI colleagues. In truth, with the indirect support of the National Police Agency, Rei Furuya has been persevering to turn in Akai to the organization to earn higher ranks to get closer to the boss. Moreover, Bourbon is one of the few people who know his secret relationship with Vermouth.\nHe orders the execution of Shiho Miyano after she boycotted the development of APTX 4869 and rebelled against the organization. Naturally, when Sherry manages to escape before she could be even executed, he ordered the organization to hunt the traitor down and murder her, and to get rid of anyone associated with her. Conan later uncovers his phone number, but Ai Haibara warns him of the danger of calling it, likening it to Pandora's Box for his safety. Of course she knows all this from the start, the email address and the unbelievable person behind it, but this important secret is extremely dangerous, so Haibara has been hiding his true identity because she fears Conan will make a rash move and get himself killed.\nTwenty-five years ago, he wanted to buy the pharmaceutical company where Atsushi Miyano worked as part of a drug development team, but it went badly and that company was suddenly shut down. During the time Atsushi and his wife Elena were running their private clinic, they received invitations from him many times, but Atsushi had always refused his offer, considering the strange rumors surrounding that organization, discovered by his sister-in-law, Mary. However, nineteen years ago they went to his group's lab after all, so he sponsored their research to make APTX 4869.\nPisco is a big auto manufacturer chairman who had served under him for many years. He trusted Kenzo Masuyama enough to make him an executive agent of the organization. Gin relayed his orders to Pisco: silence a politician, who was going to be arrested for bribery, and use APTX 4869 if it was necessary. This conversation revealed his existence to Conan, which he had suspected from the beginning. Pisco successfully assassinated the target, but he was accidentally caught on a flash photo in the act of murder, showing him holding his gun in the newspaper. Then, fearing that Pisco may expose the existence and goals of the organization to the public, he ordered Gin to kill him and burn his house to the ground, which the latter does even though Pisco knew where Sherry was.\nFor assurance, Rikumichi Kusuda is sent to Haido Central Hospital to act as a patient while searching for Kir, who is currently held captive by the FBI. Kusuda continues to write to his e-mail address every day, until he was cornered by Akai and killed himself.\n",
    "Enemies": "Shinichi Kudo, the high school student and world's greatest detective, currently shrank into a little kid, Conan Edogawa, due to Gin and is the arch-enemy of Karasuma's criminal organization. From the beginning, as responsible for shrinking his body with their pill, Conan must manage to reach their mastermind and catch the organization in one fell swoop, all for the sake of returning to his original form. He is indirectly responsible for Shinichi's whole current life-threatening situation. An extremely dangerous man, far worse than everyone else in the organization, he is a diabolical presence that chilled the boy to the bone, which no other man in black or minor criminal can do. In fact, despite the two never actually confronting each other in person, every time he sees someone on a cell phone or sing Nanatsu no Ko, Conan gets flashbacks to Vermouth, from whom he got a vital clue, the email address that could lead him to the name and whereabouts of the supreme commander who controls them, and suddenly he looks pale and frightened. From now on, until his mission comes to a close, anyone associated with Conan, his parents or friends, is in a do-or-die situation.\nCapturing a high-ranking member of the organization who could lead the FBI to the boss was the goal of Shuichi Akai's spy mission. After three years of infiltration, he gave the undercover FBI agent Dai Moroboshi the codename \"Rye\" and ordered him to work under Gin. The FBI's plan to capture Gin fell apart when Akai's true allegiance was uncovered by Rum due to a mistake made by Camel. In the two years since the mission failure, he came to believe Akai could become the organization's silver bullet, the threat whom he fears the most, and is more like Vermouth than Gin.\n",
    "Name origin": "\"Karasuma\" literally means \"crow circle\", as the logo in his crest. It is a very unusual surname and most known for being a street (and its associated station and train line) in Kyoto. It can also be translated \"Karasumaru\", one of the old court nobles, or \"Ugan\", another name for the Wuhuan.\n\"Renya\" is a name also used for women, written with the kanji for \"lotus\" and \"father\".\n",
    "Character inspiration": "Gosho Aoyama was inspired by the fictional character James Moriarty, the main antagonist in the Sherlock Holmes' series, to create the Black Organization's head.[5] Just like the \"Napoleon of Crime\", he doesn't show his face and works as a shadow behind the scenes, only pulling the strings on the crimes from far away, sort of like Al Capone did.[6] He is depicted as a cold-blooded person who controls underworld and doesn't leave a single scrap of evidence, remaining anonymous to the public, and the shape similar to Professor Moriarty's in the novels.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The anime version's biblical painting in his former manor's dining room is a replica of The Queen of Sheba visits King Solomon, although with an inverted orientation. Since sunset also indicates an idea of glorious sun that goes out, he is almost like the wise but then corrupt King Solomon.\n- Due to his obese and aristocratic appearance, as well as his bird-like face, he bears a resemblance with the Penguin, the famous Batman villain, one of the author's favorite US comics.\n"
