    "Background": "Atsushi Miyano was a \"mad scientist\" who was unpopular in the scientific community because his work and theories were not mainstream.[5] Agasa was a distant acquaintance of Atsushi and had met him and his wife at conferences. Atsushi complimented Agasa on his inventions.[6] Atsushi Miyano's true appearance was unknown as he hadn't appeared in the manga until file 1011 in a flashback. He was shown in shadow in the anime. He moved out of his father's house in Kōenji[7] thirty years ago to go somewhere for his research; he had found someone to sponsor his theory, and was moving to join a large research facility.[8] Conan and Haibara think this is the Black Organization. He got married in this time period to Elena and then visited his father's house then occupied by his childhood friend and playmate Souhei Dejima later with Elena when Akemi was 4-5 years old. It was said that he seemed to have something important to discuss with his friend.[9] The visit occurred 20 years prior to the current timeline.[10] Rei Furuya said he met Atsushi some time before he died.[11]\n",
    "Personality": "Contrary to the personality generally associated with the phrase \"mad scientist\", Agasa describes Atsushi as having been \"a very polite man\" and that he doesn't think Atsushi was suspicious.[6]\n",
