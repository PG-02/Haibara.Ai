    "Background": "Hiroshi Agasa is an inventor and Shinichi's next-door neighbor. He makes his living with a wide number of patents and inventions, including video games (of which the Detective Boys are enthusiastic test players). While many of his inventions are useless or have even damaged his in-house research laboratory, Agasa has been successful enough to live in a large house and even rebuild it when necessary. He has been a friend of Shinichi and Ran since their childhood years.\nAfter Shinichi was shrunk by the APTX 4869, the first person he met and entrusted himself to was Agasa. After having been convinced that the little boy was Shinichi, Agasa was also the first one to advise Shinichi to exercise caution in his pursuit of the Black Organization. He also helped Shinichi in establishing his new identity as Conan Edogawa, including constructing several gadgets which help Shinichi in carrying on his detective work surreptitiously. In order to perfect Conan's cover, he also enrolled him in Teitan Elementary and thus came to know the children who would form the Detective Boys. When Shiho Miyano fled the clutches of the Black Organization, she fled to Shinichi's house but collapsed from exhaustion near Agasa's doorstep. Agasa subsequently took her in, learned about her true identity and helped her establish her new identity as Ai Haibara. He also entrusted Shinichi's parents with the secret about what has happened to their son.\nEver since these beginnings, Agasa has been an invaluable friend for Shinichi and the Detective Boys as a confidant, paternal friend, and someone to hang out with. He often takes the children on trips, most of which turn into criminal cases instead.\nAgasa owns a Volkswagen Beetle for at least 10 years, but it is quite unreliable and often breaks down in trips. At one point, he owns a Persian rug which can be sold for money to replace his Beetle, but since the rug was involved in a theft, the police is investigating and Agasa hasn't been able to sell it.\nBy knowing Shinichi and Shiho's identity, Agasa is aware of the existence of Black Organization as well as their crimes. While not confronting them directly, Agasa has been quite active in helping Shinichi and his allies planning against them. Agasa is entrusted by Shinichi when it comes to such cases.\n",
    "Childhood and relatives": "Agasa went to Teitan Elementary[4] and then Okuho middle school.[5] He met Fusae Kinoshita during sixth grade, though she moved away during the fall term and his family moved from Tokyo to the countryside soon after the term ended.[6]\nAgasa has a rich accountant uncle named Kurisuke Agasa who died 50 years before the present timeline at the age of 38.[7] The uncle liked gadgets. Kurisuke's sister, Teiko, was alive until a year ago when she passed away at age 76.[8] Agasa’s cousin’s granddaughter is of the right age to be introduced to Takagi.[9]\n",
    "Personality": "Hiroshi Agasa is a jovial, caring and outgoing person and has many friends in his community, a fact which helped him in his covering up of Conan's and Haibara's true origins (he simply claims that they are the children of his friends and acquaintances). Agasa is highly intelligent, having achieved at least one advanced degree and managing to invent a slew of useful gadgets. He is especially proud of his inventions, and their quality must have been recognized, since they have already been used during official events[10]. While a bachelor, he is very paternal and enjoys the company of the Detective Boys. Agasa has a special love for pasta and tomato juice.\n",
    "Appearance": "Agasa is an average size man with slightly-overweight frame. Looking somewhat older than his actual age, he is bald on the top of his head with the rest of his hair silver. He sports thick eyebrows and a mustache and a somewhat bulbous nose. He wears round glasses and is regularly seen in his lab attire\n",
    "Abilities": "",
    "Intelligence": "He is intelligent enough to invent many inventions.\n",

    "Non-canon plot overview": "",
    "Relationships analysis": "",
    "Shinichi Kudo/Conan Edogawa": "Conan treats Agasa like an uncle. Due to the fact that they both share the secret behind Shinichi's transformation and knowledge about the Black Organization, Conan often comes to him when in trouble or seeking for help. Agasa creates the necessary gadgets for Shinichi to play Conan's role and works hard to ensure this secret identity is safe, even from Shinichi's close friends like Ran and Sonoko. Agasa has also acted as mouthpiece for Conan when deducing crimes if Kogoro Mouri is not around or it's not safe to tranquilize him. Agasa has been supportive of Shinichi and Ran's relationship.\nIn private, Agasa calls Conan by his real name Shinichi. Sometimes he tends to slip and nearly exposes Shinichi's identity to public.\n",
    "Ran Mouri": "Since childhood, Ran and Shinichi would visit Agasa's house to play. While their relationship is not often showcased, Ran treats Agasa like an uncle or grandfather and trusts him with Conan. The professor seems to know when something is different and/or bothering Ran. Agasa has many times saved Ran, even using his body to block Ran from being shot. Seeing Agasa and the others getting hurt from being around her, she rans away to keep them safe. Agasa has been supportive of Shinichi and Ran's relationship and would often tease them both.\n",
    "Ai Haibara": "The relationship between Haibara and Professor Agasa is rather unusual, if not humorous. Despite what their actual (and apparent) ages are, Haibara often times acts more like a mother to the professor, constantly reminding him to watch what he eats. On several occasions, she has removed fattening foods from his reach[22], and is attempting to help get him into better shape[23]. There have also been instances where she'll instinctively step in front of Agasa to protect him from danger.[24] Out of all the people she's met, Haibara seems most comfortable about acting herself with Agasa; which might be attributed to the fact that he was the one who found her after she escaped the Black Organization, and took her in. Ai grows to love him like a real father and often tries to protect him above anyone else. Ai often hides behind Agasa.\nThough they only realized the fact some time later, Agasa knew her parents when they were still alive—especially her father, Atsushi Miyano—even though he didn't know at that time that they'd had children.[25][26]\nUnlike with Conan/Shinichi, both in public and in private, Agasa calls Haibara by her alias name Ai, even though he knows her real identity as Shiho Miyano.\n",
    "Yusaku Kudo": "Agasa and Yusaku are good friends.\n",
    "Juzo Megure": "Since Agasa's trips with Detective Boys often lead them to crime scenes, Agasa has met Megure frequently. Megure trusts and listens to Agasa's deduction (which actually comes from Conan using Voice Changing Bowtie, but Conan doesn't have to tranquilize Agasa). They are in good terms with each other, but at one point Megure remarks that Agasa has become a corpse magnet like Mouri.[27]\n",
    "Wataru Takagi": "For the same reasons, Takagi and Agasa meet frequently and are in good terms with each other.\n",
    "Shuichi Akai/Subaru Okiya": "In the story, Akai and Agasa meet for the first time after Akai fakes his death and becomes Subaru (Akai uses the Voice Changing Choker invented by Agasa to fake his voice as Subaru). Agasa eventually learns about Akai's secret identity and helps him with his disguise. On daily events, Subaru helps Agasa on his inventions or picking up the Detective Boys when he is not around.\nBoth in public and in private, Agasa calls Akai by his alias name Subaru.\n",
    "Fusae Campbell": "Fusae Campbell, today a successful fashion designer, was Agasa's first love in their childhood years. Because of her half-American heritage she has blonde hair, which made her the target of ridicule among her fellow students and thus very shy; she usually wore a large hat to conceal her hair. Three months after meeting Agasa, her family abruptly moved away, but she promised to return every ten years to a special place to meet him again. However, Agasa could not figure out what location she meant, until the Detective Boys and Conan find the original note she left behind and help him realize the answer to her clues. While they did not openly talk about their feelings during their brief reunion, there is a hint that their relationship is now beginning to grow.\n",
    "Character popularity": "- eBookJapan held a character popularity poll from April 12, 2011 to May 12, 2011 in which readers of Detective Conan (international included) could vote for their favorite character.

Agasa placed 37th overall.[29]\n",
    "Quizzes": "In the non-canon movies, Agasa usually gives a multiple-choice quiz to the Detective Boys as a reward or just to test their knowledge. These are mostly based on puns or rearranging the strokes in a character to get the answer.\n",
    "Name origin": "Agasa's name comes from mystery writer Agatha Christie. His first name Hiroshi is a pun as it is written with the same kanji for hakase (博士 ,professor?). Agasa's English given name \"Herschel\" likely comes from the physician friend of V. I. Warshawski, Dr. Charlotte “Lotty” Herschel.\nAdditionally, his great uncle and aunt, Kurisuke (栗介 ?) and Teiko (定子 ?), get their names from the Japanese pronunciation of Christie (クリスティ ,Kurisuti?) (Kurisuke obviously comes from Kurisu (クリス), but Teiko comes from Tei (テイ), and alternate writing for Ti (ティ)).\n",
