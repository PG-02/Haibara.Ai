    "Background": "Shuichi Akai is a British American of Japanese descent, originally from England, and is a member of the American Federal Bureau of Investigation, on special assignment in Japan to capture Gin. His superior is James Black and his partner is Jodie Starling.[2] He had infiltrated the Black Organization under the name Dai Moroboshi - and the codename \"Rye\" - as a mole[3] and dated Akemi Miyano, one of their low-ranking members, to feed information to the FBI. In order to facilitate the latter, and later because he had genuinely developed feelings for Akemi, Shuichi saw himself forced to break up his then on-going relationship with Jodie.[4] Later on, his cover in the Black Organization was accidentally blown by his colleague Andre Camel, and when Akemi was killed, he declared her murderer, Gin (with whom he seems to have had some tensions even before his exposure), his personal enemy.[5]\n",
    "The disappearance of his father": "17 years prior to the current timeline, Shuichi's father, Tsutomu Akai, got himself involved in the murder case of Kohji Haneda and Amanda Hughes and disappeared. In his last message he instructed his pregnant wife Mary and their two sons to hide in Japan. Shuichi, determined to investigate his missing father's \"incident,\" convinced his mother to let him study in America. After he left Japan, his younger sister Masumi was born. Shuichi didn't get to meet her until he returned to Japan after seven years in the states, but Shukichi sent him pictures of her. After he had finished school, he joined the FBI.\n",
    "Infiltration of the Black Organization": "Five years prior to the current time-line, FBI agent Shuichi Akai infiltrated the Black Organization using the alias Dai Moroboshi as a mole and dated Akemi Miyano, one of their low-ranking members, in order to meet Shiho Miyano, a high-ranked member codenamed Sherry, and use her influence to get into the Black Organization.[6] Although at first he was simply using Akemi as a tool, they both fell in love with each other. Shuichi distinguished himself as an agent and two years prior to the current time-line received the codename Rye and was called to work under executive agent Gin. The FBI laid a trap hoping to capture Gin at a warehouse where the meeting was supposed to take place,[6] but the Black Organization discovered Akai's true allegiance and Gin never appeared.[7]\nHe broke up with Akemi to protect her and he lost contact with her after the mission to capture Gin failed. Two years later Akemi got killed by the organization to cut loose ends.\n",
    "Personality": "Shuichi is a tenacious but stoic agent. Even in personal matters, he remains cool, even detached, from anyone, but his redeeming value is a great sense of loyalty to anyone he knows. He is a skilled and relentless pursuer and detective, qualities which have labeled him the number one enemy of the Black Organization and earned him the nickname \"Silver Bullet\". He looks forward to opportunities to hunt the Black Organization down and get revenge for Akemi. While usually professional, he often acts independently of the FBI, and even his boss James Black has trouble getting ahold of him. Shuichi gets along well with Conan, who share many personality traits. Despite that he has American citizenship, he still considers England as his home country.\nJames Black describes Shuichi as an introverted person who doesn't easily get close to people, and further notes that Shuichi has become even more closed off since Akemi's death.[8] Shuichi doesn't often voice what he is thinking and has an unhealthy tendency to prioritize his missions above the emotional well-being of his friends, co-workers, family, and love interests.[9] Conflict between his missions and the interests of those he cares about has lead to significant sorrow for him[10] and others.[11]\nShuichi prefers to plan secretly, and will readily trick his friends and coworkers, even injuring them, if helps the success of his missions.[12] Shuichi is often forgiven for these transgressions because his judgment is usually sound and his plans work out well.[13] Shuichi's secret plans, while strategically robust in the short term, often cause emotional problems for others that he does not fully appreciate.[14]\nEven though he means well, Shuichi is notably clumsy at trying to comfort and connect with others. He is especially dense at recognizing the motives behind the feelings of others and thus how to modify his own behavior to improve relations. As Subaru Okiya, his technique to approach Ai Haibara leaves her terrified of him, and repeated contact only intensifies her loathing. Ten years ago, he was also cold to young Masumi on their first meeting, brushing Masumi's silly antics aside without realizing that she simply wanted him to smile and treat her kindly, though he most likely was simply in a bad mood, since he just had an intense argument with his mother, in which they traded physical blows, because of his plan to join the FBI after his studies to pursue the case of his father and because he had lied to her about that. Later that day, during the investigation of a case, Shuichi gives both Shinichi and Ran a task to help with the investigation, so Masumi approaches Shuichi shyly and asks for a task as well. Now Shuichi responds kindly and gives her a task that makes her feel important.\nDespite his social awkwardness, Shuichi is not apathetic. He gives Jodie some hope by leaving her a message in his own handwriting, and leaves her a very roundabout hint about his identity after knocking her down even though he cannot reveal the truth to her yet. Eventually he also realized that Masumi was looking up to him, so he began to send her videos of him doing Jeet Kune Do.\n",
    "Appearance": "Shuichi is a tall and fit man of Japanese descent with short wavy hair with strands hanging over his right eye. He is very handsome, as mentioned by Yukiko Kudo. His trademark features, by which people close to him have identified him are his eyes which have permanent bags underneath them that make him appear sleep deprived. Other characters often describe him as evil eyed or having a sharp gaze. His eyes are blue in the manga (like every other character) and green in the anime. He and Masumi Sera presumably more closely resemble their mother then their father. The second trademark feature is his knit cap, which he is always shown wearing. When he was younger he had a grey fedora which Masumi now wears herself. Up to one year ago, he had very long waist length hair, which he cut after the death of Akemi Miyano \"to freshen up.\" Shuichi is left-handed. Ten years before the present timeline, Shuichi still had short hair, which means he grew it out sometime during the next five years.[15] He is a heavy smoker and his favorite drink is whiskey- he has recently taken to drinking bourbon rather than scotch.\nHis outfit is a grey jacket on top of a collared black shirt, black pants, shoes, and his trademark black knit cap.\n",
    "Abilities": "",
    "Intelligence": "Shuichi is a highly intelligent man, recognized as a threat even by Gin. Extremely observant and excellent instincts, he has a knack for seeing through deceptions and reading the patterns of people. Once, after realizing that a transmitter had accidentally been attached to the Black Organization, he set up a sniper ambush at a nearby building to Kogoro's detective agency, knowing that the enemies would try to kill Kogoro after finding the transmitter under the belief Kogoro was spying on them, all to trick the Organization into thinking the bug was his personal trap.\"[16] He is also very alert to threats on his person, able to sense Rei Furuya/Bourbon and his desire to kill Shuichi under the belief that Shuichi killed Scotch. Basically on par to Shinichi/Conan, Shuichi has a remarkable talent for analysis and deductive reasoning, able to survey the situation and accurately determine the cause of it. During Yusaku Kudo's Cold Case, Shuichi figured out the key point of Sanada coins, solving the case before Conan and even providing him the hint of \"Kumogakure Saizou\" to lead him to the same conclusion. In the Paper Airplane Case, Shuichi (disguised as Subaru Okiya), he also showed knowledge of Morse code and origami. He was able to deduce along with Yusaku Kudo that the hints of ASACA and MASCARA lead to the name of the Boss of the Black Organization, Karasuma Renya.\n",
    "Firearms": "Shuichi, is an exceptional crackshot with firearms, the most skilled seen so far. He can shoot a small piece of gum out of Gin's hand from about 700 yards away, even snipe at 1300 yards, well-beyond the range the Black Organization's professional snipers Chianti and Korn.[17] Shuichi is good at handling shotguns as well; he accurately shot Vermouth from the hip faster than she could aim at him with her subcompact pistol. He is capable of busting a moving car's tire from a speeding car with just a single shot.[18]\nWhile naturally left-handed, he is ambidextrous, able to wield firearms basically as effectively with his right hand. At the same time Akai is unusual in that he is \"eye-bidextrous\" while shooting. Like hands and feet, most individuals have a dominant eye they prefer to use when lining up a shot, but Shuichi is shown using both eyes at different times.[19]\n",
    "Martial arts": "Shuichi is also a highly proficient hand-to-hand combatant. Having extensive skill and knowledge of Jeet Kune Do, he taught his sister Sera much, who openly acknowledges him to still be much stronger than her.[20] In the Bus Jack case, Shuichi's combat skills was hinted as he was ready to strike one of the criminals before Conan hit him with the tranquilizer dart. During the Ikkaku Rock case, Shuichi expertly knocks a knife out of the criminal's hand unarmed. Though subtle, Shuichi also swiftly knocks out a drunkard harassing Officer Yumi (at the request of his younger brother) in the Policewomen Serial Murder Case. At the same time, he is noticeable resilient. While taking a serious kick to the face from Ran Mouri, he emerged virtually unharmed, a feat few people have accomplished against her.\n",
    "Other skills": "Shuichi is a skilled driver. He can overtake many cars quickly in heavy traffic conditions and drift around a U-turn.[21] As Subaru, he hacked into Kogoro's computer to see what cases he had received from his website. Later he hacked into Haibara's Phone and saw the message that Vermouth had sent her. Shuichi learned how to act and properly apply his Subaru disguise by himself thanks to Yukiko Kudo and equipment from Professor Agasa.[22]\nHe also learned from Yukiko to be a very capable cook. This was meant to help better keep a low-profile as Subaru.[23] At the same time, he would often uses his dishes as an excuse to interject himself into cases at Professor Agasa's house and save money on food. He apparently at one point held a part-time job playing the accordion, making decent money from it. In addition to his native language, having worked in the United States as an FBI agent for a long time, Shuichi is also fluent in English as shown in the episode 288.\n",

    "Relationships analysis": "",
    "Family and friends": "Shuichi Akai and Akemi Miyano were lovers while he was infiltrating the Black Organization. Shuichi's original mission was to date Akemi Miyano in order to meet Shiho Miyano. Shuichi used Shiho's influence to gain rank in the Organization, intending to become trusted enough to meet with high level agents so the FBI could capture one for questioning. As James Black later recalls, although Shuichi's relationship with Akemi was merely a stepping stone, Shuichi actually fell in love with Akemi, and considered her his real girlfriend. Because of this he broke up with Jodie Starling.\nHow Akemi and Shuichi met in the manga is unknown, but in the anime, Shuichi Akai originally met Akemi by an intentional accident. She accidentally hit him with her car when he deliberately walked into the street in front of her in order to be hit by her.[40] Akemi was concerned, and helped take him to the hospital, watching over him until he was better. When he woke up, he felt no anger over what she did, and even asked for her name, to which a very flustered Akemi replied, while he told her his fake name: Dai Moroboshi. After this they began dating.\nSometime later, Akemi develops the suspicion that Shuichi really wasn't who he claimed to be. After Shuichi's expulsion, he confirms that he is an FBI agent to her. To Shuichi's surprise, Akemi doesn't seemed surprised by this, so Shuichi asks her why she never said anything about her suspicions that she was being used by him before, and Akemi hints it is because she loves him. Initially, the Organization couldn't do anything about Akemi because they needed the loyalty of her sister, but two years later they decided that the risk of her contact with Shuichi was too much. They decided to create a situation where they could eliminate her by having her do a bank heist she was supposed to fail. Sometime near the day of the heist, Akemi sent Shuichi a long text message, asking him if he wants to be her real boyfriend when she is finally free from the Organization. After the heist, Akemi is killed by Gin, and it is unknown how Shuichi responded if at all. Shuichi treasures her final text message, and keeps it in his phone many months after Akemi's death. The message also contains a P.S. which has not been revealed yet.\nUntil now, Shuichi probably still doesn't know that Akemi is actually his cousin.[41]\nWhile Jodie and Shuichi's relationship had been viewed as mere colleagues, it is revealed later on in the series that Jodie and Shuichi had dated before about 5 years prior. However, after Shuichi infiltrated the Black Organization under the alias of Dai Moroboshi, he started dating Akemi Miyano in hopes of using her to attain information about the Black Organization. Despite this, Shuichi ended up falling in love with Akemi, leading him to break up with Jodie, stating that, \"To be able to love two women at the same time…it's not that handy a personality.\"[42] In spite of the break-up, Jodie still held strong feelings for Shuichi which never wavered as time passed and took his apparent death at Kir's hands especially hard, to the point of being reduced to tears. According to Super Digest Book plus 100 Akai-san and Jodie-sensei’s first impressions of each other were, Jodie’s was “What an arrogant man...”, Akai’s was “What a nagging woman”.\nJames Black is the boss of the FBI agents in Japan and therefore the boss of Shuichi. He was one of those who know that Shuichi was alive after Shuichi's fake death, but only because he saw the glue on Shuichi's fingers and would have otherwise also been kept in the dark. The two maintain close contact with each other up to present.\nAndre Camel worked with Shuichi Akai before when he was an agent in the Black Organization. Camel was involved in the plan to capture Gin two years ago, but he gave away the plan of the FBI when he saw a member of the organization disguised as an old man. Because of this, Shuichi's identity became known to the Organization. However, Shuichi does not seem to bear a grudge against Camel but worked together well. Camel is willing to help Akai in any way he can to redeem for his mistake.\nWhen Haibara first met Shuichi, she thought he was a member of the Black Organization. Shuichi seems to know of Haibara's identity. Haibara knows him as Dai Moroboshi, her sister's boyfriend who betrayed the Organization.[43] Haibara should know Dai was a spy and FBI agent, after hearing an exchange between Bourbon and Kaitou Kid through a microphone[44], but she does not know him by the name Shuichi Akai. During his time in the organization he became acquatained with Haibara, while she was still known as Shiho Miyano, through Akemi and make use of it to slip into the organization. He made a promise with Akemi to look after Haibara's welfare.[45]\nShuichi and Conan get along well and are capable of thinking on par with one another. In the short time they have worked together, Shuichi has come to respect Conan's intellect and deductive skills and speaks to him professionally. After FBI had capture Kir, he asked who Conan was, hinting that he suspected that there was more to Conan that meets the eyes. He is also aware that Conan and Shinichi Kudo are really one and the same person[46]. There is further speculation amongst fans that Shuichi has figured out that Ai was formerly Sherry and (more than likely) learned about her research for the Black Organization and the two possible effects of APTX 4869.\nMasumi Sera is Shuichi's younger sister. Masumi wasn't born yet when Shuichi went to America to study, so they first got to meet each other, when Masumi was seven. It's indicated at Shuichi cares for his sister. While Masumi was growing up, Shuichi would send her training tapes of Jeet Kune Do that she could practice after. During the Mystery Train case, when Masumi was knocked out by Vermouth and hidden in her room, Shuichi (disguised as Subaru) carried her back to her own room. As he was about to leave he overheard her calling out 'Shuu-nii' in her sleep, which made him smile. In the movie Dimensional Sniper he (as Subaru) was seen leaving the hospital, where Masumi was hospitalized after getting shot, hinting that he was visiting her. While she was unconscious, he left a bouquet in her room, which Ran and Sonoko find. During the Antique Facet Case, when he realize Masumi showing suspicious movements around Agasa's house, he shows up as Subaru and keep an eye on her. He realize that Masumi was trying to pressure Haibara. He ended up by interrupting her investigation to prevent Masumi get involved into dangerous situation.\nShukichi Haneda is Shuichi's younger brother. He keeps track of Shukichi Haneda's shogi matches. During a reunion ten years ago Shukichi shows concern over his choice of path in life. During the Policewomen Serial Murder Case, he received a text by Shukichi to protect Yumi Miyamoto, indicating the brothers are in contact. When Yumi is accosted by drunkards, he disguised as Subaru incapacitates them and has them leave her alone.\nMary Sera is Shuichi's mother. She hoped that he would become a father figure to Masumi to replace their missing biological father.\nTsutomu Akai is Shuichi's father. His father's disappearance cause him to seek revenge and is the reason Shuichi became an FBI agent.\nIn File 1049, the flashback conversations between Vermouth and Mary confirmed that Mary and Elena are sisters. So that Shuichi is blood relatives with Miyano family.\n",
    "Allies": "Hidemi is a CIA agent undercover in the Black Organization as Rena Mizunashi, codenamed Kir. She agreed to supply the FBI with information of the organization in return for her brother's protection. She, Akai and Conan worked out the plan to send Hidemi back to the organization and fake Akai's death.\n",
    "Black Organization": "Shuichi Akai and Gin are rivals and hate one another. It is implied that they didn't get along even before Shuichi was exposed as an undercover FBI agent. Shuichi refers to Gin as \"Koibito\", which ironically means 'lover.' Gin killed Shuichi's love Akemi, so Shuichi thinks of Gin as his archenemy.\nSince joining the Black Organization, Rei Furuya has always considered Shuichi as a worthy rival, he wants to compare his capacity with Shuichi and thinks he is the only one who could defeat Shuichi. Shuichi always shows respect towards Rei, he admits Rei's capability and feels interest everytime he faces Rei, he also makes Rei feel quite confused sometimes. Their relationship is becoming more bitter and dramatic when Rei misunderstood Shuichi killed his best friend - Scotch, but actually the one who indirectly caused Scotch to die was Rei himself. Shuichi chooses to keep a secret, continues to let Rei misunderstand him instead of letting Rei know that painful truth. Over time, Shuichi appears to help and protect Rei in some cases, he gradually wants to compensate for the losses which Rei has experienced, he also reveals that he doesn't want to be Rei's enemy. For now, Rei is temporarily lowering his hatred to working well with Shuichi and Conan in destroying the Black Organization.\n",
