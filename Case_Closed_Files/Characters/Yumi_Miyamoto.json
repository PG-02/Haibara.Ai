    "Background": "Yumi is a traffic cop who mostly focuses on traffic accidents and hit-and-runs. She often runs into the Detective Boys and Conan when they are in the middle of solving a case, and has helped them numerous times in solving cases and catching criminals.\nYumi's best friend is Miwako Sato, whom she often teased about her feelings for Wataru Takagi. She often went to the both of them and gave them both advice on how to tell each other how they felt, which was sometimes successful; but other times, the plans failed due to Takagi and Sato's shyness around each other. With Takagi and Sato finally having confessed their feelings to each other, and with their greatest competitor, Shiratori, having found his match as well, she was left at a loss at whom to tease.\nDuring her college days, she met Shukichi Haneda on a train and they began dating. Yumi decided to break up as she would become a police officer and, in response, he gave her an envelope, telling her to open it only after he had \"collected all seven\" without further explanation. Since he did not contact her afterwards, she got tired of waiting and considered them broken up. However, their relationship was rekindled when Shukichi - with assistance from the Detective Boys - rescued her from a kidnapper.[2] Some time afterwards, she would dumbfoundedly learn that Shukichi was actually a famous shogi player, and the \"seven\" he wanted to collect were the seven grand titles of a shogi master.\n",

This allows her to take advantage of the men in the district, having them buy gifts for her to try and impress her. She likes to be the center of attention; it is for this reason that she dumped her then-boyfriend, Shukichi Haneda, when he became obsessed to win of all seven shogi grandmaster titles in order to prove himself worthy of her, but without telling her of either his profession or his actual goal.[3] She is also jealous of Sato and others for having relationships while she remains single, and did everything she could to keep Chiba and Naeko from spending too much time alone when she noticed how well they were getting along.\nYumi owns two dogs named Suta and Hachi, and is allergic to cats.[4]\nYumi likes mahjong and is often sleepy at work from playing all night.\n",
