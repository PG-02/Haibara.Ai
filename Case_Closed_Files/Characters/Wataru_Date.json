    "Background": "Wataru Date was an officer from Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department under the Criminal Investigation First Division. He was later assigned to be the mentor of Wataru Takagi,[2] and together they became known as the \"Wataru Brothers.\"[3] He was dating an English teacher, Natalie Kuruma. Unfortunately, he got caught up in a car accident after one of his stakeouts with Takagi and died one year ago.[2] A year later after his death, it was discovered that Date was an acquaintance of Rei Furuya, whom he had met while attending a police academy.[4] He also knew Jinpei Matsuda, Hagiwara and Hiromitsu Morofushi from the academy. Before his death, he received a package meant to be passed on to Hiromitsu's older brother Taka'aki, but it was left untouched in his locker for over a year.\nHis father was a policeman and always had a toothpick in his mouth. One day when his father was off-duty, he and his father enters a store only to find a thug demanding money. His father noticed that the thug had friends and begged the robber to spare them, but the thug hit him numerous times before they got away. In the end, his father quit the police force. Wataru didn't know the truth and thought his father begged for his life for no necessary reason, so he decided to become a police officer. At the police academy, he learned the truth and decided to become like his father. Since then, he started to put a toothpick in his mouth.\nHe attended police academy with Rei Furuya, Jinpei Matsuda, Hiromitsu Morofushi, and Kenji Hagiwara. He was the leader of the squad and held second place at the academy. All five friends graduated together.\n",

    "Wataru Takagi": "Date was Takagi's mentor and close friend. He passed away in a traffic accident. As the pronunciation of his name was the same as Wataru Takagi's, Date said they were \"Wataru brothers\" (ワタル・ブラザーズ ,Wataru Burazāzu?). Just before his death, he entrusted Takagi a ring for Natalie Kuruma, but Takagi never got to give the ring to Natalie, because he was still affected by Date's death and Natalie committed suicide soon after. When Takagi realized that Date's girlfriend was Natalie he took contact with the one, who claimed her personal things to inform them the truth, most likely out of duty to his late friend.\n",
    "Rei Furuya": "Date and Rei Furuya were friends in the police academy; Rei was the top-ranked student, while Date held second place. He protected Rei whenever Rei was mistaken as biracial or a foreigner. While Date went on to become an officer, Rei went somewhere else and fell out of contact with Date for unknown reasons. Date's last text to Rei asked him where he was and chided Rei to communicate once in a while. Rei was shown visiting Date's grave, and likely left a toothpick out of respect for Date; Date used them habitually.\n",
    "Natalie Kuruma": "Natalie was his girlfriend. After hearing Date died in a car accident, Natalie committed suicide out of despair. Due to Date's surname could be mistaken for the English word 'Date', since her mother was American, she would call him 'Wataru' when she told her parents about him. Date probably intended to propose to her after they had met each other's parents. A year later, her death was misunderstood as Wataru Date was the cause of her choice to suicide. It resulted in a trap, where Takagi almost got killed by Ryusaku Fuemoto, her ex-English teacher, mistaken as the 'Wataru' Natalie always told about.\n",
    "Jinpei Matsuda": "Jinpei Matsuda attended the same police academy as Date. They also graduated together.\n",
    "Kenji Hagiwara": "Kenji Hagiwara attended the same police academy as Date. They also graduated together.\n",
    "Hiromitsu Morofushi": "Date was well acquainted with Hiromitsu Morofushi since they were good friends along with the three others and attended the academy together.\n",
    "Name origin": "Wataru Date shares his first name with police sergeant Wataru Takagi, which prompted him to make a nickname for the both of them: \"Wataru Brothers.\" However, the kanji that represented his first name was different to that of Takagi's. His name is written with the kanji 航, which has the ON-reading of kō (コウ ?). Meanwhile, Takagi's is written with the kanji 渉, which has the ON-reading of shō (ショウ ?).[3] This similarity in first name became an important factor in the Overnight Deadline case. Date's last name played an important role in the said case as well.[6].\nSimilarly to the other suspects in his introductory case, his first name also comes from transports, as the \"航\" is similar to ships (船 ,funa?)[7]. As the case he appears first in happens in Hokkaido, his last name \"Date\" is also that of a city with the same name in the prefecture.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Gosho Aoyama revealed in a postcard response to a fan that Wataru Date is not Scotch.[8]\n- According to Gosho in JUSTICE PLUS Super Digest Book, the reason why Hiromitsu's smartphone ended up being left in Date's locker was because Date had that car accident just as he thought about sending it.\n"
