    "Background": "Shiratori's debut was in the first movie, The Time-Bombed Skyscraper, acting as a member of Megure's police force.[3] At first, Shiratori appeared in two movie roles, before becoming a full-fledged inspector when he was introduced into the manga a month after his second movie appearance.[4]\nAs a child, Shiratori studied diligently to one day become a lawyer, and had even memorized some laws by heart. One day, he witnessed a young girl confronting two juveniles trying to steal mangas from a bookstore. When the two offenders had pushed the girl to the floor for her protests, and seemed about to hurt her, Shiratori had stepped forward to recite the provisions made in the Japanese Law to punish stealing. This somewhat unnerved the juveniles and attracted the attention of the store owner and the other customers, causing the offenders to hastily get away. To thank him for helping her out, the girl bought him a drink and made a sakura petal pattern from the straw wrapper, saying that the sakura was the symbol of courage for the Japanese police (due to the distinct form of the Japanese police badge), and Shiratori had acted with courage just like them. It was because of this incident that Shiratori decided to become a cop rather than a lawyer, and also started to consider the girl to be his childhood love.[5]\nShiratori later joined the Tokyo Metropolian Police Department and worked alongside Inspector Megure, often acting as an extra officer or pair of eyes, though he later became an inspector of his own. When Miwako Sato joined the department, Shiratori believed that he had found his childhood love again, and as a result both he and his younger colleague Takagi considered each other rivals for Sato's affections. Shiratori would often try to show off in front of Takagi by asking Sato on a date, but she always rejected him, much to his dismay. However, he has since come to date Sumiko Kobayashi, a teacher at Teitan Elementary School (where Conan, along with the other Detective Boys, studies), whom he finally discovered to be his true love.\n",
    "Personality": "Shiratori comes from a wealthy family. Because of his background, Shiratori acts much more conceited than his one-time rival for Miwako Sato's affections, Wataru Takagi. His favorite hobbies include studying architecture, cooking, and collecting wine, including his favorite Romane Conti. Shiratori tends to do well in cases when faced with topics pertinent to his upper class tastes,[6] especially in cases involving wine.[7] When he was introduced in the first movie, Conan treated him as a suspect and Kogoro Mouri accused him of being the bomber because of his knowledge of skyscrapers and buildings.\nAs a police officer, Shiratori is fairly average, on par with Sato or Megure. He is calmer on the case than Takagi or Sato. Shiratori, like Sato and Takagi, believes that Conan has a lot of intelligence for a boy his age, but unlike Takagi and Sato, he usually tends not to care much for Conan's opinion. He often feels that Conan gets in the way, though Conan always proves otherwise. However, unlike Kogoro, Shiratori will take notice and suspect something if Conan points something quite interesting. In his initial manga appearances, Shiratori was incredibly cocky when battling for Sato's affections, but has since become more modest with his girlfriend Sumiko at his side.\nIn pursuit of love, Shiratori has a one track mind and is willing to abuse his police powers to achieve his desire. He even became the leader of a secret police group which protected Miwako Sato from the affections of other police officers like Takagi. Shiratori fixated on Sato because he believed she was the childhood crush who completely changed his life at a chance meeting in a bookstore. Shiratori is crushed when Sato chooses Takagi in the end, and can't truly give up his feelings for her. He later discovers that Sumiko Kobayashi is the true girl from his childhood memories. Once the realization sets in, Shiratori's Sato complex dissolves and he develops an affection for Sumiko that soon blossoms into mutual love. Meeting Sumiko has also helped cure his arrogance to a large degree. Shiratori more than once tried to use his riches to get an edge over Takagi over Sato in the past, but now that he's with Kobayashi he does it solely to make her happy. He's noticeably more friendly towards Conan, Ai and the Detective Boys as time passes.\n",

There, he meets the Detective Boys, and when the conversation shifts towards Shiratori's feelings towards Sato, he narrates an incident from his early life.\nOnce, when Shiratori was in primary school, he had seen a girl of roughly the same age as him accuse two teenage boys of stealing mangas from the book store they were in. When the girl was pushed to the floor by them, Shiratori had stepped in to protect her and prevent the theft, by reciting the provisions of the Japanese Law against stealing, thus unnerving them and attracting the attention of the store owner. Later, the girl had brought Shiratori a cup of cola decorated with a sakura petal design (made of straw wrappers) out of gratitude, saying that the sakura was the symbol of the Japanese Police (due to the shape of their badge) and the \"flower of justice\".\nFrom that day, he considers the girl his first love and 'girl of destiny', and due to her uncanny resemblance to Sato, he believes her to be the same person.\nAt the cinema hall, Shiratori and the Detective Boys meet a woman named Nami Kasakura, who also makes sakura designs, and Shiratori thinks that she might actually be that girl. Later, however, Shiratori himself has to reluctantly prove that she is the murderer of her boyfriend, leaving him devastated. To lift his spirits, Ayumi gifts him a wrapper-made sakura bracelet, and makes the same statement as the 'girl of destiny' about the Japanese Police. As Shiratori frantically asks her who taught her that, and Ayumi says it was their teacher, Sumiko Kobayashi, Sumiko appears to take the children home. Shiratori grabs Sumiko's hand romantically, and offers to give all of them a ride home, causing her to blush.\n",

    "List of disguises used": "",
    "Relationships analysis": "",
    "Family and friends": "Shiratori used to show affection for Miwako Sato, whom he believed to be his first love interest from his childhood days. He would often ask her out on dinner dates but always end up being turned down, much to his dismay.[4] He also knows that Takagi also has feelings for Sato, and often will put down Takagi while in front of her, by showing off how he is wealthy and wants to take her to fancy dinner dates.[4] However, Sato does not feel the same way for him, and always turns him down. In later episodes, Shiratori is the leader of a police force that is mostly hellbent on getting Takagi and Sato to break up, especially when Sato and Takagi begin to move further in their relationship. Shiratori once even tries to sabotage a date at Tropical Land that Sato and Takagi are having, have the police lie to Megure that they are working, so that they can secretly pretend to be staff members of Tropical Land, and try to ruin the date.\nIn another situation, Shiratori almost marries Sato, through an arranged marriage set up by Shiratori's family and Sato's mother. However, thanks to an ultimatum set up by Sato, Takagi is about to stop the marriage, with the help of Conan and Dr. Araide, before Sato and Shiratori can kiss.\nShiratori's strong infatuation for Sato came from a childhood memory of his first love who looked remarkably like her. However, after solving a case with the Detective Boys, he meets his actual true love: Sumiko Kobayashi. Since then, Shiratori has become a friend towards Sato and fully supports her relationship with Wataru Takagi.\nAfter learning that Sumiko is his first love[5], through an investigation with the Detective Boys where he himself solved the crime, Shiratori has been frequently phoning her and visiting her at the elementary school under the guise of warning her of dangerous activity in the area.[15] He has also resigned from his \"position\" as Chief Executive of Miwako Sato's Line of Defense, telling the other officers to let Takagi and Sato be.[16]\nDuring the investigation of the Loan Shark Murder Case, Sumiko is brought to the police station as a witness and learns that she resembles Sato, and that Shiratori used to be in love with her (Sato).[17] This upsets her, thinking that Shiratori is affectionate of her only because she resembles Sato, and she behaves coldly and harshly towards Shiratori, even claiming to not remember their first meeting[5] when he tries to confess his feelings to her (she remembers the incident, but perhaps she doesn't believe that Shiratori is the same person), saying that it must have been Sato he met instead.[18] However, after saving her from the culprit, Shiratori recites the provisions of the Japanese Law - just like he had done in the book store years ago - to quash the murderer's justification of his actions, causing Sumiko to remember him as the same person. Finally, Shiratori confesses his true feelings to Sumiko, and the two of them begin dating. Sumiko would frequently present home-made bentos to Shiratori.[19]\nMegure and Shiratori share a fairly close relationship, and the later is frequently seen assisting Megure in investigations. The bond between them is evident in Movie 2:The Fourteenth Target, where Shiratori helps an injured Megure in swimming and escaping the flood, after the underwater restaurant they were in, is made to collapse by the murderer.\nShiratori saw Takagi as a love rival and tried to be better than Takagi and win Sato's heart, but failed. He become leader of a group of police who were against Takagi and Sato together. When he found out the Sumiko is the girl he loves, he told officers to let them be and supports their relationship.\n",
    "Character popularity": "eBookJapan held a character popularity poll from April 12, 2011 to May 12, 2011 in which readers of Detective Conan (international included) could vote for their favorite character. Shiratori placed 22nd in the poll with 22 votes out of the 5,883 that were cast.[20]\n",
    "Name origin": "- His name comes from \"Ninzaburo\" Furuhata, a fictional police detective from a drama of the same name, and Keisuke \"Shiratori\", a character created by Takeru Kaido as a medical analyst who solves the cases of dead people after professionnal failures.\n",
    "Different looks": "",
    "Quotes": "— Shiratori, confessing his love for Kobayashi-sensei.\n— Shiratori teaching a murderer about the law and unknowingly causing Kobayashi-sensei to remember him.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Unlike many of the characters, Shiratori strongly believes in destiny or fate.\n- His background story was changed slightly when he became a regular character. When he was introduced in The Time-Bombed Skyscraper for the first time, he was said to be new to the force. However after Shiratori was incorporated into the manga, it was later said that he'd been on the force since at least three years prior, and longer than Takagi.\n- Originally, he was created for the movies, but became a permanent character in the manga and anime. The plot of the first movie was intended as a story arc for Magic Kaito for a while. Gosho Aoyama said that he already wrote the plot back in school, and considered it for Yaiba once, but it didn't fit the kind of story it was, and then for Magic Kaito, but there wasn't any opportunity to integrate it. When he got told that Detective Conan was getting a movie adaptation, he proposed the plot for this project, but says that he regrets it by now, since Teiji Moriya, the main antagonist, was based on James Moriarty and he would have preferred to tell a story like that in the manga. Because of this, he was originally designed as a character for Magic Kaito before transitioning him to Detective Conan together with the plot he debuted in.\n- According to OVA 2, Shiratori owns a big villa in Karuizawa.\n- His family background was changed for the English dubbed version of movie 2: The Fourteenth Target in order to give him a connection to the number 3 and hence put him on 3rd position of the murderer's hit-list. In the dub, Shiratori is the youngest of three brothers, each of whom were born at a separation of three years. In the original Japanese version, those brothers do not exist and Shiratori represents number 3 because the middle kanji of his first name, Ninzaburo, is the kanji for the number three (任三郎 ).\n- Shiratori, who normally appears about once every ten cases or so, once had an unusually large gap between appearances. The bounds of this gap are File 808: The Late Grave Visit to File 942: Chiba's Difficult Case  (134 files) in the manga, and Episode 683: The Life-Threatening Broadcast of Love to Episode 804: Conan and Ebizo's Kabuki Jūhachiban Mystery (121 episodes) in the anime.\n- \"Shiratori\" (白鳥) literally means \"white bird\".\n- According to RECIPE PLUS Super Digest Book the side dish that Inspector Shiratori likes in Kobayashi-sensei's homemade lunchboxes are Octopus sausages.\n"
