    "Background": "Rum is the second-in-command of the Black Organization and the close aide of Renya Karasuma. He inherited that codename from his father, who had served Karasuma for many years. About sixty-seven years ago, he was only a child. He was involved in the United States' murder case of Amanda Hughes and Kohji Haneda seventeen years ago. He changes his voice with a machine when he communicates with his subordinates. Currently disguised as Kanenori Wakita, he is a drifter arranged as sushi chef at Beika Iroha Sushi, the local restaurant which is just next door to Mouri detective agency and one of Kogoro's favourite hangout places, since the regular waiter was in an accident. He becomes Kogoro's second apprentice in order to get closer to him and extract information. He is interested in Shinichi and instructed Bourbon to gather information about Shinichi. He also considers Yusaku a threat to the organization and instructed Vermouth to investigate him.\n",
    "Personality": "Bourbon describes Rum as exceedingly impatient. He is also a rude and intuitive person, taking an interest and investigating anyone that he deems suspicious and a threat to the organization or even to himself: e.g. he ordered to kill Rumi only because of his suspicious. He is a cigar smoker and has always wanted to try show at least once. As Kanenori Wakita, he is a true edokko (\"child of Tokyo\"), hated betrayal and has the stereotypical personality: forward, confrontational, and fond of justice and sushi. He compares traitors to cheating fish-sellers. In contrast to his Kanenori's role, Rum's manner of speaking is more polite and formal.\n",
    "Appearance": "Rum is an older bald man with a strong build, a fairly tall, fair skin tone, black eyes and white facial hair. He has damaged his left eye and replaced it with an artificial one. Just like Kuroda's, his artificial prosthetic eye is completely white. Prior to loss, his eye had a vertically slit-shaped pupil, like those seen in a snake. As Kanenori Wakita, he has a short black hair, a toothbrush mustache, prominent buck teeth, and soft medical gauze dressing over his left eye. He is right-handed. There are conflicting accounts of his overall appearance and build among the organization members, but he fabricated them to keep his identity a secret. Some think Rum is a strongly-built man, some say he looks feminine, and some say he is an old man. Seventeen years ago, Rum wore a black jacket with a fur collar, a striped shirt, a black hat, and a monocle over his left eye, which was attached to a chain under his jacket. In the present, he wears no monocle and hat, his black jacket has a regular collar, a shirt with a multicolored patchwork design, and a collar pin.\n",
    "Abilities": "He has a keen sense of observation and relatively good deduction skills just like Conan, liking mystery since he was a child. He was also able to brainwash Curaçao and appoint her as his right-hand agent. He can quickly figure out tactical traps that are being used against him, allowing him to execute a strategic counterattack and utilize the situation to his advantage. He has skills in culinary arts, but can't safely wield the knife due to his injured eye. In conclusion, he is more intelligent than Gin and a master of disguise like Vermouth. He can speak English, which indicates that he's well educated. His left eye possessed something similar to photographic memory, that allows him to remember people's gestures and habits, to which he used the information gathered to blackmail big names in the political and financial world in order to make the organization grow bigger. He has had such eyes since he was young.\n",

He also deduces it is very out of character for Kogoro. Conan, worried about Rum, wants to know what happened to his eye. He turns out to be a fan of the famous Sleeping Kogoro and wants to know about his cases. Kogoro tells him about the recent zombie murder, leaving out certain embarrassing details. A pickpocketing case then coincidentally falls into their laps. He challenges Kogoro to a deduction contest: a race to figure out which customer stole the lady's million yen winning ticket first. He cleverly and decisively comes up with excuses to keep all the suspects from leaving the sushi bar when they try to leave to avoid being accused. Although disappointed he won't get to see Kogoro in action, he is also first to propose a solution, which is very nearly close to correct, although he might have made his error in order to test Sleeping Kogoro in action. However, since he was mistaken, Conan darts Kogoro to put the case to rest decisively. He is impressed and asks to be Kogoro's disciple in exchange for discounts on sushi. Kogoro accepts, but it isn't clear if the response was serious.\n",

After he finished his conversation, he is seen reading an article in his phone, where the blogger who claimed that she saw Shinichi was nothing but an illusion, calming down the uproar about Shinichi. Rum sends an email to Bourbon, asking him to gather information about Shinichi, telling him to hurry up stating that \"Time is money\".\n",
    "Nagano Snowy Mountains Case (Manga: 1027-1031, Anime: 1003-1005)": "Kanenori joins Conan, Kogoro, and Amuro to Nagano mountains after receiving a request about investigating a suicide case in an old church.

However, Rum was able to detect such fake code due to the difference in romaji writing. His subordinates were then able to counter trap and attacked the FBI members instead. Although the collaborative efforts of Akai and Conan managed to keep Camel hidden for a while, Rum figured out their strategy and instructed Gin to burn Umizarujima, successfully luring out him into the open. However, they were fooled into thinking to have successfully eliminated the FBI agent. Two years ago, when Rye's allegiance to the FBI was exposed, Rum sent a picture of Akai and Camel to Korn, ordering him to assassinate the FBI agents once in sight. After the case, Rum was scolded by the boss, stating that their actions at Umizarujima stood out a bit more than they should have been. Despite receiving an earful, the boss was pleased with the recent turn of events, commending Rum and the others for successfully killing the man that the FBI desperately protected.

He shows to know Akemi attended this school nineteen years ago, but muses to himself that a dead person would be unable to attend their reunion. His indirect presence heavily triggered Haibara's anxiety, causing Conan to rush outside the classroom. When he asked an upperclassman if any suspicious person passed by, he was informed that only pizza and sushi deliveries came near the area. Conan then dismisses his suspicion and concludes that Haibara must have been overreacting only, unaware of the fact that Kanenori is an undercover member of the organization. Rumi then menacingly watches Kanenori leaving as he delivered the sushi.\n",
    "Kaitou Kid and the Siren's Splash (Manga: 1100-1102, Anime: 1150-1151)": "Before the heist, Kanenori asked Conan if there was anything strange about the teacher who glaring at him while he was making deliveries.

He also orders them to retrieve Curaçao to verify if the message is authentic or not.\n- When she finally regained her lost memory, Curaçao's flashback shows Rum speaking to Vermouth through a computer in an altered voice. In the past, Vermouth was about to execute Curaçao because her brain recorded facts inconvenient to the organization, but Rum's voice stopped her. He appointed Curaçao as his right-handed agent.\n- Vermouth has a conversation with him during the ending credit, while she is in her car along with Kir. She lets Kir listen to what he has to say before hanging up.\n",

    "Twilight Job-changing (Hanzawa the Criminal: 41, Anime: TBD)": "",
    "Great Puppy Pometaro ~The Paw of Blue Sapphire~ (Hanzawa the Criminal: 42, Anime: TBD)": "",
    "Black Iron Submarine (Movie: 26)": "He orders his men to use a submarine to destroy the Interpol underwater facility, and also wonder about the boss whereabouts since he initially intended to use the AI system to locate him.\n",
    "Hints that Rum is Kanenori Wakita": "- He may be able to fit all three descriptions of Rum, even though it was revealed that they are just a rumor planted by himself so better conceal his identity. He wears a patch over his left eye, which may conceal a prosthetic, and has still it despite saying that it will heal. Both of the other suspects, Kuroda and Wakasa, apparently have their right eye blind/prosthetic, which is why he stands out among them.\n- He has an interest in Sleeping Kogoro, just like Gin, while Wakasa and Kuroda personally have more interest in Conan. On top of that, since it was Sleeping Kogoro that solved the murder behind the occult detective who try to solve Kohji Haneda's murder case, it is only natural Rum's main focus and interest would be on Kogoro, because he wants to stop him from investigating the truth behind that murder at all cost. He took an interest in reports of Shinichi's return and even tried to visit his house.\n- Rum in text messages has twice used the English phrase \"Time is money\", which can be translated into Japanese as \"時は金なり\", whose Romanization \"Toki wa kane nari\" is an anagram of \"Wakita Kanenori\".\n- He can be deceptive. As of now, he has yet to meet Haibara and communicate with her directly in any cases, making him the primary suspect to have a different response compared to Kuroda and Wakasa when seeing her later. However, in file 1072, Haibara felt the aura of organization and, at that time, Wakita was riding a motorbike passed Teitan Elementary School.\n- Like Bourbon, whose workplace was just a floor under Mouri detective agency, his workplace is one of Kogoro's favourite hangout places, which is just next door to it. This in turn allows him to move around freely and observe Kogoro's or his associates' movement much closely, without the need of using complex disguise like Vermouth and raising any suspicions to almost anyone, since public would believe he is a normal sushi seller that goes around delivering it to customers when being compared to Wakasa and Kuroda. Even if there is no customers that ordered sushi for delivery, he can easily fake an order to his own shop, thus allowing him to leave it either way, just like when he can investigate Shinichi.\n- When Amuro, Conan, Kogoro, and Wakita were on the train to Nagano mountain, he said that he hated betrayal, which seemingly meant he sensed that Bourbon betrayed him by sending him fake information about Shinichi's death. He completely snapped when the suspects started badmouthing Kogoro's actions after checking the victim's condition, something that Bourbon hinted afterwards that Rum is an impatient person. What's more interesting, after the whole case had been solved, Morofushi came to them and pretended he didn't know Amuro by shaking hands with Kogoro, asking him who these two men were, although Taka'aki had met him before when Scotch was still alive. Presumably, Kuroda ordered Taka'aki calling him to help Amuro by acting as a stranger in front of Wakita, so that his true identity as an undercover agent working for the NPA could be hidden. Before leaving, Taka'aki didn't forget to mention a saying which was similar to \"Time is money\".\n- In his debut, he even mentioned that he is a drifter, which may hint that he never stays in one place very long, so that he can go where ever the organization or boss needs him to be to investigate an important matter, and if necessary to take care of the problem, and then disappear quickly. A customer asked what happened to the regular waiter, and he answered that he was in an accident, which was probably arranged, so that he can have this job to spy on the Mouri detective agency, and in particular Kogoro. One of the suspects says he wants to go home to watch the episode of Kamen Yaiba on TV where the boss' second-in-command would appear.\n",
    "Relationships analysis": "",
    "Black Organization": "Renya Karasuma is his direct superior, meaning that the boss must trust him the most, enough to make him the new highest ranking executive agent after his late father's long service. He has Karasuma's support to do criminal activities, such as blackmailing big names in the political and financial world in order to strengthen their position. About forty-seven years ago, he appeared at the International Economic Forum's annual general meeting on behalf of Karasuma, who was absent due to poor health. However, he is scolded by Karasuma when his conspicuous actions can threaten the secrecy of the organization, for example by burning an island, instead of searching closely, to lure out their target. Even he has not seen Karasuma in a long time and has been trying to find out about his whereabouts.\nGin knows Rum's true identity and that he works at the sushi restaurant with a silly pseudonym. Apparently, Gin trusts and follows his commands without questioning them or complaining about them. Although, he does get annoy when Rum get praise every time.\nRum suggested a level of trust in Vermouth's judgement.\nCuraçao is a member who works as Rum's right-hand agent. In the past, because her brain recorded facts inconvenient to the organization, Vermouth was about to execute her, but he decided to appoint her as his right-hand agent.\nPinga is the new right-hand of Rum after Curaçao's death.\n",
    "Enemies": "About sixty-seven years ago, when he was only a child, Amanda Hughes met him as a guest at Karasuma's birthday party. Fifty years later, they met again at a hotel in the United States. Instead of become part of their family, she sacrificed herself to save her adoptive daughter and swallowed his drug developed by the organization, which led to her death. She left a dying message to warn about his eye's special ability.\nSeventeen years ago, Kohji Haneda met him at his hotel room, while hiding Amanda's bodyguard. Kohji knew he was associated with Karasuma and, refusing to tell about Asaka's whereabouts, he was beaten by one of their men and drugged by Rum, which led to his death.\n",
    "Quotes": "— Kanenori to Bourbon, file 1027, page 3\n— Rum to himself at the end of Chess Tournament Murder Case when he failed to assassinate Rachel Asaka.\n",
    "Name origin": "\"Kanenori Wakita\" is a silly name and an anagram of \"Toki wa kane nari\", the Romanization into Japanese of his English catch phrase \"Time is money\" (時は金なり).\nGosho Aoyama, as a crossover joke, has introduced Lum Invader, the female protagonist from the manga Urusei Yatsura, as the Black Organization member Rum. He also showed Lum in a panel in file 906. Lum's name has a similar pronunciation to \"Rum\" because \"R\" and \"L\" sound the same in Japanese.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Kanenori Wakita's character is a homage to one-eyed boxing coach Danpei Tange from the 1968 boxing manga series Ashita no Joe.\n- Rum's car is a 1962 Black Bentley S3 \"Standard Steel Saloon\", with a crow as bonnet statue in the anime version, driven around by two organization members. He also uses a scooter to deliver sushi.\n"
