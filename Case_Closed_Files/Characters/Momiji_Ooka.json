    "Background": "Momiji Ooka is a second-year student from Kyoto Senshin High School and a champion of Hyakunin Isshu karuta. She lives in the Higashiyama district of Kyoto and her family, the Ooka group, is likely wealthy, since she has a personal butler and her retiree grandfather is the former Prime Minister[2], third to Renya Karasuma and Suzuki plutocrats in Tokyo.[3] Momiji claims Heiji \"proposed her when they were little\" and thus believes that they will be romantically involved in the future. Momiji was once part of an elite karuta association called Nagoro-kai. She was the greatest student of the group's founder, Nagoro Shikao. However, after the group was disbanded, she joined another association called the Satsuki-kai.\nMomiji appears to be an extremely competent detective, as she saw through a trick merely based on a sound she heard in a phone call with her butler, Muga Iori, before Conan, Heiji or Amuro did. Later, Iori says that her deduction was great as usual, implying that she regularly solves cases and also says that Heiji's great deductive skill was to be expected from the person that Momiji chose as her partner. Momiji is involved in the movie plot which will center around Heiji and Kazuha's romance. She was shown crying in the movie artwork. The movie shows her in an uta-karuta tournament and introducing herself as \"Heiji's fiancé\", plus there's a picture of her and Heiji's younger selves making a pinky swear.\n",
    "Personality": "Momiji has a close personal interest in Heiji's cases as he makes the news. For some reason, she believes Heiji will be her future husband, despite his feelings for Kazuha. She and Heiji did meet as children and apparently made a promise. Momiji is also extremely smart, especially in regards to catching details that others miss. When Iori informed her via phone some details about a case Heiji was working, Momiji actually caught other signals that Iori himself had missed and used them to reach a correct deduction that would greatly help Conan and Heiji. Iori also implies that Momiji engages in her own detective work at times, as she is no stranger to making such deductions. Momiji seems to be very girlish and a bit vain, plus fond of taking some degree of care in her appearance.\n",
