    "Background": "Shukichi Haneda was presumably born as Shukichi Akai until some incident, perhaps the death of his father, caused Shukichi and Masumi Sera to switch to using \"Sera\" as a family name. The Akai family apparently lived a rather wealthy life.[3] He might have been born in England. When the family moved to Japan, Shukichi's older brother Shuichi left them to study in America. After that his younger sister Masumi was born. Seven years after moving to Japan, he and his family were briefly reunited with Shuichi, who plans to join the FBI to investigate the death of their father. In middle school he was classmates with Tamami Minegishi, Sumika Kawana, Masaie Hakuya, Jinsuke Ninda and Satoko Imoto.[4]\nWhen Shukichi graduated from high school he began using the family name Haneda from Koji Haneda, a shogi player he admire. It is not clear what their relationship was. According to Yumi he asked to be adopted into the Haneda family. At some point he started his career as a professional shogi player.\nShukichi met Yumi Miyamoto for the first time on a train where he overslept, resting his head on Yumi's shoulder, and Yumi waited for him even though she had to miss her stop.[5] He attained the prestigious Meijin title back when he was still dating Yumi, without the latter knowing.[6]\nShukichi's main objective is to prove himself worthy as Yumi's boyfriend by secretly winning all seven shogi titles, despite having technically been dumped by her. He was widely known by the name of Taiko Meijin (太閤名人 ,Taikō Meijin?) in the world of shogi even before he finally achieved all seven titles in his most recent Shogi match, due to his unique skill.[7] Even though he then lost one in a revenge match with his rival Chikara Katsumata, he intends to stick with his original plan.\nShukichi currently lives in an apartment at Chateau Beika Condo (シャトー米花マンション ,Shatō Beika Manshon?), the same place as when he was still going out with Yumi.[8]\n",
    "Personality": "Shukichi has a very cheerful personality, which Yumi (to her annoyance) perceived as immature. In front of Yumi and other characters, he rarely suppresses his emotions, which can range from overly joyful when meeting his ex-girlfriend, to hilariously disapproving when the latter announces that their relationship was over. Despite this, Shukichi does show a calmer and more serious side during some situations, most notably when he is making his deductions or when he appears in front of the media.\nOn the other hand, Shukichi is quite confident and proud of his excellent memory, as seen when he proclaims himself the best memorizer in the world.[9] From his goal of achieving all seven shogi titles to win Yumi's admiration, he shows himself as a person with great patience and determination. The only thing which can disturb him is his intense feelings for Yumi; his belief in her love for him affects his performance at shogi immensely, making her his effective muse,he is even willing to leave an important match to save her like durning meijin title match which he left to save her.\nHe is also a strong detective, more skilled than Masumi. She often consulted him on cases over the phone, double-checking her deductions.\nHe is also a little careless and carefree shown in file 1043-1046 when he found out culprit's identity he went to talk with him and ask him to surrender but he get himself caught\nHe only loves Yumi and didn't betray her. Even after she dumped him, he doesn't want to tell Yumi about his shogi profession to surprise her and didn't tell her about the practice group. For example, there are women in it so she won't be jealous.\n",
    "Appearance": "Shukichi Haneda is perhaps the most characterized by his hair, which sticks up in the back like a bed head. He is often shown wearing glasses, usually except when he is playing shogi or is being interviewed as a professional shogi player.\nUnlike his two siblings who resemble their mother, Shukichi is most similar to his father.[10]\nHe apparently dresses in slouchy clothes like jerseys fairly often. In Shogi matches he wears traditional attire.\n",
    "Abilitites and skills": "",
    "Shogi": "Shukichi Haneda has won numerous shogi matches and earned himself the title Meijin, which, along with Ryu-oh, is the most prestigious title in the professional shogi titleholder system.[11][12] In Taiko Meijin's Match of Love, he managed to attain all seven titles. During the events of the Missing Envelope Case, Shukichi loses his title defense match for the Osho title against Chikara Katsumata and subsequently only holds six titles at the moment.\n",
    "Memorization": "Shukichi is extremely skillful at memorizing, as shown when he managed to remember the code written on Sakurako Yonehara's paper despite having only seen it for a very short amount of time. He also claims to be the best in this field.[9]\n",
    "Deductive abilities": "Shukichi Haneda is very intelligent, something his skill in memorization appears to help. His intelligence seems to be well-known among the students from his high school, as he apparently has solved some mysteries in his class during his time studying there.[13] It is possible his intelligence may even outstrip his older brother Shuichi's since Sera characterizes the already intelligent Shuichi as \"strong\" in contrast to the middle brother's \"smart\". Shukichi often advises Masumi on cases via cellphone.[10] He was able to correctly deduce over the phone that Masumi's deduction was unreliable in a bathroom murder case. He was able to solve a murder case next to his house, where he effectively figured out the trick behind the victim's suicide note, as well as the culprit's identity. His intelligence might even surpasses Conan's; In the events of the Shogi Player Serial Murder Case, he managed to figure out the culprit's identity much earlier than Conan.\n",

    "Plot overview": "",

However, he hasn't contacted her ever since then, so she officially broke up with him.\nWhen a murder takes place at his neighboring apartment, Shukichi becomes one of the prime suspects as he knows the code to acquire the spare key. That is when he finally meets his ex-girlfriend again after all those years. He cheerfully introduces to everyone about their relationship, only to be denied by Yumi.\nAs the investigation progresses, Shukichi perceives the true nature of the victim's suicide note, calling it \"a well prepared move\", which turns out to be an important clue. Later, when asked about his own alibi, Shukichi refuses to answer, much to Yumi's annoyance. However, he mentally tells her not to be worried, while confidently looking at Conan, who's already figured out the truth about the case.\nConan, with Shukichi's helps, points out that the culprit is the victim's husband. Shukichi explains that the suicide note was actually written four years ago, on an airplane that almost crashed; the culprit used it to fake her death as a suicide. He also reveals that he has suspected the husband since he saw the note, and his theory was confirmed when he overheard his conversation with his son.\nAt the end of the case, it is revealed that Shukichi is in fact the famous shogi player called \"Taiko Meijin\", and was having a match when the crime occured. He kept quiet about it so Yumi couldn't find out about his occupation. It's also revealed that the reason he's so determined in winning all seven shogi titles is because when the two were still dating, Yumi used to express her admiration for a sumo champion who had won six tournaments in a row.\n",
    "Bathroom murder case's failed deduction (Manga: 856-858, Anime: 740-741)": "Sera had called Shukichi regarding the \"adultery case\" she was about to investigate and was overheard by Eri.

Sera also informs her brother than Conan seems to have figured out the case, but she isn't sure of her answer since her confidence has been shaken as of late. Her brother texts Sera asking who she keeps talking about. Sera sends him a picture of Conan and Shukichi replies that \"it is no problem\" if it is Conan doing the deducing, after all Shukichi had a good experience with Conan's deductions in The Ex-Boyfriend Living Next to a Crime Scene.\nMasumi is very surprised and wonders how her brother knows Conan. Her suspicion makes sense because she knows that Conan didn't exist prior to Shinichi shrinking.[30] The brother later sends another text to Masumi which most likely said something about how he met Conan during a case before. This makes Masumi react \"Ah, I see. So that's how it is.\"[31] At the end of the unseen message is a PS asking if she has \"already met the wizard.\" Sera looks over at Conan and thinks \"You could say so...\" while sending a reply.\n",

Despite this, it appears she still has some feelings for him.\nTheir relationship began to relapse after Shukichi was caught up in a murder case in his apartment complex. Despite Yumi acting standoffish most of the time, they start using pet names for each other once again. They even exchanged a kiss before Shukichi continued his shogi match to win the seventh title. By the time Yumi figured out Shukichi's real identity, Shukichi was regularly meeting with her. All of this time, Yumi still insisted on calling him an ex.\nYumi was unaware of Shukichi being a famous shogi player for a long time, mostly due to her lack of interest in investigating, and an apparent personal disinterest in shogi (she is more of a Mahjong type). She assumed Shukichi was a \"meijin\" at some minor game like shiratori or fishing. She eventually saw Shukichi on television and figured it out. After realizing that meijins can make 100,000,000 yen in salary, she desperately tries to reclaim the letter he left for her, which her ornery building manager had seized.\nAfter Shukichi lost the decisive match against Chikara Katsumata,Yumi rips the letter on Shukichi's favour as it became invalid due to his loss.

Despite the ten year age separation between Masumi Sera and her moving abroad, nevertheless she and Shukichi kept in touch by phone. Masumi Sera frequently calls him to ask about case solutions.[10] Shukichi appears to have avoided telling Masumi anything about his Shogi skills or what he has been up to. She has no idea where he is living.[10]\n",
    "Kohji Haneda": "Kohji was a talented shogi player that his \"not-related-by-blood\"[32] brother, Shukichi Haneda, deeply respected. Many had high hopes that Kohji would win all seven of the major shogi titles, but Rum killed him preventing it. It's likely that Shukichi changed one of his name characters slightly to honor the late Kohji.\n",
    "Shuichi Akai": "Shuichi Akai keeps track of Shukichi Haneda's shogi matches. During a reunion ten years ago Shukichi shows concern over his brother's choice of path in life. During the Policewomen Serial Murder Case, when Yumi is accosted by drunkards, Shuichi as Subaru incapacitates them and has them leave her alone. It is shown when he is alone he received a text by Shukichi to protect Yumi, indicating the brothers are in contact.\n",
    "Mary Sera": "Mary Sera is Shukichi's mother. While stuck in the body of a middle schooler, she is shown keeping track of Shukichi Haneda's shogi matches.\nShe smiled when he became the seven-crowned king. Shukichi is shown to be unaware of his mother current circumstances and hasn't been in contact wanted to introduce Yumi to her and asked Shuichi what their being doing to which Shuichi reassure him that he would see their mother sooner or later.\n",
    "Miyano Family": "In File 1049, the flashback conversations between Vermouth and Mary confirmed that Mary and Elena are sisters. So that Shukichi is blood relatives with Miyano family.\n",
    "Conan Edogawa": "Shukichi seems to have noticed Conan's intelligence and trusted his deductions the first time they met. He even writes to his sister, that it's all right if Conan make the deductions. Shinichi has met Shukichi in the past as a child, so it's possible that Shukichi might recognize him as Conan because of his memorization skills, and also due to Shukichi calling Conan a Wizard, the same nickname that Masumi attributed to Shinichi when they met 10 years ago. It's also possible that his brother Shuichi told him about Conan given that Shukichi knows of Akai having faked his death.\n",
    "Chikara Katsumata": "Chikara Katsumata is Shukichi's only shown Shogi rival and the holder of the one of the seven main Shogi titles. He claimed the seventh title from Katsumata in Taiko Meijin's Match of Love. Shukichi then lost a revenge match to Chikara in The Marriage Registration's Password, leaving him with only six titles.\n",
    "Name origin": "According to Gosho, the full name Shukichi Haneda (羽田 秀𠮷 ,Haneda Shūkichi?) and the in-story nickname Taiko (太閤 ,Taikō?) are both references to Hideyoshi Toyotomi (豊臣 秀吉), who was previously named Hideyoshi Hashiba (羽柴 秀吉).[33] Additionally, Haneda's \"Hane\" (羽) also comes from Yoshiharu Habu (羽生 善治), a real-life professional shogi player who has won all seven titles.[34] Gosho also revealed that the \"kichi\" part of his name comes from Sankichi Sakata (阪田 三𠮷) in an Animal Crossings Promotional Hint on January 18, 2016.\nThere is one wrinkle in the above information. Because of Shukichi's backstory related to Kohji Haneda, then the true source for Haneda (羽田) is likely the list of people killed by APTX 4869, and Gosho's shogi source explanation was ex post facto. There are only two ways for both Gosho's shogi source explanation and the List of APTX 4869 victim source to be true. One is that Gosho decided on the name Haneda, and then noticed the name on the list and came up with additional backstory for Shukichi on the spot, or that Gosho planned out Haneda's backstory in Volume 18, 15 years before he was actually introduced. That second explanation is perhaps a bit of a stretch, as Masumi Sera was only created in response to the positive fan reaction to female detective Natsuki Koshimizu, some eight years after volume 18 was published.\nShukichi's prior surname Sera (世良 ,Sera?) is from the Mobile Suit Gundam character Sayla Mass (セイラ・マス ,Seira Masu?).[35] Shukichi's oldest surname \"Akai\" comes from the Mobile Suit Gundam character Char Aznable, whose nickname was the \"Red Comet\" (赤い彗星 ,Akai Suisei?).\n",
    "Quotes": "— Shukichi, after telling his story about his first meeting with Yumi to Detective Boys, File 900 pg 8\n",
    "Trivia": "- Shukichi is right-handed.\n- In file 946, Yumi reveals that she nicknames him 'Chukichi' because he keeps eating cheese like a rat which makes a noise that sounds a lot like 'Chu'. He is shown to like cake.\n- Shukichi can speak English.\n"
