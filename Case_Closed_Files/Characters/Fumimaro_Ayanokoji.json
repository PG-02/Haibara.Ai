    "Background": "Fumimaro Ayanokoji is the head inspector from Kyoto Prefectural Police. He is known to be polite and snarky, as well as of noble descent from a Kuge family, and is called \"Inspector Ojaru\" (おじゃる警部 ,Ojaru-keibu?).[1] He has no close friends, with the sole exception is Maro, the cute little chipmunk who carries everywhere in his jacket pocket and even changed his phone wallpaper from a chipmunk for him. He was supposedly a school mate and rival of Shiratori, but the latter doesn't approve of that. He lives in the ancient district of Higashiyama.[2] He speaks the Kyoto dialect and usually uses sophisticated language. He is said to be a rather competent and intelligent inspector, which is the reason why he has been promoted so quickly two years before. He disposes of a wide range of staff for investigating and stays punctual. He is clearly infatuated with Chikasuzu, a 19-year-old maiko, but it's unknown if reciprocated.\n",

He stays truely attached to his pet chipmunk, which is his only best friend, and they are undetachable, although people judge it weird. In general, he stays serious, always remains friendly and expresses himself politely, but occasionally also shows a sarcastic streak, doesn't liking when people interfere with his stuff, like when Heiji tried to investigate on his love interest, which made him nervous. Furthermore, just like Kogoro and Shiratori, discovering that Enkai, an old chief priest, is her natural father, he became furious and defined him: \"That dirty priest!\" He is afraid by Tengu's stories and doesn't like archery. He is impressed by Conan's high intelligence and appreciates his help, knowing that he can be crucial help just like Heiji, often allowing him to investigate and tamper by himself, not like other regular policemen.
