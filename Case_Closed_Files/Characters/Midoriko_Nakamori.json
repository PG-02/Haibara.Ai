    "Background": "Midoriko Nakamori is a 40-year-old public prosecutor at the Tokyo Public Prosecutor's Office, where she is one of its best members, as her superiors describe her as being on the road to become prosecutor general. She lives in an Ekoda free-standing house along with her husband Ginzo and her daughter Aoko and is the one taking care of cooking. She dated Ginzo for many years and both started working before they married, and after their marriage, to avoid fights, they stopped talking to each other about their work.\n",
    "Appearance": "She is a woman of medium height, being about a foot taller than her daughter Aoko, who is 160 centimeters tall. She is short and slender and has her hair tied in a bun, with bangs sent towards the right. She wears half-rim glasses and is shown wearing lipstick and makeup. Ten years ago, she tied her hair in a ponytail along with a scrunchie. She is seen wearing business casual clothes.\n",
    "Personality": "Her personality is quite different from that of her daughter, who takes from her father's brash and agressive personality. She is shown to be a much more calculating person and is able to easily notice tricks and patterns that stand out, as well as small details, like the fact that Kaito dislikes fish. She is also meticulous, often working long hours to get things done, causing her to often not sleep enough. Thus, she often falls asleep and spends her free time sleep-banking. She also does not keep up with the news nor watches TV. As an excellent prosecutor, she can be compared to Eri Kisaki, the mother of Detective Conan's deuteragonist Ran Mouri, an excellent lawyer and an equally calculating fighter.\n",

    "Name origin": "Her last name, just like her daughter and husband's, was taken from Akina Nakamori (中森 明菜)[2], an extremely popular pop idol at the time Gosho Aoyama started drawing Magic Kaito, and who is also the model for Aoko's character design. Her first name contains the character for child \"ko\" (子), like all other female characters in the series (Akako, Aoko, Keiko, etc.). The \"midori\" (碧) part means \"green\", as all characters are related to a colour[N 1]\n",
    "Trivia": "- Due to her late appearance in the series and the fact she was never mentioned in any previous chapters, fans theorized she could have been dead, which Gosho referenced when he had Keiko say that she thought Aoko's mother was dead[4].\n",
