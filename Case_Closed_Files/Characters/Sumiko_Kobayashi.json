    "Background": "Sumiko Kobayashi attended Teitan Elementary and was in the 18th graduating class, two classes above Kazunobu Chiba. She became the new class teacher of Conan and the Detective Boys after Toya, their previous teacher, had married and retired. Her harsh behavior towards her charges had earned her the nickname \"oni-baba\" (hag) amongst her students.\nOne night, the Detective Boys came into the school to investigate strange occurrences involving busts from art class and an anatomy model from the sick room, which had been mysteriously moved around, and the unexplained absence of the vice principal. The busts and the model had actually been used by Sumiko for a rehearsal for the next parent-teacher conference. Sumiko is in fact very fond of children, but her kindness had caused her to have very little control over her class at her previous school, resulting in a disastrous parent-teacher conference. To fix this, she had forced herself to be strict and harsh when she transferred to Teitan Elementary, but after the Detective Boys discovered her nicer side, she decided to be herself again and has become very popular with her students ever since.[1] She is the one who introduced Ai Haibara.\nOn one occasion, she accompanied Conan and the Detective Boys to an interview which became a murder investigation as they found the reporter slain. After witnessing Conan in action, she announced her desire to join the Detective Boys and become their manager, a decision which was immediately vetoed[2] and is commonly neglected in the field.[3]\nAs it turned out later, when Sumiko was still a small child, she had confronted two no-good juveniles attempting to steal mangas from a bookshop. When the culprits contemptuously shoved her aside, a young boy intervened on her behalf, cooly citing a paragraph from Japanese law concerning theft. As a sign of gratitude, Sumiko bought her rescuer a drink ornamented with a circle of sakura flowers made from the straw wrapper, as a symbol of goodness and justice (referring to the sakura shaped Japanese police badges). It would not be until many years later that she would encounter him again as a member of the police force, under the name of Ninzaburo Shiratori.[4]\nShiratori recognized Sumiko on first sight, and it turned out he had held deep feelings for her all these years. However, he wanted to win properly Sumiko's affection first and then tell her about what he viewed as the hand of fate, so he kept silent about their first encounter and banned the Detective Kids from helping him in any way. This scheme backfired when she found out that she had a dead lookalike in the police department whom Shiratori had once pursued romantically, unbeknownst to her, that was because Shiratori mistook her for Sumiko.\nThinking that Shiratori considered her a mere replacement for Sato, Sumiko was understandably hurt and started distancing herself from him, even after Shiratori personally explained their common past to her - a move which came at a bad time, because she had become an unwitting (and the sole) witness to a murder and the murderer would therefore try everything to silence her. And for worse, Sumiko's own memories of their encounter were much more vague than Shiratori's own. so she thought Sato was his \"girl of destiny\".[5] When the culprit was apprehended and Shiratori subdued him with words, Sumiko did indeed remember Shiratori as her childhood savior/friend, and the relationship was reaffirmed.[6]\n",
    "Personality": "Sumiko is very kind and fond of children, considering them the most wonderful thing in the world. Sumiko is also quite timid and sensitive, not to mention that she suffers from serious stagefright. Even though she has appointed herself the manager of the Detective Boys, the kids often leave her out of case or ignore her warnings. She was also quite hurt when she believed Inspector Shiratori was only interested in her because of her resemblance to Miwako Sato, a resemblance so striking it even fooled Sato's close associates Chiba and Yumi.[7][8]\nIn contrast of Sumiko's physical resemblance to Sato, however, the two women have almost entirely different personality traits: While Sato is reckless, outspoken, daring, and impulsive, Sumiko is more gentle, softspoken, cautious, and careful in any given situation.\nSumiko loves mystery novels, particularly the works of Edogawa Rampo. Because of this, Haibara suggests that she and Shiratori would work well together because Sumiko would enjoy hearing about cases from him.[9] One of the few things she openly dislikes or fears are birds, ever since she had watched a documentary in which vultures fed on a zebra carcass.[10]\n",

    "Plot overview": "",
    "School Mystery Case (Manga: 154-155, Anime: 112)": "In her first appearance, Sumiko was known by the students of Class 1-B, including Conan and the Detective Boys, as a strict, mean teacher, who was always disciplining her class, never showing any kindness. Her initial personality led to her students nicknaming her \"Old Demon Hag\". Then, one night, the Detective Boys decided to figure out why many dolls were missing one after another. Conan deduces the one behind the \"kidnappings\" was Sumiko herself, which relieved the children. Sumiko finally revealed the reason behind her \"dictator-like\" teaching was that, in the past, two of her students fought at a parent-teacher conference, because of her lack in discipline. She would come at Teitan Elementary at night to practice for the next parent-teacher conference, so there would be no more fights. However, with some suggestions from the Detective Boys, she changed her teaching style and became more well liked.\n",

However, the gang didn't expect a dead writer. When Inspector Megure and Wataru Takagi arrive at the scene, both believe that Sumiko is Sato because, without her glasses on, she bears a scary resemblance to the officer. Soon Conan tries to prove the Detective Boy's skills in catching the criminal, however, he also had to conceal his vast intelligence, so his secret wouldn't be questioned by Sumiko. Conan and his friends manage to drop hints on who the real culprit is which leads to his arrest.\nAfter the case, Sumiko dubbed herself the \"manager\" of the group, wanting to solve and capture \"bad guys\" along with them.\n",

The Detective Boys soon arrive and ask her if they want to come to a festival with her and she agrees. Soon, she loses sight of the children and as she's trying to find her way around, she becomes a witness of a murder. She was able to see the culprit's silhouette and hear their voice.\nThe next day, Sumiko goes to the police station, with the kids to testify what she saw. She meets Yumi Miyamoto and Kazunobu Chiba, who confuse her with Sato until Shiratori clears up the misunderstanding and escorts Sumiko to a conference so they can discuss the case in more detail. While on her way back from the restroom, she sees Sato from afar and is initially very happy and giddy at the thought of a woman who looks like her... but then she learns of Shiratori's former interest in Sato. This leads her to suspect that Shiratori only liked her because of her physical traits to the female officer, and depresses her greatly.\nFrom then on Sumiko begins to treat Shiratori harshly and, after seeing that the three main suspects weren't the criminal, she coldly tells Shiratori not to bother her anymore and leaves. The next day at school school, he tells her the real reason why he liked her, but she dismisses it, as she believes Sato was \"the girl of destiny\" and cannot remember their supposed \"meeting\". However, while working late at night, she was almost killed by the criminal in order to silence her, but is saved by Shiratori, the Detective Boys and Sato.\nSumiko then finally remembers Shiratori, after he calls out the culprit in almost exactly the way he called out the shoplifters to help her. Shiratori then confesses he was always in love with her and Sumiko blushes and replies, \"Yes.\". Later, she makes a special bento for Shiratori, signifying that the two are now a couple.\n",

    "Relationships analysis": "",
    "Ninzaburo Shiratori": "As a child, Sumiko instantly became Shiratori's true love, and was the very reason why he entered the police force. They had confronted a bunch of shoplifters together as children; Shiratori had prevented her from getting hurt and also stopped the theft, and as thanks she gave him a cup of cola with a band made of straw wrappers, shaped like the sakura blossoms that look like the symbol of the Japanese Police.\nFor quite a while Shiratori believed that Miwako Sato was the girl he had loved since childhood and changed his life forever, due to her resemblance with the \"girl of destiny\", hence he was interested in her. At the beginning of a case that revealed parts of Shiratori's past, he realized Sato wasn't his true love, and even if she was, she had chosen Wataru Takagi over him. Even worse, at the end of the said case, Shiratori was left depressed and exhausted, since another woman who could have been his long-lost love actually turned out to be the culprit. However, Ayumi cheered him up by saying the exact same lines that the girl from his past said and by making the same design on the wristband she gave him. Shiratori desperately asked who taught her that, and Ayumi told him it was her school teacher, Sumiko. Then, at that exact moment, Sumiko came to pick up the Detective Boys upon Juzo Megure's request.\nWhen Shiratori laid his eyes on Sumiko, he instantly recognized her as his true \"woman of destiny\", and their relationship began to spark. He would always warn her of any dangers nearby where she worked or lived, which caused Sumiko to develop romantic feelings. In fact, his concern over her, constant visits, and kindness towards her, often caused her to blush deeply.\nWhen Sumiko became a witness in a murder investigation, she learned of her resemblance to Detective Sato. And after hearing about Shiratori's former crush on her from other policemen, she thought that the only reason he was so interested in her was because of her striking resemblance to Sato. This left her not only shocked, but also hurt, thinking Shiratori didn't have feelings for her. This wasn't helped by Shiratori not having told her about their shared past, as he was waiting for the right moment to do so.\nNot knowing the real reason why Shiratori liked her, Sumiko began to act coldly and harshly towards him. Even when he confessed his true feelings to her and told her about their meeting, she brushed it off, thinking Shiratori confused her with Detective Sato. However, it was all cleared up by the end of the case, when he not only saved her from the culprit, but also coolly recited a law the same way he did as a child in that book store, which finally reminded her of their first meeting. Shiratori romantically confessed to her, which made her blush. She replied with a quick and simple \"Yes\".\nAfterwards, the two began dating, and Sumiko started giving Shiratori bentos every morning for his \"energy demanding\" work. On White Day, Shiratori was seen with many presents inside his car for her. Later on, she was shown with all the delicious sweets Shiratori had brought for her, at her house, happily not knowing where to begin.\n",
