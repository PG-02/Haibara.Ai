    "Background": "Seventeen years ago, Tsutomu Akai was involved in the double murders of Kohji Haneda and Amanda Hughes. He got a call from Yasuharu Haneda (Father of Kohji Haneda) to investigate the murder case of his son as he couldn't trust the local or Japanese police. So he visited America. What happened to him during and after the incident is currently unknown. He was believed to be deceased by his family, though his body was never found. It was his involvement with the murder case that prompted his first son Shuichi to join the FBI in order to investigate what happened to him, and his assumed death led Shuichi to seek vengeance against those responsible.\nBefore he went missing, Tsutomu sent his wife a message telling her that he had made enemies with \"horrible people\", asking her to take their children, Shuichi and Shukichi, to Japan, and to think of him as someone who no longer existed. Sometime after his daughter Masumi was born, so both she and her father never got to know each other.\n",

    "A Chance Meeting at the Beach (Manga: 974, Anime: 882)": "Ten years ago, Mary reminds Shuichi of his father's last words before his death: \"Pretend I never existed. I seem to have made some serious enemies\". Shuichi reflects that Tsutomu's body still hasn't been found. When Shuichi speaks of being \"infected by the disease called curiosity\", Mary is immediately reminded of Tsutomu. Shukichi is also reminded of Tsutomu when Mary tells Shuichi to \"purge the fog that covers the truth\".\n",
    "Antique Facet Case (Manga: 1037-1038, Anime: 1019-1020)": "After having talked to his sister, Shuichi recalls a flashback, where it said that his father was hired/requested by his friend Yasuharu Haneda, Kohji's father, to investigate his son's suspicious death in the United States, but after having found out that his enemy was in fact really powerful, instructed his wife and sons to leave England secretly for Japan, where it could be safer for them and it was at this time that Tsutomu disappeared, seventeen years ago. It's revealed that Tsumotu uses the phrase \"It was 50:50 so we're both to blame\", which is what Shuichi inherited from and Mary uses as well.\n",
