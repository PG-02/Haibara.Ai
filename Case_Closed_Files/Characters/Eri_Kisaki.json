    "Background": "The separately-living wife of Kogoro Mouri, Eri is a defense lawyer who often gets tangled in Kogoro's cases, usually serving as an extra pair of eyes when it becomes time to investigate a crime. Although she does not like Kogoro's attitude and personality (especially his drinking and skirt-chasing habits), she still deeply loves and cares for him, often testing him to see if he still cares about her as well.\nEri and Kogoro, like Shinichi and Ran and Heiji and Kazuha, had been best friends since childhood, falling in love in their teens. Ten years before the Detective Conan storyline starts, however, Kogoro and Eri separated and took different paths in their lives.[4] Ran had believed that Eri had separated from Kogoro because he had shot her in the leg to get her away from a crazed serial killer, when in fact Eri had completely respected Kogoro for his decision, which she also believed was the correct one. She had left him when she had cooked him a gratitude dinner afterwards, which Kogoro assessed (perhaps rightfully) to be completely inedible.[5] After this, Eri focused full time on her duties as a lawyer and has since become a highly respected (and feared) member of her profession, which in time even resulted in a movie based on her performance in court.[6]\nIn high school, Eri and her schoolmate and close friend, Yukiko Kudo, was involved in a \"Miss Teitan High School\" pageant and were tied in the number of votes, due to the lateness of Kogoro.[7] He had forgotten to vote, and by the time he had come to vote, it was too late.[7] It was later discovered that due to his clumsiness, he thought that the \"Miss\" meant \"mistake\" and was going to vote for Eri as a result of that misconception, much to her anger later on.[7]\n",
    "Personality": "Eri is considered incredibly attractive. Various men of different ages have pined for her, but she always turns them down, mostly due to her feelings for Kogoro.[8][9][10] She and Yukiko were considered the two most beautiful girls at Teitan High School back when they were students.[7] Even though the result ended in a tie, the two remained very close friends, often letting little Shinichi and Ran play together and have playdates.[11] Shinichi remembers often how Eri would give him a big scolding for starting trouble.[8]\nEri's personality suits her occupation as a lawyer. She is often very questioning and gets herself involved in the investigation of cases along with Kogoro, much to his chagrin. She is also tactical and has high moral ground, generally avoids accepting requests from people with clear criminal act[12] unless she believes that there is something behind the scene or the request is related to the case she and/or Kogoro are investigating in.\nShe has a cat, a Russian Blue named \"Goro,\" whom she cares for very deeply; in fact, Goro's name comes from \"KoGORO\" of Kogoro Mouri, since to her the cat and Kogoro both act very similar in some ways.[13][9] Eri is also very close friends with her secretary, Midori Kuriyama.\nRan often goes to Eri for advice, especially on Ran's relationship with Shinichi.[14] Eri has often half-jokingly said that her best advice for Ran is to never get involved with a detective.[8] In chapter 985, it's revealed Lawyers like Eri use Western-style comma (,).\nEri is shown to care for those she knows and loves, like in movie 4, she came and stayed with Kogoro, because Ran had amnesia. In episode 474, she worried about her cat goro so much that she cried. She said she doesn't care about Kogoro. But in reality, however, she still loves him and said if he wouldn't flirt, she would return. In an episode, she pretended to not hear him because she isn't ready.\n",
    "Appearance": "Eri is a fairly tall and light-skinned woman. She has long and wavy brown hair reaching her lower-back with shorter bangs framing the sides of her face, most of which she usually keeps done up in a bun. Slender yet very curvaceous in built, she is shown to be very beautiful and admired by most men, using her wedding ring despite the separation as a deterrent to would-be suiters (while secretly also because she still loves Kogoro). She has been well-known for her stunning beauty since high school, where she was only ever rivaled by in looks by Yukiko Kudo. She wears simple black glasses and is commonly seen wearing business suits.\n",
    "Abilities": "",
    "Intelligence": "Eri is highly intelligent and skilled at solving cases, as in her first appearance she was able to find out the identity of the culprit and how the culprit did it.

With her sharp eye for detail, she has proven on more than one occasion that she can lend a big helping hand in cases, and her deductions are almost always accurate. She achieved a perfect score on the Tokyo College entrance exam and at only the age of 16, was recommended to study at Harvard College. [7][10]\n",
    "Martial arts": "Eri has advanced skilled at judo, being taught by her Kogoro. Her normal technique is ippon seoi-nage (one-arm shoulder throw) which she uses when facing criminals. She is shown to be fast and precise in her performance, able to quickly react to assailants much bigger than her and just as easily counter their attacks.\n",

She remembers Ran's ID to message her, but the kidnappers join the chat, making Ran, Kogoro, and Conan confused about which one the real Eri is. Conan is able to deduce that the real Eri uses Western commas instead of Japanese commas because she is a lawyer, meaning that the first messages about Eri being kidnapped are the real her. Eri calls them and Conan tells her to only use her nails to converse with them so that the kidnappers don't hear her.\nAfter Conan is able to deduce the general location of where she is, they race to find her.

    "Family and friends": "Eri's father has only been mentioned once, but it's noted that he cares a lot for his daughter and is very overprotective.\nEven though Eri is separated from Kogoro, and has been for quite some time, she still cares for him and loves him. She often mentions that she would go back to him if he would just be a little bit nicer and not act immaturely to her.[8] Very often, she sees Kogoro treat her nicely and gets hope, but then he does something stupid that angers her again, ruining any hope she has of them being back together. She remembers many very important dates in their relationship, and it is found out that she and Kogoro share many things in their minds, including the idea of wearing the outfits both, wore on their first date on its anniversary (each of them made this decision independently).[9] Very often, their daughter, Ran, tries to get them to hook up with each other by planning out ways for them to see each other out of the blue.[15] Ran also tries getting Eri to help give Kogoro clients.[16]\nIn The Fourteenth Target, Eri and Kogoro are shown having a great time eating dinner, but it ends when Kogoro looks out the window and sees the very attractive owner of the bar that he visits.[5] This makes Eri turn angry and act how she normally acts to Kogoro. In the two-part episode, Scuba Diving Murder Case, Eri accidentally loses her wedding ring on the beach, but pretends to have left it at home to see if Kogoro noticed.[15] She gets visibly angry when Kogoro doesn't appear to notice it, especially when he leaves their lunch early to go back to the beach.[15] Later, it is discovered that Kogoro had always known that she wasn't wearing her wedding ring, and had gone back to the beach to look for it.[15] This left a visibly shocked Eri to drive home speechless, but pleased.[15]\nIn another episode, Eri captures a confession from Kogoro saying that he misses her and wishes she would come back to him on a minidisc, replaying it over and over again afterwards.[10] However, even though they both miss each other, both of them still pretend not to care, and even become incredibly nasty to each other.[15] Kogoro even goes on the opposing side of a case that Eri is working on, in a plan done by her professional rival Reiko Kujo to try and get under Eri's skin.[17] However, her plan fails, as Kogoro's testimony can help out Eri's case instead of Reiko's.[17]\nDespite having a rocky relationship with Kogoro, Eri continues to have a very loving and nurturing relationship with their only daughter. Ran has been trying to get her parents back together ever since they started living separately when she was 6 years old[18]. When they can find the time, Eri and Ran like to meet up so they can catch up on what's been happening in each other's lives and during those moments together Ran tries to convince her mother to come back home to live with them as a family again[19]. Ran was determined to save Eri from her kidnappers in Lawyer Kisaki's SOS.\nShinichi/Conan and Eri share a somewhat equal level of intelligence when analysing crime scenes. Eri's deducing skills were more notable in Kogoro Mouri, Suspect, where she was able to submit a string and a piece of metal before Conan could bring it to Inspector Yamamura's attention. She considers Conan a big help in murder cases. At first, Eri seemed slightly suspicious of Conan, but later she concludes that he is simply a boy who is very smart for his age, even helping him in showing off deduction shows. Eri respects Shinichi/Conan's and his deducing skills and vaguely accepts Shinichi and Ran's relationship. She has also told Ran to \"choose her man carefully,\" indicating not to make the same mistake she did (most likely referring to her current unstable relationship with Kogoro jokingly).\nOn the other side, although Conan respects Eri, he is also afraid of her because he got scolded so many times by Eri in the past that he developed a negative reaction just from seeing her.
