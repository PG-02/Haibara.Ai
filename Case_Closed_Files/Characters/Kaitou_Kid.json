    "Toichi as Kid": "The classic Kaitou Kid outfit was originally developed for one of his stage performances to honor Arsène Lupin, but he decided to use it as his thief outfit after saving Phantom Lady.\n",
    "Jii as Kid": "Jii donned the costume of Kaitou Kid, but used a smiling mask, in order to lure out the organization that killed Toichi. He was only dressed as Kid twice before Kaito took over.\n",
    "Kaito as Kid": "Kid has dark brown hair (black in Magic Kaito 1412) with fringe that ends just above his eyes, but the rest of his hair is normally covered by a white top hat with a blue ribbon band. When dressed in his normal outfit, his right eye is covered by a white monocle that has a dangling green charm with a white clover imprinted on it. Kid's outfit consists of a white suit jacket on top of a blue shirt with a red tie and white dress slacks. The white Hang Glider Cape is attached to the jacket at Kid's shoulders. Kid wears blue socks with white Oxford style shoes with white soles. In his original appearances Kid wore white loafer type shoes.\nKid has been seen wearing black shirts and pants along with a black hat to help cover his face, usually when doing information gathering for heists or when he has his \"audience\" at his heists looking elsewhere. Apart from these two outfits, Kid is a master of disguise and has been seen disguising as several people throughout the course of Detective Conan and Magic Kaito.\nAt several instances, it has been demonstrated that Kid shares a close natural likeness with Shinichi Kudo.[35] This, on occasion (particularly in the non-canon appearances), allows him to pass himself off as Shinichi whenever needed, without requiring a special disguise.[36][37][38][39]\n",

    "People who know Kaitou Kid's real identity": "The canon characters who know Kaito Kuroba is the Kaitou Kid are Konosuke Jii, Akako Koizumi, Saguru Hakuba, Ruby Jones, and Chikage Kuroba. The characters who are or have been suspicious of Kaito are Ginzo Nakamori, and Aoko Nakamori. There are also one time characters from Magic Kaito who has found out Kaitou Kid's identity such as Ruby Jones from the Recollection of the Golden Eye and Prince Phillip of Ingram in the Crystal Mother's Tears.\n",
    "Character popularity": "- eBookJapan held a character popularity poll from April 12, 2011 to May 12, 2011 in which readers of Detective Conan (international included) could vote for their favorite character. Kid placed 1st in the poll with 1,460 votes out of the 5,883 that were cast.[63]\n- Kid placed 2nd in the results of a poll ranking the top 3 \"ikemen\" (\"good-looking men\") of the series aired during the promotional special for The Lost Ship in the Sky.[64]\n- In honor of the release of the 15th movie, Quarter of Silence, the official Conan movie website held a popularity poll for the top 10 Detective Conan characters. Kaito Kuroba/Kaitou Kid placed 2nd out of 10 with 18.99% of the votes cast.[65]\n- In honor of the release of the 800th manga chapter, Shonen Sunday held a popularity poll/contest containing 91 Detective Conan characters to choose from. Kaito Kuroba/Kaitou Kid placed 2nd overall with 1,696 votes.[66]\n",
    "Name origin": "Kaitou Kid was originally known as \"Kaitou 1412\" (\"kaitou\" meaning \"phantom thief\" in Japanese\"), but the exact origin of that name is unknown. According to what Sonoko told Ran, the \"1412\" part is rumored to come from the secret number that may have been given to him by an international organization like the FBI, the CIA, or Interpol. The information about the number was supposedly leaked to the media, leading to that number being used to describe the thief.[67]\nSometime later, a reporter scribbled the number 1412, referencing the thief, in a hastily-written note. This note was seen by Yusaku Kudo, who misread the numbers as \"KID.\" Thus, Yusaku was the one who invented the name Kaitou Kid.[68]\n",

    "Of Kaito Kid": "(Kid talking to Ran in The Lost Ship in the Sky)\n",
    "About Kaito Kid": "",
    "Trivia": "- Kuroba (黒羽 or クロバ ?) (Kaito and Toichi's family name) is also a way to pronounce \"clover\" (クロバー ,kurobaa?) in Japanese (the only difference is a long vowel). This is most likely why a clover appears on Kaitou Kid's monocle. Additionally, in the manga's second chapter Kid disguises himself as an old man named Count Clover. Also, Gosho's Animal Crossings characters are named after the playing card suits, with \"Clover\" introducing itself as Kaito Kuroba and dressing as Kaitou Kid (except with a black top hat).\n- Kaitou Kid was clearly modeled after the fictional gentleman thief Arsène Lupin, by French author Maurice Leblanc. In the French-speaking world, Lupin is as famous as Sherlock Holmes is in the English-speaking world. Interestingly, Holmes appeared in several Arsène Lupin stories; however, after Conan Doyle protested due to copyright laws, Leblanc changed the name to \"Herlock Sholmes.\"\n- Kaitou Kid signs his heist notes with a drawing of his face in abstract. He re-draws this insignia for each note, so that police will know that it was truly him and not an imitator using a scanned copy of a former insignia.\n- He made a cameo in A Challenge Letter to Shinichi Kudo ~Prologue Until Goodbye~, in his Hang Glider Cape when the bomb explodes in mid-air.\n- In The Last Wizard of the Century, the police attribute 134 cases of thievery to Kaitou Kid, fifteen of which have been overseas including America, France, Germany, and 12 other places. In total, 152 gems have been stolen with a net worth of 38,925,000,000 yen but this is obviously not considered canonical in the main story of Detective and Kaito Kid.\n- Akako Koizumi once dressed up as the Kaitou Kid to trick Saguru Hakuba into thinking Kaito was innocent. During her escape with the target jewel, she screamed in a revealingly girly manner, causing Aoko to deduce that the Kaitou Kid must be a homosexual.\n- In both the Japanese and English dub, Kaito Kuroba/Kaitou Kid shares the same voice actor as that of Shinichi Kudo.\n- Kaitou Kid apparently knows how to drive as shown when he was disguised as Kogoro Mouri in Volume 30: Sunset Manor Case.\n"
