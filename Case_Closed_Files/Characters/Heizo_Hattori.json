    "Background": "Heizo Hattori is the father of Heiji Hattori, the husband of Shizuka Hattori and the highest ranking officer in the Osaka Prefectural Police Headquarters, as Superintendent Supervisor.[2] He is close to Goro Otaki and Ginshiro Toyama, and it is due to his friendship with the latter that Heiji was able to meet Toyama's daughter Kazuha. He respects the famous Sleeping Kogoro and does not seem to have noticed Conan's extraordinary abilities, perhaps because they have only met a handful of times.\n",
    "Personality": "Heizo is very serious (especially when he is at work) and quite cold. However, he does have a softer side, and he cares about his family members and friends.\n",
    "Skills": "Heizo possesses superb observation skills, and his intelligence and dedication skills are also excellent, as, in every case (2 cases so far) with his personal involvement, he manages to correctly deduce the culprit. In the Tiger Scroll Case, he also devises a plan to bait the culprit and his henchmen out, and in the Yuki-Onna Murder Case he solves the case without even being at the murder scene and as quickly as Yusaku Kudo. His police rank implies that he knows the art of managing people, and gives him command of many of the police officers of Osaka.\nHeizo is additionally a practitioner of Kendo.\n",
    "Appellations": "\n",
    "Plot overview": "In most cases where he appears, Heizo only plays a minor role.\n",
    "Great Detective of the West (Manga: 93, Anime: 48)": "Megure mentions that Heiji's father is called Heizo.\n",
    "Bond of Fire Case (Manga: 150, Anime: 77)": "Heizo appears at the beginning of the case only; Dosan Nagato, a friend of his, introduces him to Kogoro, Ran and Conan. Since Heizo has work to do in Osaka, he sets off before long, leaving his son (whom he praises as having sharp observation skills) with Kogoro in Nagato's mansion.\n",
    "Stabbed Wallet Case (Manga: 185, Anime: 118)": "Again, Heizo only appears at the beginning. He is seen talking about the serial murder case with Ginshiro Toyama: since it appears to be indiscriminate, he warns that if the culprit is not caught soon, mass hysteria might occur. Toyama understands what the police are facing as well, and promises to act carefully.\n",
    "Cruise Ship Murder Case (Manga: 227, Anime: 174)": "Toji Samezaki mentions that Heizo and him became friends through kendo and that Heizo would always beat him with ease in kendo matches.\n",
    "Tiger Scroll Case (Manga: 317, 319-321, Anime: 263)": "",
    "Yuki-Onna Murder Case (Manga: 519, 521-522, Anime: 490)": "Heizo solves the case just from what Shizuka told him over the phone. Later on, he gives a hint to Heiji to enlighten his son and allow him to solve the case as well.\n",
    "Unexpected Murder (Manga: 833, Anime: 711)": "In an exceptional move, Heizo calls Otaki and requests him to investigate a case. Otaki asks what the case is about, and Heizo ominously asks whether Otaki believes that vampires exist.\n",
    "Vampire's Mansion (Manga: 834, Anime: 712)": "Otaki, while on the way to Vampire's Mansion, recalls that when Heizo called him, he advised him to take caution and not let vampires suck up his blood. A classmate of his own father, Rikushige Haga came to Heizo as a client to request a detective to be present at the inheritance ceremony of the Torakura mansion.\n",
    "Detective Play Murder Case (Manga: 1129-1133, Anime: TBA)": "Heizo is briefly mentioned by Ginshiro Toyama after Otaki fails to keep two more suspects from dying, the former saying that Heizo could rough him up very badly if he lets any more people die on his watch. Otaki remembers that Heizo actually used to do that back in Otaki's junior years as a detective[3].\n",
    "Non-canon plot overview": "",

    "Relationships analysis": "",
    "Shizuka Hattori": "They appear to have a good relationship. Shizuka is not intimidated by his fierce personality, and he seems to listen to her.\n",
    "Heiji Hattori": "Heizo is proud of his son and seemingly supportive of his aspirations to be a detective. He also knows Heiji very well, which is why he successfully turns Heiji into a bait in the Tiger Scroll Case (this does not mean that Heiji's safety is not important to Heizo; on the contrary, he does not hesitate to place himself between Heiji and the culprit and his several dozen henchmen in order to protect the former in the same case). Heiji, for his part, does not seem to care what his father thinks of him, and addresses him very informally even when they are before a lot of people.\n",
    "Name origin": "His surname stems from Inspector Hattori, a police officer who often cooperates with Detective Shunsaku Kudo of the TV drama Detective Tales, while \"Heizo\" Hasegawa is the main protagonist of Onihei Hanakacho.\n",
    "Quotes": "— Heizo giving some \"tough love\" to his son.\n"
