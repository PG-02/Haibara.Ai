    "Background": "Yamato grew up in a small Nagano village with Yui Uehara. Like most people from the village, he greatly admired police officer and town hero Kuroto Kai, who inspired him and Uehara to join the police.[1] One year before the Furinkazan Case, Yamato chased a parole jumper he believed to be involved with Kai's mysterious death into a mountain, where he got caught in the avalanche that took his left eye and leg.[1] He was missing and believed dead for several days until school friend Taka'aki \"Komei\" Morofushi, also a police inspector, went against orders to track down the criminal and find Yamato.[2] After recovering, he returned to the force and resumed working on solving Kai's death. With the aid of Conan Edogawa and Heiji Hattori the case was finally resolved, and soon afterwards Uehara rejoined the police force as his partner.[1]\n",
    "Personality": "In contrast to other police inspectors like Megure, Sango Yokomizo, and Yamamura, Yamato is shown to be very serious and hard-boiled. He is often short-tempered and has been known to yell at and intimidate suspects.[3] This aspect of his personality causes him to become quite visibly annoyed with Kogoro's ignorance[4] and Yamamura's goofiness.[5] Still, he does have softer spots, though he does not show them often, and there are hints that he is both aware and accepting of Uehara's affection towards him.\nYamato does have a petty rivalry with fellow police detective Koumei, often competing with him to see who can solve a case first.[6] Despite this, they remain very close friends, and Yamato was even willing to run into a burning mansion to save him at one point.[7] Yamato is also aware of Conan's intelligence and is one of few characters who treats him like an adult and equal.[7]\n",

Afterwards, Yamato was found and in the hospital while Morofushi himself got put down into the local police headquarters.

    "Name origin": "Yamato's name comes from Yamamoto Kansuke (山本勘助 ?), the strategist of Takeda Shingen, the famous daimyo who used \"Fūrinkazan\" as his battle slogan. This is even pointed out by Conan during the Red Wall Case.[16]\n",
