    "Background": "",
    "Shiho Miyano": "",
    "Ai Haibara": "",
    "Personality": "Haibara has a calm and cool personality, sarcastic wit, and high intelligence. When she first escaped from the Black Organization, she was cynical and pushed others away. However, Haibara has since 'defrosted' by embracing her new childhood life and has developed strong relationships with the Detective Boys, Agasa, and Ran.\nAs Ai Haibara, she speaks and acts older than she is supposed to be, which results in the Detective Boys referring to her as \"cool\" or \"mature\". This is emphasized by her impressive general knowledge, even in areas without relation with sciences (such as theology or history[14][15]); and on occasion she is so forceful and demanding that she can stun adults several decades above her current physical age into submission. Despite her jaded demeanor, she can be kind and caring, though usually more to animals than people. Haibara tends to be quiet, though this may be due to her caution to keep herself hidden from the Black Organization. She considers Conan and the Detective Boys the first real friends she has ever had, and is even willing to sacrifice herself just to ensure their safety.[16][17]. Indeed, she considers herself as a threat for them, since the Black Organization will most likely eliminate all of them once she is found. That is why she describes herself as \"dangerous and not like the others\"[18]\nHaibara is generally a loner and misses her older sister, Akemi, greatly (in the film Countdown to Heaven, she would call her sister's old apartment just to hear her voice on the voicemail). Her greatest fear is being caught by the Black Organization, and she is especially terrified of Gin and Vermouth. She tries to keep Conan from doing reckless things that may give away their identity, though often she is surprised by his actions which usually result in gaining the information he needs while also keeping their identities secret. However, whenever Conan is reckless in regards to keeping his identity from Ran, Haibara is the one who plans ahead in order to keep him from being revealed. Because she occasionally works overnight on the antidote for the APTX 4869, she tends to be tired quite frequently, causing Conan to call her an \"evil-eyed yawny girl\" on one occasion.[19]\nDespite spending most of her time alone at the lab, Haibara shows excellent understanding of reading people's mind. Examples include Haibara deducing that Ayumi had a crush on Conan, figuring out Conan was about to tell his identity to Ran, or understanding the anger of Kobayashi when confronting Inspector Shiratori. Thanks to this ability, Haibara can remind Conan about the situation and make him act appropriately, not to reveal his identity.\nIn the OVA A Secret Order From London, Haibara reveals to Ayumi that she likes peanut butter and blueberry jelly sandwiches, from her schooldays in America. She has also mentioned that she only make it with \"American peanut butter and jelly exclusively sold in international grocery store\". However, since Professor Agasa caught her eating one of these sandwiches, especially since Haibara was on her part constantly pestering him into eating low-calorie foods only, she had to abandon that habit for a while.[20]\n",
    "Taste for fashion": "Haibara seems to have some interest in fashion, as she has made repeated requests for certain types of accessories, particularly of the Fusae and Prada brands. For instance, when Miwako Sato declares she would do anything for the one who will solve her father's mystery, she asks for Prada's newest handbag model[21]. What's more, in one of the cases, in order to expose the identity of the person who hid the phone cables to cut off communications with the outside world, she was asked by Conan to fake an unbearable appendix pain, which she agreed to after jokingly requesting for a Fusae Brand's wallet for her cooperation. She then started rolling on the floor and screaming for help. The culprit felt like he had no choice but to reveal the cable from his pockets and reconnect the phone to ask for an ambulance.[22] When observing the suspects in a case, what caught her attention was the bag the suspect was carrying. She recognized that the bag was the newest Fusae brand model, and added that it wasn't on sale in Japan yet.[23] She is also seen with a Prada cell phone case in the Mystery Train case.\nHaibara reads 'ComCom' magazine (a name similar to Japan's 'CanCam' fashion magazine).[24] In OVA 11, the Detective Boys wrongly began to suspect Haibara was a child model from America, due to her looks and knowledge of fashion and makeup.\n",
    "Fan of popular stars": "While she generally accompanies her fellow Detective Boys to soccer matches played by the Tokyo Spirits, Haibara herself is a fan of Big Osaka in general and of the player Ryusuke Higo in particular, especially since the latter has likewise abandoned a \"black organization\" (Noir Tokyo) after the team had betrayed him and had remained an outcast in public opinion for a time.[25][26] Haibara also liked to hear Yoko's songs due to the fact that Higo also likes the songs.[27] However, she later deleted all of Yoko's songs because of the rumored date between Yoko and Ryusuke. At the end of the case, she renews her interest in both of them and goes to play soccer with the Detective Boys while singing Yoko's song \"Dandy Lion\".[28] She has also shown an interest in Kabuki and one of the well known kabuki actors, Ichikawa Ebizo, in the episode Conan and Ebizo's Kabuki Juhachiban Mystery. She introduced herself to Ebizo as one of the Detective Boys and Conan's assistant, assuming a more endearing demeanor, which the children noted, during their conversation in the search for Conan.\nIn non-canon, Haibara is a fan of Sannomiya Kazunori, an actor playing a detective role. She was really annoyed and slapped Conan (in a bath house) when he teased her on liking Sannomiya.[29]\n",
    "Abilities and skills": "",
    "Biochemistry": "Shiho/Haibara is a biochemical genius, taking up her parents' research work on APTX 4869 for the Black Organization by the age of thirteen after going to school in America.\n",
    "Medical knowledge": "Shiho/Haibara has demonstrated knowledge of medicine, recognizing the symptoms of Shiratori's subdural hematoma.[30] Using knowledge of osteology, she also is able to deduce a long decayed woman's ambulatory condition.[31] In A Code of Stars and Tobacco case, she recognized the bones of a deceased person, even though the bones are scattered, and she recognized, \"Mandible, humorus, femur,\"\n",
    "Detective skills": "Shiho/Haibara was able to deduce Conan as Shinichi by inspecting the clues left in Kudo residence. She shows sharp observation, keen thinking process and ability to make logical deduction; however, unlike Conan/Shinichi, she often lacks specialized knowledge or experience to make the conclusive argument to solve the case. Moreover, to avoid attention, she stays quiet, which Conan often takes the spotlight. Haibara does not identify herself as a \"mystery freak\" as Conan. In the few cases that Haibara leads the investigation, she shows that she can be a great detective on her own, although this is not her prime speciality. Haibara has also known to read some mysteries like\nAgatha Christie's Hercule Poirot novels and PD James's Cordelia Gray novel but it is not known whether she enjoys the genre.\n",
    "\"Black Organization sense\"": "Shiho has the ability to sense when Black Organization members are around, which she characterizes as their unique \"smell\" or \"pressure\". So far, her sense only detects Black Organization members and not people with malevolent intent generally,[32] however, it doesn't always trigger when Black Organization members are present.[33] nor does it reveal their numbers.[34] Sometimes the sense is fleeting (Subaru, or Shuichi passing by pursuing James Black), or context sensitive (when Akemi was planning the bank robbery).\nIt is also possible that it mostly activates, when she senses danger, and esp. when she is the target. When she first met Kuroda, she appeared frightened, but she explained later that his face was frightening, and was easily backed up by the rest of the Detective Boys. It momentarily activated in Mystery of the Burning Tent, but it was fleeting, and she says that she likes the teacher, and \"Does not want to hear anything bad about her\" to Conan, whose only getting much more suspicious of the teacher. So far, she has not met Wakita, or even seen him.\nTo be truthful, Conan seems to be suspicious of 2, maybe 3 of the new one-eyed people, so maybe her Black Organization sense tranferred to him since those two are primarily interested in him, and not her. In fact, hers may be dissapating, if she feels safe.\n",
    "Pain tolerance": "Like other Black Organization members, Haibara as Shiho has also demonstrated a strong tolerance for pain. During the initial apoptoxin transformation, Shiho does not scream despite the sensation of 'bones melting', as doing so would likely have ended in being caught and killed when someone came to check on her. It is unclear if she even passes out at all, and regardless she manages to recover quickly enough to escape through a chute/ventilation shaft before her captors know anything happened.\nAdditionally, she climbs barefoot up a chimney while extremely sick from the effects of a cold combined with paikaru-induced regrowth. She then crawls back to the chimney after she is shot multiple times by Gin on the frigid, snowy roof. She still maintains consciousness after falling down the chimney over a story in height and experiencing the agony of reverting back to Ai Haibara. Nowhere during this ordeal or her rescue afterwards did she cry from the pain. Shiho also handled the painful side affects of being reverting back to an adult with a prototype antidote better than Shinichi.\n",
    "Shooting": "Shiho/Haibara is familiar with firearms. As Haibara, she was confident enough to intentionally miss a shot with a handgun. Despite the recoil of shooting in her first grade body, it did not seem to effect her in the slightest.[35]\n",
    "Driving": "In The Movie Crossover : Lupin III vs Detective Conan, Haibara is able to ride a Harley motorbike, she stated that she used to own a Harley when she was Shiho.\nIn The Special Episode : Disappearance of Edogawa Conan, she is shown driving a car as Haibara.\n",
    "Football": "Initially Haibara wasn't interested in football, but thanks to Conan she now enjoys watching them and roots for Big Osaka team, with Higo Ryusuke her favorite player. In Movie 16, she performed a long pass through the debris, delivering the ball to Conan for the decisive kick saving the day.\n",
    "Music": "In canon, Haibara has knowledge about classical music. In Movie 12, she played the recorder to send a message to Conan.\n",
    "Art Appreciation": "In her first appearance, she recognized that a teenager's painting was a Picasso painting, helping Conan to figure out the Detective Boys' client's older brother was kidnapped due to his ability to paint fakes of famous paintings, more importantly, Natsume Sōseki on the 1,000 yen bill's portrait.\n",
    "Acting": "In her first case, after she fired a gun, and was about to be reprimanded for it by Megure, she began her crying act. That act continued for the longest time, and the only one stuck walking her home was Conan.\nWhen they were near the Kudo and Agasa's residence, Conan asked her if she can get home by herself now, since her address is somewhere around here, but he did not recall the address, when she told him at school.\nWhen he began to walk away, she immediately stopped the crying act, and transferred into her Black Organization Role of Sherry, but probably more evil than she ever was in the organization, and all she is doing is talking.\nWhen she really introduced herself to him, she did it in a way, where she showed that she can be quite evil, like the rest of the Black Organization, even telling him that Agasa, who is his lifeline to being a detective in his child's body is dead, really freaking him out.\nShe was talking and speaking like so many of her cold-blooded former co-workers, and showed no remorse at all, nor did she break character at all.\nWhen he went to Agasa, he was alive and well, and all three spoke, when she finally stopped acting.\n",
    "Appellations": "Although most people will call Haibara by her name suffixed with -san (due to her personality), and some with -chan (due to her agreement), a lot of the characters have different ways of calling her due to their different relationships. The following is a list of the different appellations for Haibara (and the ones Haibara gives in return) encountered in the series.\n\n",
    "Plot overview": "",
    "Non-canon plot overview": "",
    "Countdown to Heaven (Movie: 5)": "Having greatly missed her sister Akemi, Ai secretly begins to make a call to an apartment that her sister once stayed in order to hear her voice from the tape recorder. Gin and Vodka, knowing about this habit of hers, plan to track down Agasa's phone number when she makes the call, but their plan is foiled by Conan and Agasa after being informed of this by Genta.\nAs she begins to bond with the Detective Boys, Ai begins to realize that she herself is no longer all alone or full of sorrow, and is willing to sacrifice herself to allow them to live. She also witnesses both Genta and Mitsuhiko's bravery of not wanting to leave her behind from the time bombed tower, with the former forcefully carrying her to the escape car despite her intention to countdown the time bomb until the end, and the latter holds on to her when she is thrown off the car due to the blaze from the explosion. Ai, knowing of Ayumi's affection toward Conan, also warns him to never make Ayumi cries, else she'll never forgive him.\n",
    "Relationships analysis": "",
    "Family and friends": "Akemi is Haibara's big sister and the two were very close. The death of Akemi still affected her greatly as it was Akemi's death that prompted Haibara to escape from the organization, as no one would explain the reason behind it. Haibara eventually learned about the robbery Akemi committed before her death, but she suspected there was more to the story. To this day, she still thinks about her sister and greatly misses her\nIn the movie Countdown to Heaven, she kept calling Akemi's number at her apartment just to hear her voice, fully aware that the Black Organization might wiretap and trace to her location. It took extreme measures from Conan to make Haibara abandon this thought.\nDr. Miyano was Haibara's father. He passed away when she was barely a year old. Her feelings toward her father is unknown, but she does show interest in seeing the house where he grew up.\nElena passed away when Shiho was a baby. Even though Shiho/Haibara has accepted her passing for a long time, being able to hear her voice via recorded\ntapes calmed Haibara down.\nBoth are de-aged by APTX4869 and have almost equal levels of intelligence, which makes Haibara and Conan close confidants and more empathetic with each other than most other characters. Conan is one of the few people in front of whom she has shown any signs of weakness, such as breaking down over her sister's death. They share an interesting relationship. They believe and rely on each other. She is keenly observant of Conan's personality, intelligence, and sense of justice.\nIf Conan is in danger, she is willing to throw away her life to save him, overriding fears and concerns for her own safety that would ordinarily paralyze her. Similarly, Conan has saved Haibara's life more than once when she would have sacrificed herself for his and the Detective Boys' safety. She often enjoys teasing Conan, which he takes in good stride. However, he is oblivious of her feelings towards him and sometimes finds it difficult to deal with her sarcasm and impudent, cold nature. Although in empathy on many matters, they don't fully trust one another with information about the Black Organization out of concern for the safety and feelings of the other. In fact, she has always known that Renya Karasuma is the Black Organization head, but she never reveals it for Conan's safety.\nThe relationship between Haibara and Professor Agasa is rather unusual, if not humorous. Despite their actual ages, Haibara often acts more like a mother to the professor, constantly reminding him to watch what he eats. On several occasions, she has removed fattening foods from his reach,[58] and is attempting to help get him into better shape.\nKogoro jokingly notes in Countdown to Heaven that she acts a lot like Agasa's wife.\nThere have also been instances where she'll automatically step in front of Agasa in cases of danger.[59]Out of all the people she's met, Haibara seems most comfortable about acting herself with Professor Agasa; which might be attributed to the fact that he was the one who found her after she escaped the Black Organization, and took her in. Agasa had been an acquaintance of Shiho's parents, but he hadn't imagine that she would be their daughter, before Conan revealed it.\nThere are instances where Haibara will caution Conan from actions that involve Ran, though it's assumed this is due merely to the fact that\nshe wants to keep her identity hidden. Early on, she is cold and distant towards Ran, even more so than she is to most other people. Ran believes that it is because Haibara hated her,[60] though in truth it is because Ran reminds Haibara strongly of her dead sister.\nAfter Ran notices Haibara is not feeling well and carries her to safety during a case, Haibara finally properly introduces herself to Ran, and they slowly became friends. Because Haibara finds that Ran resembles her older sister, Akemi Miyano, she takes special interest in protecting her. These feelings increase after Ran jumps through a slew of bullets from a Black Organization sniper to save Haibara.[61] Haibara immediately thinks of her own sister, and begins acting to try to protect Ran from the organization, such as when Haibara begs for Ran to stay at Agasa's house when she knows that Korn, Chianti, and the rest of the Black Organization are lurking about, immediately thinking of her own sister's death, and wanting to keep Ran safe.[62]\nAssuming that Conan has romantic feelings for Ran, Haibara feels jealous of her and suffer from considering herself as less attractive than Ran. She even implies that Ran would be similar to a dolphin, when she would only be a shark coming from the cold depths of the sea, indicating that she cannot compete against her[63]. Once when Haibara had a cold and Ran came to bring her some food, Ai pretended to be asleep and Conan said she wasn't being considerate for Ran's good actions towards her. Haibara thought to herself that Conan doesn't understand a thing, but she doesn't want him to anyway, hinting that she has actually romantic feelings towards Conan/Shinichi and is jealous due to his feelings for Ran.\nThe first time Subaru appears, Haibara felt a strange feeling toward him and thought he is a member of the Black Organization. However, the feeling kept coming and going. In later episodes, Haibara doesn't seem to hate him so much anymore. She even tries to uncover Subaru's scarf to check his neck, probably suspecting he was using a device made by Professor Agasa. At one point, she asks him if he bugged Agasa's house because he keeps appearing at opportune moments when they're involved in a case, bringing food hastily put together as an excuse for his presence. She cited one instance in which the food was not cooked and the vegetables were raw.\nCurrently, although Akai/Subaru knows Haibara's secret identity, Haibara doesn't know Subaru's identity, nor does she know Akai was her deceased sister's boyfriend. Both Akai/Subaru, Conan, and Agasa are keeping such information a secret from Haibara. At one point, Haibara questions if Akai is a \"lolicon.\"\nHaibara knows Dai Moroboshi as her sister's boyfriend. She deduces that Dai approaches her sister just to collect information about the Black Organization. She remembered him giving her a promise to protect Akemi. But she also remembers him as 'the one, who betrayed the organization', so there is a possibility that she has heard another story of what happened. Later on, she meets a guy similar to him in The Jet-Black Mystery Train and wonders how he got the scar on his face.\nHeiji is one of the few character who know Conan and Haibara's secret identity, as well as the effect of APTX 4869. In general, Heiji and Haibara rarely meet each other. His hot temperament is a trait that Haibara dislikes. However, on more than one occasion, Haibara trusts Heiji to keep the secret of the drug and to keep Conan/Shinichi safe when Conan temporarily reverts back to Shinichi.\nHaibara also shows a mischievous side towards Heiji. At one point when Heiji (not exactly) confessed to Kazuha, Haibara used the recorded speech as her ringtone.\nIn File 1049, the flashback conversations between Vermouth and Mary confirmed that Mary and Elena are sisters. So that Akemi is blood relatives with Akai family.\n",
    "Detective Boys": "Haibara has tried to keep an emotional distance away from the rest of the Detective Boys at the beginning. However, over time, she can't resist their boistorous friendliness anymore and gradually warms up to them. When she was first introduced, she would often stay off to the side of whatever activity the Detective Boys were doing while later arcs, such as the Sweet and Cold Delivery Service arc, open with her playing soccer with them, and even mentally as she's about to do one of Higo's moves.\nOut of the Detective Boys, Haibara is the closest with Ayumi. At one time, Ayumi noticed that she called everyone by their first names except for Haibara and decided to try and call her \"Ai-chan\", but without success. At the end of a case which involved a shattered friendship, Haibara told Ayumi that it was okay for her to call her \"Ai-chan\". When Mitsuhiko and Genta tried to call her that, however, she told them that only Ayumi was allowed to call her by her first name.[64] On the whole, Haibara seems to see Ayumi as a little sister, even going so far as to physically shield her from danger.[65] Besides, Ayumi is one of the people who teach her that she cannot win by always running away, and that she has to face her enemies[66].\nHowever, Haibara and Ayumi may almost be love rivals, since both seem to develop romantic feelings for Conan: Ayumi even asks her if she is in love with him, and is really frightened when she is answered positively (she eventually cheers up when Haibara says she is not).[67]\nHaibara's classmate and fellow detective Mitsuhiko develops romantic feelings for her, and Haibara is fully aware of this. Haibara uses Mitsuhiko's feelings to her advantage when she needs him to do something, but she also admires his intelligence and courage during missions the Detective Boys must perform and respects his feelings. In some episodes she even shows more confidence in Mitsuhiko than in Ayumi or Genta when the going gets tough.\n",
    "Black Organization": "The boss, after Shiho's defection, wants her eliminated as a loose end at almost all costs.\nGin has an abnormal attachment for Shiho, often thinks of her being naked, and seems to enjoy hunting her down, while she hates and fears him. They had some sort of relationship in the past.[68]\nShiho and Vodka have met and are acquaintances.[69]\nVermouth and Shiho have some connection, although it has not been elaborated on. Shiho fears Vermouth more than other Black Organization members except perhaps Gin: in the first times, the feeling of her presence can even entirely paralyze her[70]. Shiho was initially Vermouth's target, but Vermouth promised to give up on her after Conan's intervention.[69] She broke this promise later when Bourbon discovered a video of Sherry, still clinging to her personal conviction that Shiho is the one person who can't be allowed to exist in the world.[71]\nRei knew Haibara's parents and sister. Rei has also met Shiho in the Mystery Train case, but not knowing that it was Kaitou Kid in disguise.\n",
    "Others": "As Haibara tries to wipe out the mascara in her left eye, Conan notices the similarities between her and Mary, and he thinks that they might be blood related. Conan thinks that Haibara is somehow connected to the Akai family.\nMany fans believes that Haibara's mother is the sister of Mary, as Gosho confirmed that two mothers will be revealed as sisters with Mary being one of the sister pair. This was confirmed on chapter 1049.\n",
    "People who know Haibara's real identity": "These people know Haibara's true identity: Professor Agasa, Conan, Vermouth, Pisco, Heiji Hattori, Yukiko Kudo, Yusaku Kudo, and Shuichi Akai. It is also possible that James Black and Jodie Starling of the FBI know Haibara's true identity since they call Haibara by her codename \"Sherry\", although they may not know yet her true name.\n",
    "Gadgets": "Professor Agasa has made many gadgets for Shinichi/Conan to use for investigate cases or catch criminals, and Haibara also uses some gadgets same as conan to use for self defense and help Shinichi/Conan. such as Glasses and wristwatch (Criminal Tracking Glasses, Telescopic Lenses, Stun-Gun Wristwatch, Wristwatch Flashlight) and Detective Boys Badge (use for communicating with Detective boys).\n",
    "Character popularity": "- eBookJapan held a character popularity poll from April 12, 2011 to May 12, 2011 in which readers of Detective Conan (international included) could vote for their favorite character. Haibara placed 4th in the poll with 686 votes out of the 5,883 that were cast.[72]\n- In honor of the release of the 15th movie, Quarter of Silence, the official Conan movie website held a popularity poll for the top 10 Detective Conan characters. Haibara placed 4th out of 10. (First place of all female characters)[73]\n- In honor of the release of the 800th manga chapter, Shonen Sunday held a popularity poll/contest containing 91 Detective Conan characters to choose from.

    "Name origin": "According to Agasa, Ai Haibara's name comes from Cordelia Gray (the character 灰 in her name means \"ash\") and V.I. Warshawski (\"Ai\" comes from the letter \"I\"). Although Agasa suggested she use the kanji 愛 (love) for \"Ai\", she preferred to use the kanji 哀 (sorrow).[76] Her US FUNimation name, \"Vi Graythorn\", has similar roots. However, Gosho Aoyama in an interview posted in the May 2014 issue of Da Vinci magazine stated that the \"Ai\" in Ai Haibara comes from Irene Adler, a character from the Sherlock Holmes story \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", and she is inspired by her.[77][78]\nHer US Viz name, Anita Hailey, comes from:\n- Anita: Anne Katherine Green (the first American Mystery Writer)\n- Hailey: Hero (though Anita didn't care much for the choice)[79]\nHer codename Sherry is Detective Shunsaku Kudo's (from Tantei Monogatari (Detective Tales)) favorite liquor.\n",
