    "Background": "Ethan Hondou was a character featured in the Kir Arc of Detective Conan, which centered around the Hondou family. He was introduced to the storyline as the deceased father of Eisuke Hondou and Hidemi Hondou (later revealed to be Rena Mizunashi and Kir). He was a second generation Japanese-American, which says his parents (or just one of them) might have been Japanese people who moved to USA. He later married an unnamed Japanese woman, who worked as a housekeeper and had two children with her. He was a CIA agent who went into deep cover as a Black Organization member. His daughter Hidemi went overseas to study and Eisuke lived with his mother.\nHe and his son Eisuke at one point lived in Osaka after the death of his wife. He used to eat at an Okonomiyaki restaurant with his CIA colleagues and separately with Eisuke but stopped coming several years ago, presumably because he died or started infiltrating the Black Organization.[1] He left Eisuke in the care of a friend and would send him money every month.\nAfter Ethan went overseas for work, he would send messages to his boss while talking to his son on the phone. Eisuke describes the sound as the melody of Nanatsu no Ko. Learning this, Conan deduced that Eisuke's father was a CIA agent working undercover in the Black Organization. During infiltration his middle man was killed, so his daughter Hidemi, who had joined the CIA as well, went undercover in the organization with the purpose of introducing a new middle man, Barney.\n",
    "Death": "Recognizing that his newly recruited daughter's cover was about to be blown, Ethan committed suicide to protect Hidemi by making it look like she was the one who killed him. He encouraged her to finish the mission in his place and told her to wait for an ally. After he was killed, a colleague from the CIA, Barney, came in the warehouse where he was killed in and started calling him \"Hondou\". This was overheard by Gin, who mentions Barney committed suicide before he could be interrogated, and they burned down the warehouse. This was all witnessed by a homeless man living on the second floor of the warehouse who luckily escaped the fire. Sometime later, Shuichi Akai found the homeless man and found out all these evidence that would be later used to help the FBI.\n",
    "Appellations": "\n",
    "Personality": "Not much is known about Ethan's personality. It can be assumed that he has a strong sense of justice and a deep love for his family, shown when he sacrificed himself for his daughter to continue the mission in his stead without hesitation.\n",
