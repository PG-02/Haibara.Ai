    "Background": "At the beginning of the series, Matsumoto was a superintendent of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department[1][2], and Juzo Megure's superior, often giving him specific instructions on very dangerous cases. Sometimes, Megure puts his plan through to Matsumoto first, and then sees what he has to say about it. He has a scar over his left eye.\nMatsumoto was a minor character and only made limited appearances. His main appearances were his first appearance in the Poisoned Bride Case and in the Scar and Ginger Case when the story behind his scar was explored. In Poisoned Bride Case, Matsumoto's only daughter Sayuri gets poisoned during her wedding. The culprit was the groom, who was attempting to avenge his mother's death by Matsumoto's negligence. They reconciliated and Sayuri recovered. In the Scar and Ginger Case, we learn that Matsumoto got the scar 15 years ago from a katana slash from a serial killer he was chasing. The case was finally closed when the connection between the victims was discovered and the serial killer was identified.\nIn storyline, he was promoted to Senior Superintendent, and replaced by Hyoue Kuroda although his last appearance was much earlier in the Overnight Deadline case. Unlike Matsumoto, Kuroda has a deeper involvement with the plot with a complicated past and a connection with the Black Organization.\n",
    "Personality": "Although Matsumoto looks to be a stern, harsh, brute man, he can be a very kind and gentle person, only getting very angry when a loved one is put in danger. However, his demeanor changes to complete seriousness and professionalism while at work. When one of his people is put in danger, he gets very serious on getting them back.\n",
