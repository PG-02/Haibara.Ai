    "Background": "Little is known about Rei Furuya as a PSB investigator. Most of his appearances are as the Café Poirot waiter and private eye Tooru Amuro or as the Black Organization operative Bourbon.\nRei makes his first appearance as Tooru Amuro when acting as a private detective. He meets Conan and the Mouris while disguised as a waiter to help a client with a case.[5] When Sleeping Kogoro appears to solve a case relating to his client before he can, he claims he wants to learn from Kogoro.[5] Rei succeeds in becoming his apprentice by offering him a hefty tuition fee as an incentive.[5] Thus, he begins working at Café Poirot, right under the Mouri Detective Agency, to remain close to Kogoro.[5] Presently, he continues to work under this cover.\nBourbon is first mentioned when Kir reports that a new Organization member is on the move, intending to capture the escaped scientist Shiho Miyano.[6] Kir reports that Bourbon has excellent information gathering skills and keen insight.[6] However, Bourbon's first actual appearance is when disguised as Scar Akai[7] to determine the veracity of Akai Shuichi's death.\nCurrently, Rei's main appearance as a PSB investigator is during the Scarlet Showdown, when he orders around subordinates during the confrontation with Yusaku Kudo (who was disguised as Subaru Okiya).[8] He additionally gives an order to a PSB subordinate, Yuya Kazami, during The Heartfelt Strap case.[9]\nWhen Rei was 22 years old he attended police academy with Hiromitsu Morofushi, Wataru Date, Jinpei Matsuda and Kenji Hagiwara.\nRei was the top student at the police academy.\nAll five friends graduate together.\n",
    "Childhood": "Rei is confirmed to be half-Japanese. When he was a child, he often got into fights with other children because he was bullied for his mixed ethnicity. Whenever this happened he would get bandaged up by Elena Miyano. At one point, she told him that she had to move far away and would not be able to bandage him up again. Because of his affiliation with Elena, he also met Akemi Miyano, Elena's first child, as a kid as well. Because of his affiliation with Elena, he also met Akemi Miyano, Elena's first child, as a kid as well. The extent of their relationship is not yet revealed. As a child, Rei had the nickname \"Zero\". In a chapter in Zero's tea time, Elena seems to be the one who taught him how to ride a bike.\nAs a child, Rei had the nickname \"Zero\", based on his first name and given to him by his childhood friend Hiromitsu Morofushi.\n",
    "Black Organization": "Since joining the Black Organization, Rei has always considered Shuichi Akai as a worthy rival, he wants to compare his capacity with Shuichi and thinks he is the only one who could defeat Shuichi. Shuichi always shows respect towards Rei, he admits Rei's capability and feels interested every time he faces Rei, he also makes Rei feel quite confused sometimes. Their relationship becomes more bitter and dramatic when Rei misunderstands and assumes that Shuichi killed his best friend - Scotch, but in actuality, the one who indirectly caused Scotch to die was Rei himself. Shuichi chooses to keep this a secret and continues to let Rei misunderstand him instead of letting Rei know that painful truth. Over time, Shuichi appears to help and protect Rei in some cases, as he gradually wants to compensate for the losses which Rei has experienced as he doesn't want to be Rei's enemy. For now, it seems that Rei is temporarily lowering his hatred to work alongside with Shuichi and Conan in destroying the Black Organization.\nVermouth and Bourbon keep close contact with one another and seem to be closer to one another than, say, Bourbon and Gin. Bourbon specializes in intelligence gathering, so he likely belongs to the same reconnaissance division of the Black Organization as Vermouth. While it is still uncertain whether Bourbon is working directly under Vermouth, she seems to keep track of his actions during his missions at times,[60] and he also often informs her about his discoveries or his plans.[61] Vermouth helped Bourbon create a disguise that looked like Akai so he can investigate his enemy's death. Later, she somehow helped him approach Kogoro because he suspected that the detective was in contact with Sherry. Bourbon made a promise to Vermouth not to let any harm comes to Conan and Ran no matter what happens, and she calls to ask him if he will be upholding it after the car chase in Detectives' Nocturne.\nThe two have shown to be working together, not unlike Gin and Vodka, though the bond and trust between them are somewhat lacking. In addition to Bourbon's promise to Vermouth, he is also aware of her secret relationship with the boss, as noted at the end of the Scarlet Showdown. Bourbon utilizes this information to enlist Vermouth's assistance in his investigations, arranging for her secret to be released to the other members of the Organization if he is killed by her.\nRei was probably close with Elena Miyano as a child before she died. Elena would doctor Rei after he got into fights. She is also aware of his true name, calling him \"Rei-kun, however, this is shown to be before her husband went to work for the Carasuma Group when she was 3 months pregnant for Miyano Shiho/ Haibara Ai/ Sherry.\"\nIn wild police story, Rei revealed that he joined the police academy in order to find Elena who has disappeared without his knowledge. He even calls her she was very dear to him.\nGin dislikes Bourbon's personality and finds him annoying for being secretive and always doing what he pleases. At the same time, Gin respects Bourbon's detective abilities. The two do not seem to be in contact with one another, as Gin has no idea what Bourbon is doing.\nAkemi Miyano and Rei seem to have met at some point because Akemi told Shiho that Bourbon has a rivalry with Akai. The moment where they met for this time, although not specified if it was, in the flashback of The Unsolved Cocktail Case, they are shown together when a younger Akemi tries to bring Rei to her mother's office to heal up his wounds.\nRei doesn't seem to have any hostility towards Shiho unlike other Black Organization members. He attempted to capture the person he thought was alive instead of trying to kill her, regretting he might have to resort to violence to do so. Rei says he had met Elena and Atsushi Miyano while they were alive. Rei does not know Shiho is Ai. During a car chase in Detectives' Nocturne‎, Shiho gets a strong feeling that a member of the Black Organization was behind her, but she doesn't seem to pinpoint it to Rei's pursuing Mazda FD RX-7.\n",
    "Personality": "Rei has a cheerful personality. He is also generous, bringing a plate of sandwiches for the detective agency bought with his money. In more serious situations, he seems to be patient, keeping calm even while others are abusing him. Although somewhat of a \"cool type\", he does not hide his emotions and is quite expressive. Like other detectives in Detective Conan, he enjoys presenting his deductions about cases to others. Kogoro calls him \"effeminate\".\nRei has a darker side. He is manipulative, tricking others into performing certain actions so he can gather information. He favors using psychological traps and catching his enemies off-guard. Rei can also be extremely cruel in the pursuit of goals. He planned to run over and hospitalize an elementary school teacher with his car to lure out FBI agents, and he would have allowed a suspect to destroy his exonerating evidence to test Kogoro. Rei alternates between going out of his way to care about the well-being of others and ignoring them when it is inconvenient. As Scar Akai, he saved Conan at the Teito bank heist but neglected to inform Ran and Kogoro later when he noticed that Conan might have been kidnapped by a murderer in Detectives' Nocturne.\nGin says Bourbon has a secretive personality like Vermouth, and that no one can ever guess what he's up to or what he will do.[15] Vodka says that Bourbon hates Shuichi Akai even more than Gin does, presumably because Rei thinks that Akai killed Scotch.[15] Bourbon believes he is the only person capable of killing Akai.[15] Gin said that if Bourbon found out Akai was alive, he would surely boast that his suspicion was correct.[15] Gin and Bourbon probably don't get along and they don't seem to communicate with one another.[15]\nDespite his darker side he still has a true Japanese true spirit. He shows humanity even toward an enemy. For example, in Zero's Tea Time Chapter 12, he wanted to make Camel leave to not get into traffic. In chapter 34 he practices with him, and in chapter 44, when Camel saved chief, he thanked him and prepared a glass of water which impressed Camel. Rei is also a gentleman like Takagi, as stated by his friend Wataru date.\n",
    "Appearance": "Rei is a good-looking man (claimed by Sonoko and Ayumi) with dark skin, lighter than, but closer to Heiji's color and has light blonde hair. He wears glasses at first, but it is unknown if he needs them because he was using them to conceal his identity at the time and takes them off midway through the case and has not had them on since. Unlike other Black Organization members, he mostly dresses casually in little black.\n",
    "Abilities": "",
    "Intelligence": "Rei is a good detective with excellent information-gathering skills. He is noted by Kir as a threatening member of the Black Organization with keen insight.[6] As Rei remains undercover as Kogoro's apprentice, he is not as flashy in showing his true deduction skills, instead leading Kogoro with hints to reach conclusions. His friend, Wataru Date, said Rei was the smartest student at the police academy.[16] He claimed that he always knew that Akai was an 'FBI Dog,' which shows that he may have the observation skills to detect fellow NOCs, who infiltrated the Black Organization. From his investigations, he was able to determine that Conan was the puppeteer behind Sleeping Kogoro. His observation skills also allowed him to see that Conan planned everything in Akai's Fake Death instance, including the conclusion of his sentence, stating that Conan predicted everything perfectly as it played out at Raiha Pass.[17]\n",
    "Driving": "Rei is a capable driver, capable of precisely swinging his car in front of another during a high-speed car chase to stop it with a controlled collision.[18] In movie 22, Zero the Enforcer, his awesome (but also crazy) driving skills are revealed better.\n",
    "Martial arts": "Rei is good at boxing,[19] shown when a single punch to an attacker's gut causes him to spray blood from the mouth and collapse.[20] At his introductory case, Rei displayed agility as he swiftly dodged a swinging punch from a customer. Later, he easily dodged multiple punches from an ex-professional kickboxer while protecting Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya. Rei also likely knows some Jujutsu from his time in the police academy; Jujutsu is routinely taught to Tokyo police officers to aid in suspect immobilization and arrest. Wataru Date said Rei was the strongest student at the police academy.[16]\n",
    "Cooking": "Rei is noted to be a good chef and baker in his work at Poirot as Hiromitsu taught him some cooking skills.[21] He often invents new recipes for the café, perfecting them to the point where Conan often jokes that he is taking his waiter job too seriously.[22]\n",
    "Other skills": "Rei is an excellent tennis player. He claimed he was a junior champion in middle school, but quit after he injured his shoulder.[23] He is proficient in first aid as when Conan received a concussion from an errant tennis racket, Rei \"carried out the procedures pretty efficiently\" before the doctor even arrived.[24] He is a proficient lockpicker. Rei has pro-level guitar skills.[25] He has a high capability to ski and even replaced Kogoro Mouri for professional ski lessons in Gunma. He can easily do off-track skiing also and jump off cliffs to save lost people.[26] In the non-canon movie The Darkest Nightmare, he was able to defuse a bomb and he remembered Jinpei Matsuda who taught him that. In Wild Police Story manga he was able to defuse a bomb with Matsuda's help.\n",
    "Appellations": "\n",
    "Mission": "Bourbon's primary mission was to search for the escaped scientist Shiho Miyano, which the CIA spy Kir heard about and informed the FBI of. He also had a second secret mission fueled by his hunch that his archenemy Shuichi Akai should not have died so easily;[15] he received the boss' permission to verify Shuichi's death. He approached the FBI as  a Shuichi lookalike by using Vermouth's disguise help hoping to see if Akai was truly dead.[49] He later apprenticed himself to Kogoro Mouri because Bourbon suspected the detective may be connected to Sherry.[50] (Kogoro was previously suspected of being linked to Sherry because the tracker, microphone, and gum combo Gin found on Kir's shoe after the Ding Dong Dash case was the same style as the one Gin discovered in his car and assumed that Sherry planted it).\nCurrently, Bourbon thinks Shiho has been killed,[51] and had come to believe Shuichi was dead as well until a suspicious man shrouded by smoke threw a grenade by him on the Mystery Express.[52] The sighting caused Bourbon to second guess himself and request that Vermouth show him the detailed files from before and after Shuichi's death again.[52] Bourbon has also decided to continue as Kogoro's apprentice because he noticed Conan is the real brains behind \"Sleeping Kogoro\" and is curious.[50]\nOne of the most important missions of Bourbon, however, is implied that he infiltrates and undermines the Black Organization like Kir. Shuichi Akai has revealed that Rei has been persevering to turn in Shuichi to the organization to earn higher ranks to approach more closely to the boss.\nAfter the Shinichi Kudo's uproar has been calmed down by the blogger who claims that the Shinichi he saw was an illusion, and Heiji Hattori who claims that the one they saw was Soshi Okita instead, Rum sends an email to Bourbon giving him his new mission; to gather information about Shinichi Kudo, telling him to hurry up stating that \"Time is money\". Bourbon eventually accepts his new mission.\n",

    "National Police Association": "Rei attended police academy with Hiromitsu Morofushi, Wataru Date, Jinpei Matsuda, and Kenji Hagiwara. According to Wataru Date, Rei was always ranked first in his year. Following his graduation, he went on to join the Public Security Bureau as a member of the Zero division, and at some point received the assignment to become an undercover agent in the Black Organization along with Hiromitsu.\n",

    "Hints that Amuro was Bourbon": "- The character Tooru Amuro is named after, Amuro Ray, is the mortal enemy of the character Shuichi Akai is named after, Char Aznable.\n- He is a detective and very skilled at information gathering as Kir described.\n- He is male as the codename Bourbon implies. The Black Organization codename pattern is that hard liquors are used for men's codenames, and Kir used a male specific pronoun to refer to Bourbon in the Department Store Bomber Case.[53]\n- He has a type of personality Gin would not like. Gin thinks Bourbon is irritating.[54]\n- When Rei offers Kogoro an unknown \"tuition\" per case Kogoro brings him on, the amount he offers is enough to get Kogoro excited and accept Rei as an apprentice without hesitation. This is strange because Rei would not be expected to have much money because he is young, lacks a formal agency, and works part-time at restaurants in one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in.\n- Unlike other detectives so far, Rei is a calculating type who chose avoidable courses of action (or non-action) that may have resulted in harm to others if things had gone slightly differently. In his introductory case, Rei doesn't intervene when a suspect he knows to be innocent is half a step from destroying his exonerating evidence because it seems Rei was testing Kogoro. Later, Rei noticed that Conan was alone with a murderer and considered that Conan might have been kidnapped, yet said nothing about it until others realized Conan and the murder suspect were gone.\n- The timing of Bourbon's report to Vermouth about Shiho's appearance at Gunma suggested Rei was Bourbon. The other two Bourbon suspects, Subaru and Masumi, both had seen Haibara and were suspicious of her long before Bourbon reported Shiho to Vermouth, but the video from Gunma was the first time Rei had seen an image of Shiho or Haibara. Subaru had met Haibara in person in his first appearance case and multiple times afterward. Masumi had obtained a picture of Haibara via a reflection from Agasa's glasses in the Ayumi kidnapping case. Both of them should have reported to Vermouth if they were Bourbon soon after their respective encounters.\n- He completely cut off communication with his close friend Wataru Date. A complete cutoff would not be necessary if Rei worked for a non-secret organization like the Tokyo Metropolitan Police District. It is more sensible that Rei was trying to protect Date from any potential dangers associated with infiltrating the Black Organization as a member of the National Police Agency Security Bureau Security Planning Division.\n- Rei kept a bug detector with him - only Organization members have been shown to do this, while normal detectives like Conan do not.\n- In 667, the first case in which appears Rei, the detective Sanji Haruoka orders the waiter (Rei himself) to bring him the Bourbon with ice.\n- Amuro is the most likely suspect of the three (Subaru, Masumi, Amuro) to be Bourbon via the process of elimination. Subaru Okiya is not Bourbon, as Conan, who is normally a very careful person, invites him to stay as his Shinichi's home. If Subaru was someone that Conan did not know, it would be very unlikely that Conan would let him live in the Kudo's house and near Haibara (Sherry). Masumi Sera who looks like Shuichi Akai is most likely a relative of the FBI agent and thus not an enemy. She also knew Conan was Shinichi, and thus must have deduced that shrinking was possible. Despite knowing this, Haibara was not threatened until her adult form was captured on video before the mystery train case.\n- Of the three major suspects, only Amuro isn't particularly interested in Conan at first. Instead, he kisses up to Kogoro. There was no reason for a member of the Black Organization to care about Conan since all the blame for Conan's prior meddling has fallen on Sherry, Kogoro, the FBI, or an unknown person. The other two suspects, Subaru and Masumi, either was interested in or knew Conan's true identity from the outset.\n- In the Mystery train case, before the reveal, when smoke had began being emitted, he opened a door, and claimed that he saw, \"FIRE,\" when he knew there was no Fire at all.\n- It should probably be mentioned that the fact Rei found out about Conan's intelligence levels and observational skills, as well as his clear detective mastery, but yet was unable to connect him to Yusako Kudo at all as possibly being Shinichi, implies that the side effect of APTX 4869 is not well known, and possibly is only known about by Vermouth and Sherry at the moment, with the possible exception of the boss. This theory is supported by the fact Vermouth wants Sherry dead to some unknown level, as it eliminates more evidence of the drug's side effect, making this theory highly likely. Even before the Bourbon Reveal, he began realizing how intelligent Conan was, and probably that he was more intelligent and observant than Kogoro, however his focused remained on Kogoro, until Conan was hit with the Tennis Racket, and he began really watching and observing Conan.\n",
    "Hints that Scar Akai was Tooru Amuro/Bourbon": "While Scar Akai was played by Vermouth during the last appearance on the train, Bourbon had been Scar Akai during the three earlier appearances at Teito Bank, Beika Department Store, and outside Mouri Detective Agency.[55] The evidence that Rei being Scar Akai these times was:\n- In Scar Akai's appearance at the Beika Dept. Store, Rei was the only known Black Organization operative not seen at the same time as Scar Akai. Gin began discussing Bourbon with Kir after seeing this Scar Akai.\n- Rei was absent from his job at the Poirot when Scar Akai appeared outside the detective agency where Masumi was walking with Ran. This is also notable because this occurred right after Masumi and Rei met and Rei found out Masumi was friends with Ran.\n- In Scar Akai's appearances at the Teito Bank case, the Beika Dept Store, and outside Mouri Detective Agency, he never spoke in front of anyone who would know Shuichi's real voice, suggesting that this Scar Akai could not imitate voices like Vermouth and Kaito kid.\n- Rei is right-handed like Scar Akai.\n- He has the right body size, face shape, and height to disguise as Scar Akai.\n- He has an interest in the Mouri Detective Agency which makes sense because Scar Akai saw fit to keep Kogoro's cellphone number with him.\n- Rei's hypothetical disguise suggestion in 795, a knit cap and long windbreaker, are articles of clothing Shuichi Akai and Scar Akai wear respectively.\n",
    "Hints that Tooru Amuro was a NPA undercover agent": "- Tooru attended the police academy and was close friends with police officer Wataru Date. Amuro cut off contact with Date to protect him from the Black Organization's investigation while infiltrating. Tooru later paid his respects at the grave of detective Wataru Date.[56]\n- Tooru reacted negatively to the presence of the FBI investigating illegally in Japan. He told them to \"get out of his Japan\" because they were infringing on his and the PSB's jurisdiction.\n- Tooru was able to amass several assistants to help him capture the person he thought was Shuichi Akai despite not having the backing of the Black Organization with his plan. The assistants were members of the National Police Agency Security Bureau Security Planning Division.\n",
    "Relationships analysis": "",
    "Family and friends": "Hiromitsu Morofushi and Rei Furuya have been best friends since childhood. Rei helped him overcome the suffering of Aphasia due to his parents' deaths.[57] He also teaches Rei some cooking skills [58] and how to play the guitar. They attended the police academy together, along with Date, Hagiwara, and Matsuda. He works undercover as an undercover agent in the Black Organization under the codename Scotch, along with Rei. However, Hiromitsu got killed undercover. His death appears to be caused by Shuichi Akai, which is the reason behind Rei's vendetta against him and puts a much deeper perspective on Rei's hatred toward Akai.\nWataru Date and Rei Furuya were friends in the police academy; Rei was the top-ranked student, while Date held second place. While Date went on to become an officer, Rei went somewhere else and fell out of contact with Date for unknown reasons. Date's last text to Rei asked him where he was and chided Rei to communicate once in a while. Rei was shown visiting Date's grave, and likely left a toothpick out of respect for Date; Date used them habitually.\nDate had called Rei for a gentleman like detective Takagi.\nJinpei Matsuda and Rei Furuya were friends in the police academy. At first of Wild Police Story, they fight with each other but then became close friends. During the investigation of the culprit related to Hiromitsu's parents' case, Jinpei taught Rei how to deactivate a bomb because his hand was injured.\nIn The Darkest Nightmare, Jinpei was recounted by Rei that he is the one to teach him how to deactivate a bomb.\nKenji Hagiwara and Rei Furuya were friends in the police academy. Gosho also stated that Hagiwara is the one who taught Rei his driving skills.\nRei seems to respect Conan's intelligence and also seems to look out for Conan as well before he attached himself to the Mouri Detective Agency as Kogoro's \"apprentice\" (Aliases as Tooru Amuro). He wound up protecting Conan while disguised as Scar Akai at the Teito Bank, and as Rei helped Conan get out of a kidnapping situation and doctored him when Conan took a racket to the head. Conan initially treats him in a somewhat friendly manner, though he privately thinks \"another annoying person has shown up\" when he learns Rei will be joining Kogoro on cases. However, after he finds out Amuro's membership in the Black Organization, though, Conan has been relatively nervous about him being near Ran. This was made even worse when Rei caught him attempting to tranquilize Kogoro, but due to Rei's attentiveness, he was unable to and had to give hints to Kogoro instead. Although Amuro may not have seen the trick, he became convinced that Conan was the puppeteer behind Sleeping Kogoro, and began investigating Conan, which only made Conan more nervous of him. Their relationship later seemed to improve in The Scarlet Return when Conan learns that Rei is an undercover operative from the Japanese Secret Police when the two exchange smiles in Café Poirot. Conan even used his Voice Changing Bow Tie in front of Rei in The Heartfelt Strap.\nWhen Shinichi Kudo is exposed on the media due to Kyoto Field Trip, he receives an email from Rum, ordering him to gather information about Shinichi. After he helped to solve the Bunny Girls Case, Amuro broke into the Kudo home, so that he can find out information about Kudo Shinichi. He had the altercation with an unmasked Akai, and both of Shinichi's parents turned on the light, so that the four of them can have a meeting. Currently, it is unknown what was discussed in that meeting, other than Conan planned it.\nIt seemed to become strained again in the movie: Zero the Enforcer, however that is due to Amuro had his subordinate, Yuya Kazami of the Japanese Secret Police- Public Security Bureau, plant phony incriminating evidence against Kogoro Mouri for a bombing incident. However, it turns out that the framing was to use Conan as a Collaborator and to rely on his strength so that Conan can do what he was unable to do for his investigation. This way, he was able to use Conan as a Collaborator and to rely on his strength.\nRei tends to act ingratiatingly whenever Kogoro Mouri is around, and is especially fawning over his \"Mouri-sensei\". Kogoro is alternatively flattered by Rei's praise and annoyed with his effusive personality. Overall Kogoro tends to treat Rei flippantly despite being paid a handsome sum for the apprenticeship. When among members of the Black Organization, Rei doesn't speak too badly of Kogoro despite Kogoro's obvious incompetence. Rei is becoming more skilled at herding Kogoro through cases without having the older man realize that Rei is a far superior detective and is manipulating him for information.\nYuya Kazami is Rei's direct subordinate who first appeared in the movie 20,The Darkest Nightmare. Recently, he has officially appeared in the manga, as Rei's subordinate as well.\nIt was revealed in Movie 22 that Kuroda is Zero/Rei's superior in the Public Security Bureau. It was shown when he received orders from him through a phone call. Kuroda is also aware of his involvement with the Black Organization; addressing him by his codename \"Bourbon\".[59]\n",
    "Others": "Rei first saw Masumi at a train station four years ago. He approached Hiromitsu (under the aliases Scotch) while he was teaching Masumi several notes on a bass guitar. It is unknown whether he saw that she was connected to Shuichi at that time.\nMuch later when Conan gets kidnapped by a murderer they cross each other's paths again. After both of them save Conan, he becomes very surprised to see her and wonders why she is there and presumably notices that she looks similar to Shuichi Akai. The next day Rei takes the day off from his job at Poirot cafe. To confirm his theory, Rei once again disguises himself as Scar Akai to gauge her reaction. Suddenly, Masumi sees him in the crowd ahead, and just like Jodie and Camel, Masumi becomes just as shocked by his appearance. She runs after him, but he disappears before she can catch him. Ran wonders who Masumi was chasing, but Masumi replies she thought it was someone she knew. Masumi silently appends in her mind that it would be impossible for the man she was chasing to be the person she thinks it was. While Rei watches her from a little ahead, confirming his suspicion that Masumi is related to Akai.\nDuring The Unfriendly Girls Band, Masumi recalls a time that she saw her brother in a train station four years ago with Hiromitsu (under the aliases Scotch), who taught her the basics of a bass guitar. Masumi believes that the man who approached them at that time wearing a hat that hid his face must have been Rei. However, each time she asks him if they have met before, he avoids the question. When she announces aloud that her brother's name is Shuichi Akai, Rei inwardly comments that her brother had killed Scotch.\nDespite his hatred toward Akai, it doesn't seem like he is letting it cloud his judgment toward Masumi.\nAfter Rei comes to work at the Café Poirot with his alias Tooru Amuro, he and Azusa develop a simple professional friendship and see each other as ordinary colleague. A recurring joke or misunderstanding throughout the series is that others assume they’re a couple. However, when this assumption is made, they both deny it with embarrassment or insist that they’re just colleagues.\n",
    "Speculation": "Gin has revealed that Bourbon is as secretive as Vermouth. Bourbon has shown a friendly relationship with Vermouth but not with other members so far. Bourbon even hid some details from Conan. It is possible that Bourbon, as well as Kir, is a member who doesn't like the Organization. Date himself revealed that Bourbon was the best man at the police academy and that Bourbon was a gentleman like Takagi, too. Besides, at the end of Takagi's Kidnapping Case, Bourbon refers to Date as \"my friend\", which means he had no option but to cut all means of contact with him for his safety.\n",
    "Name origin": "Tooru Amuro has a Mobile Suit Gundam inspired name. He is named after the main protagonist Amuro Ray, and Amuro's voice actor Tohru Furuya.[62] Amuro is also played by Furuya in the animated series. His real name, Rei Furuya, shares the same source.\n",
