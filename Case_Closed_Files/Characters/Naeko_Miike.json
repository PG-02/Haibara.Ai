    "Background": "Naeko Miike is a childhood friend of Kazunobu Chiba and Sakurako Yonehara. They all attended Teitan Elementary together where Kazonobu and Naeko both joined the school broadcasting committee (although Naeko only joined because Chiba did). She then moved after her sixth-grade summer. She works in the traffic department of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police District directly under Yumi Miyamoto.\n",
    "Appearance": "Naeko is a light-skinned and fairly tall woman. Furthermore, she has big upward slanted blue eyes. She also has average-length black hair, with some hair points sticking out on her face. She loves to style her hair as pigtails. She usually appears wearing policewomen's clothes.\n",
    "Personality": "Naeko is an extremely hardworking girl who bears a great dedication to her work. However, she also possesses the notable trait of being very shy, which has ruined many of her chances to confess to Kazunobu Chiba about her true identity as his former classmate as well as her feelings for him. A running gag consists of Naeko always hiding her face and blushing heavily when she sees Kazunobu Chiba. She also has a friendly streak, in which she befriended her senior, Yumi Miyamoto, soon after she recently transferred to the latter's Division as well as Miwako Sato a short time after that. It is implied that she is quite observant, as shown when she noted and told Sato that Wataru Takagi was quite popular amongst women (though withholding the information from Sato herself that Takagi's popularity did not come close to matching the level of Sato's own impact around men).\n",
    "Abilities": "While yet to be confirmed in the manga, it is revealed in episode 918 that Naeko is well-trained in martial arts, She was able to perform a throw, as she lifted a suspect with her hand and put him down knocking him out.\nNaeko sings very well.

Naeko wrote her response on the side of a VHS in the committee storage room, hoping Chiba's sweating habit would cause the message \"I like you, too\" to show up on his hands after grabbing the tape. Unfortunately, Chiba couldn't find the right tape and never got the message.\nOn the day of his elementary school reunion, Chiba returned to the school and searched for the tape again. With the help of Conan and the Detective Boys, he finally finds the message and heads for the reunion. Unfortunately, Naeko doesn't show up, and he hears from a former classmate that she said she is \"now with the one she loved\". Depressed, Chiba immediately leaves and finds a lady traffic cop giving him a ticket. When the officer offers to forget about the ticket since he is a fellow officer, Chiba scolds her for offering to ignore Chiba's illegal parking. Chiba leaves with the ticket but then wonders how the girl knew he was a detective. The officer turns out to be Naeko, who has just been transferred to the police headquarters in Tokyo (working under Yumi) and looks forward to working with the one she loves.\n",

Ironically, one of the victims happens to be Chiba himself. Naeko hides behind Yumi and continues to blush in front of him. However, Chiba remains oblivious to the fact that she is his childhood first love. She is forced into investigating the car cases with Chiba as Ayumi's, Mitsuhiko's and Genta's plan to get them to confess their love to each other. Soon after, a crash occurs and they find a man on the floor with another threat in the person's car. While everybody is investigating the current act of vandalism, Naeko helps out by giving information on the other cases. Meanwhile, Ayumi, Mitsuhiko and Genta continue to get Chiba to realize who Naeko really is, but he gets distracted by Conan, who keeps finding more evidence and Yumi who won't allow Chiba to steal her latest friend from her. Chiba comes close to finding out when a gust of wind blows Naeko's hat off but is interrupted. Naeko feels like he doesn't remember her at all and calls him a dummy. Naeko continues to help with the investigation and they are able to find the culprit. Soon after Naeko takes Chiba home when Chiba remembers that he's seen her before. Naeko, thinking that he realizes she's his first love, is about to say that Chiba is correct when he says that it was from the time where she gave him a parking ticket.

Later at the police station, she teases Sato about the possibility of Takagi travelling to meet Sato's parents to ask for her hand and introduces herself to Sato again when the latter forgets her name (much to her dismay). She voices out that she does not believe Takagi is committing a love affair when the trio discusses the reason behind his visit as he clearly stated that it was not a date and asks about Wataru Date when Yumi and Sato mention the deceased police officer, to which she also considers the possibility Takagi visiting Date's parents.

The female police officers feel disappointed and say they do not interested in him anymore and that relieves Naeko.\n",
