    "Background": "Heiji is a high school detective, and the son of Heizo Hattori, chief of the Osaka Police Department, and his wife Shizuka Hattori. Heiji wants to be a detective like his father since spending his childhood looking for lost cats in his neighborhood, and he is also very skilled in kendo and has become a favored tournament contender for his school.\nAt one time during their childhood, Heiji had had the unfortunate idea of locking himself and his friend Kazuha together with a set of old handcuffs which had no key to unlock it; as a result they involuntarily had to spend time together even on some rather intimate occasions (i.e., bathroom visits) before the cuffs could be removed. As a reminder of this 'closeness' and for good luck, Kazuha fashioned two identical lucky charms, each incorporating a chain link from the cuffs, which she and Heiji have been wearing ever since.[5]\nIn the news, Heiji has been publicly declared the \"Great Detective of the West\", while Shinichi Kudo is the \"Great Detective of the East\". As a result, Heiji showed up unannounced at the Mouri Detective Agency looking for Kudo, seeking to challenge his rival to a showdown of wits. (In fact, they had such a contest before, three years previously, during a skiing trip in the Yamagata prefecture, although they never learned about each other's identities at that time.[6]) Heiji was soundly defeated in the following case after Conan Edogawa temporarily turned back into Shinichi, but he gained a lot of respect for Shinichi in the process.[7]\nDuring their second encounter, Conan knocked Heiji out to use him as the mouthpiece for the voice-changing bow-tie. But during his final presentation of the facts, Heiji awoke prematurely and discovered Conan's secret, and in the end managed to blackmail Conan into revealing all.[8] Ever since that revelation, Heiji has been helping Conan in hiding his secret identity, though he constantly slips up by calling him \"Kudo\" in front of Ran and Kazuha.\nHeiji and Conan most often congenially team up to solve assorted cases. Heiji has also helped Conan investigate his arch-enemy, the Black Organization, on several occasions, such as when the two investigated Jodie Starling[9], or when Heiji investigated Eisuke Hondou on his own and then told Conan his findings[10], but he never had a real direct confrontation with the primary antagonist and often underestimated them. He has also helped cover for Conan during several of the brief instances where Conan regained his true adolescent age, and has even disguised himself as Shinichi on several occasions in order to protect his identity, even though he is not very good at it (mostly owing to his distinctive Kansai dialect). When not working on a case, he regularly attempts to invite Conan to take in the sights and culinary delights of Osaka, which he considers more wholesome than Tokyo's.\n",
    "Personality": "Unlike Shinichi/Conan, more cold and determined, Heiji is very blunt during an investigation, which usually lands him in trouble. Even while solving a case, he tends to be lighthearted and good-humored, preferring to work through it with a grin on his face. He is a big fan of baseball, and is most of the time shown wearing an Osaka cap, to support the local Osaka baseball team. He usually wears his cap with its visor pointed backward, but if he feels challenged, he turns the visor forward.\nHeiji is known for his pride as an Osaka citizen and for his thick Osakan accent, which has been pointed out and sometimes made fun numerous times. However, Heiji holds his head high and is always one to brag about the greatness of Osaka, especially when Conan comes to visit.\nDespite him knowing the value and necessity of remaining calm in the face of a crime, Heiji tends to be impulsive at times, which tends to cloud his judgment a little. This was discussed directly in the \"Detective Koushien\" case, when Saguru Hakuba accused Heiji of being a poor detective for disrupting a crime scene in his rush to see if the victim could still be saved. Heiji, however, solved the case in the end, and reminded Saguru that the detective's first job is to prevent death if he can. Heiji is also known to be extremely protective of those he values as close friends, and tries hard to keep them out of harm. There are several instances where Hattori tells Kazuha to wait for him or leaves her behind in order to keep her from being involved in cases, simply because he's afraid of her getting hurt.[11][12][13]\nFurthermore, he's pretty much always watching Shinichi's back, and does whatever he can to not only keep Shinichi safe, but to keep his identity under cover. However, on one occasion Heiji advised Conan to tell the truth, when Ran had convinced herself that Conan was Shinichi and thus willingly gave him blood after being shot.\nHeiji occasionally enjoys teasing Shinichi's kid form. He has fun jokingly (sometimes mistakenly) calling Conan \"Kudo\" in front of Ran at his friend's expense. He often treats Conan/Shinichi as a younger brother and their close relationship even evokes Kazuha's jealousy from time to time. In return Conan truly trusts and respects Heiji.\nAlthough he is very competitive when it comes to detective cases, when a case gets hot, he and Shinichi work effectively together. During Shinichi's first return to his high school during the play performance, Heiji had let him take the lead role in the investigations, saying that it was because they were in Tokyo, Shinichi's turf.[14]\nAlthough he frequently mocks Kazuha for her superstitions and enthusiasm for good-luck charms, Heiji has several times revealed that he puts more trust in them than he would admit. He once dreamed of Shinichi being murdered, and out subsequently insisted that Conan wear his omamori, the good luck charm Kazuha gave him. The omamori ended up saving Shinichi's life by deflecting a knife blow, but Heiji, without his usual protection, was shot in the stomach.[15] In another case, Ran hung a teruterubozu, a charm that's supposed to ensure good weather, in the window so that Conan would have good weather for his field trip the next day. Heiji, however, got up in the middle of the night to take down the teruterubozu so that Conan's field trip would be rained out and he could accompany Heiji on an investigation of the The Red Horse Among The Flames.[16]\nDuring the \"Bond of Fire\" case, Heiji questions Conan if they were right in stopping the culprit from committing suicide, leading to the latter responding that if a detective knows a criminal is about to commit suicide and does nothing to stop it, then the detective is no better than a murderer. Heiji takes to this heart, as evidenced by him stopping the serial murderer in the \"Stabbed Wallet\" case from committing suicide.\nHis relationship with Shinichi/Conan from his end. In Heiji's first appearance, he traveled all the way to Tokyo to challenge Shinichi Kudo to a deduction battle so he could win and show he was the superior detective of the two. After Shinichi solves the case (which included correcting Heiji's wrong assumptions), the Tokyoite detective then gives a short speech to the Osakan that there's no such thing as the superior or inferior detective, only the truth; Heiji is left both speechless and amazed. Throughout his subsequent appearances (which involved deducing \"Conan's\" real identity), Heiji may have kept his competitiveness towards his fellow detective, but he now considers Shinichi/Conan to be his partner and best friend, willing to do anything to ensure his happiness and safety.\n",
    "Appearance": "Heiji is a handsome man with dark brown, spiky hair and dark brown skin which he claims is inherited from his 71-year-old paternal grandfather.[17] His eyes are blue in the manga (like every character). Initially, his eyes appeared dark green, but are now blue[18]. He speaks with a strong Kansai Ben accent, which is typical of the Osaka region. Since Heiji is so strongly accustomed to this accent, his lingual habit can be a disadvantage at times, especially when he has to impersonate someone who uses standard Japanese.[19][20] He has a scar behind the left ear from being hit during an Oyodo competition as said in episode 263.\nHe has also been shown to be popular with girls due to his good looks, position as kendo captain at his high school, and his fame as a high school detective. For example, in episode 263 when several girls tried to flirt with him but he had switched his gear with another team member to make a last minute call to Conan to visit his match. This was shown in Magic File 4: The Osaka Okonomiyaki Killer where several girls came to ask for an autograph and in OVA 9, he was referred to as a lady killer.\n",
    "Skills": "",
    "Keen Intellect": "Heiji's detective skills are the same as Shinichi's. Because of his skills, Heiji has acquired his nickname \"The Great Detective Of The West.\" Like Shinichi, he has a keen eye for details, and can spot any unusual aspects in a case that most people tend to ignore or not take into account and has extraordinarily broad and deep knowledge of many subjects and trivia that help him solve cases. He repeatedly demonstrates the ability to recall every detail of an investigation, and may have a photographic memory to manage such perfect recall so consistently. Heiji's fastidious attention to detail allows him to notice minor inconsistencies in crime scenes and suspect testimony. However, unlike Shinichi, Heiji seem to be more competitive and hot-blooded while solving a case, which sometimes leads him into making a wrong deduction i.e. the case in his first appearance. Like the other \"genius\" detectives, Heiji has shown himself to have an eidetic memory, capable of remembering complex letter and number sequences at only a glance, such as when he was able to solve a code in his head during the \"Heiji and Kazuha in Grave Danger\" arc, and even reproduce another message using the same code to text to Conan. When Heiji and Shinichi work together, they're each other's equal and will often arrive at the same conclusions. But when they compete with each other or their deductions differ, Shinichi usually wins. Recent cases have begun to subvert this, but usually only with subjects Heiji specializes in - e.g. kendo. He is also good if it comes to someone who has his own dialect, Kansai dialect.\n",
    "Athletic ability": "Heiji is the fifth position, or taisho, and captain of his high school Kendo team. Heiji may disable criminals using an improvised bokken similar to how Conan uses his soccer skills. Heiji is also very nimble, able to jump higher than a bookshelf, seamlessly scale the side of the staircase, and balance perfectly on a katana. This is shown in episode 263 of the anime, when Kotegawa tries to kill him.\n",
    "Others": "Heiji is also a capable motorcycle rider. He also speaks fluent English.[21] Heiji has shown to have the ability to deduce a woman's swimsuit without actually looking at it.[22] He is also shown to have a \"Kudou Radar\" where he correctly guessed Conan's involvement in the case without actually seeing Conan.[23]\n",
    "Appellations": "\n",
    "Plot overview": "",
    "Great Detective of the West (Manga: 92-96, Anime: 48-49)": "One day, as Conan (using his Voice-Changer Tie to imitate his old voice) calls Ran to tell her once again that he is all right and that he is still stuck with the 'special case', Ran hangs up on him as someone has just entered the detective agency. Coming home, Conan finds to his surprise that the 'customer' is a youth who keeps demanding to see Shinichi Kudo. He had read of Kogoro solving cases and jumps to the conclusion that he is getting help from Shinichi. When Ran mentions that Shinichi has just called, without asking about Ran's state, the youth deduces that Shinichi must actually be nearby, watching Ran from afar. He then introduces himself as high school detective Heiji Hattori and presents a gift, a bottle of paikaru, of which he gives Conan a swig. Just then, Kimie Tsujimura, the wife of a known diplomat, enters Kogoro's office to ask him to investigate the girlfriend of her son. In order to be inconspicuous, Kogoro takes Ran and Conan along, and Heiji, hoping to flush out Shinichi, tags along as well.

    "Holmes Freak Case (Manga: 117-121, Anime: 57-58)": "After this first case, it only takes one more run-in with Conan to get Heiji thinking about the similarities between Conan and Shinichi. It is on the \"Holmes Freak Murder Case\" that Heiji, despite professing a preference for Ellery Queen, exercises the Holmesian axiom: \"When you've eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\" In addition, after Conan had knocked him out to use him as his mouthpiece to present his evidence, Heiji receives a clout on the head from Kogoro Mouri, which wakes him up again, and from the corner of his eye he spies Conan standing behind him and using his Voice-Changing Bowtie to mimic his voice; he thus discovers Conan's secret, which forces Conan to explain his situation.\n",

When she realizes that she won't be able to kill herself she weeps piteously, causing Heiji to whisper to Conan, \"perhaps we should have let her die.\" Conan replies that \"a detective who corners a murderer with logic and then lets them commit suicide is no better than a murderer.\"\n",

It is revealed by Kazuha Toyama (in her first appearance) that Heiji has been talking about 'Kudo' so often that Kazuha thought 'Kudo' was his new Tokyo girlfriend. Heiji suggests that the reason he invited Conan to Osaka is because he has been worried about Conan's safety; he has had dreams of Conan being murdered. On a case together in Osaka, Heiji gives Conan his omamori, which ends up saving his life by deflecting a knife thrust. However, without it Heiji is injured while trying to prevent the murderer from committing suicide. In the ambulance, he reveals to Conan that he has taken to heart Conan's admonishment.\n",

Late that night, an unknown man takes the murder weapon and tries to place it in a bag, but is caught by Heiji and Conan who reveal that they placed the blame on the butler to lure out the true culprit.

Heiji tries to beat Conan to the truth and goes off on his own to investigate.

During a romantic scene, a man in the audience falls dead, seemingly by potassium cyanide, as revealed by a young man in the audience who appears to be Shinichi Kudo. This is quickly debunked, as Kazuha recognizes Heiji in disguise, and the real Shinichi has shown up anyway.

Heiji tells Misari Ito he will tell her the seven digits and they head to the bank. Heiji reveals that the numbers, if placed in a 3 by 3 diagram, will create a diagram of a dice with the 1's representing the dots on a dice.

Humorously, all the cases that appeared to be linked to a serial killer, were not connected at all. It was all done to lessen the suspicion on the culprit's true intention of murder. During their conversation, Heiji invited Kogoro and Conan to assist him in a new case that he wished to solve. They keep a close watch on the house whose occupant had asked for their assistance, even after the one who requested them declined the service.

A news reporter, who was present to cover the original case, accuses Shinichi of faking the memory loss and states that she knows the 'truth' about him. The next morning, the reporter is found stabbed, with no one but Shinichi in the house, and a knife with him, turning him into the one and only suspect.\nHeiji takes it upon himself to both prove Shinichi's innocence and hide him from the police, helped by Ran, Kogoro and Kazuha. He skilfully proves that the culprit had undergone cosmetic surgery, to impersonate Shinichi and commit a crime to destroy his reputation. The real Shinichi, too, turns up (after mistakenly ingesting Haibara's APTX 4869 antidote prototype) to justify his deductions about the year-old double deaths.\nAfter the antidote's effects start wearing off, Heiji tries to prevent Shinichi from turning into Conan in front of Ran, by taking him to the toilet and asking him to hide in his (Heiji's) travel bag, so that he can make up some story about the disappearance and get him home.\n",

    "Kazuha Toyama": "Like Shinichi's relationship with Ran, Heiji's relationship with Kazuha is a very close one: they know each other since their childhoods, and have stayed close through the years. Their relationship is identified as a romantic one by other characters and fans alike, even though they claim that they don't have that sort of relationship or feelings for each other. Heiji is clueless when it comes to love and in the majority of the manga and anime has not yet realized he has actual feelings for Kazuha, until recently. On the class trip where Ran and Shinichi almost share a kiss, Heiji is explicitly jealous, all the while thinking of Kazuha, even saying “[he’s] running out of places to confess.” While it’s unknown when he plans on confessing, it is clear that Heiji loves Kazuha. It has been shown that he becomes visibly jealous when he sees Kazuha with other guys, becoming distracted throughout the whole case. At one point, after a certain case, while looking at Kazuha, his thoughts read: 'Fool. You're too naive. I promise you, as long as you're with me, I'll never let anyone hurt you.'. Kazuha knows she has feelings for Heiji, as she shows this by being protective and chasing off other women that might have a interest in him In on of the mangas Kazuha attempts to confess her feelings after finding out that Shinichi had done so with Ran, but is unlucky because by telling him, Heiji ran off to tease Conan(Shinichi) for it. She one time even attempted to sacrifice herself to save Heiji during a case in which accidentally both fell off a cliff. When the branch that Heiji was holding and both of them were hanging on to was breaking, she stabbed his hand with an arrow of love to prevent him from falling and force him to let her fall; however, he still held on despite the wound. Also, they have a similar situation to Ran and Shinichi, being childhood friends that have romantic feelings for each other and have similar backgrounds. Heiji is a teenage detective and she is a police detective's daughter, like Ran is a detective's daughter and Shinichi is a teenage detective. They are even called the 'Ran and Shinichi of Osaka' by fans of the series, since they're so similar. Although they are constantly fighting, they both are very close friends. It is also shown in the seventh movie, Crossroad in the Ancient Capital, that Kazuha is Heiji's first love, though he didn't know it was her at the time. In the most recent case, Heiji confessed to Kazuha when she was taken away by some suspicious men, saying \"What are you doing to my Kazuha?!\". When Kazuha questioned him about it, he claimed that she was wrong and there was no evidence that proves his confession (although Shinichi recorded it). Nonetheless, it is shown in the file 912 that he has actually realized his feelings for her, as Ran questions him about the confession. He denies it to her, but thinks that he needed a more important place to confess, as Kudo confessed in front of the Big Ben.\n",
    "Shinichi Kudo/Conan Edogawa": "His sharp intellect helped Heiji quickly figure out Conan's real identity as Shinichi. Heiji acts rather brotherly towards Shinichi, even going so far as to pretend to be him on various occasions so that no one figures out that Shinichi and Conan are the same person. Of course, this might also be to make up for all the times Heiji calls him Kudo, which has nearly given Shinichi away multiple times. Heiji is concerned for Shinichi when he gets into trouble and life-or-death situations. They are as close as real brothers, both being detectives who have romantic feelings for their childhood friends. When they're caught solving a case together, it's not unusual for their minds to move in sync; because of this and several other factors, they maintain a sort of friendly rivalry with each other. However, they are both all business when a case gets serious. Heiji has, on several occasions, declared himself to be Shinichi's best friend.[25] He also becomes extremely determined to one-up Shinichi's London confession to Ran by creating an even better setting to one day confess his love to his childhood friend, Kazuha. He was finally able to confess in a magical sunset spot by accident, and Conan was even there to witness this!\nEven with his teasing, Heiji genuinely wants Shinichi (Conan) and Ran to become a couple. During the Desperate Revival Arc he suggested that Shinichi tell Ran the truth about the Black Organization to ease both of their suffering, but has since accepted that Shinichi wants to protect Ran above all and keep her away from the Black Organization.\n",
    "Ran Mouri": "Heiji and Ran are very good friends, bonding after Heiji's many trips to Tokyo because he \"misses Conan\". Ran respects Heiji as a very skilled detective who reminds her of Shinichi, but whenever Heiji and Kazuha run into an argument, Ran seems to take Kazuha's side.\nSince Heiji knows that Ran is Shinichi's Girlfriend, he tends to tease Shinichi about her quite often and will give him advice on his romantic relationship with her. He is also sometimes protective of her for the sake of Shinichi, such as when Soshi Okita flirted with Ran and he told him to back off since she is \"his friend's girl\" referring to Shinichi.[26] Since it's practically identical with his relationship with Kazuha (Even though they aren't on the same level as Shinichi & Ran's romantic relationship).\nHeiji almost views Ran as a sister, as he will tease her from time to time and he'll help explain things to her during cases along with Kazuha.\n",
    "Heizo Hattori": "Heiji wants to become a detective, and his father is very supportive of this, helping him solve tough cases. However, his father prefers a \"tough love\" approach, though mostly for the sole purpose of using Heiji to lure out a suspect.[27]\n",
    "Shizuka Hattori": "Shizuka is Heiji's mother and he sometimes calls her an \"old lady\".\n",
    "Kogoro Mouri": "Kogoro respects him a little as a detective, but due to Heiji being the better detective, he seems to get annoyed whenever Heiji is with him while solving cases.\n",
    "Goro Otaki": "Otaki and Heiji are very good friends.\n",
    "Juzo Megure": "Usually Megure gets a little annoyed whenever Heiji runs into a case he is handling. He often tells Kogoro to not to lose to an outsider like Heiji. Despite this, Megure respects Heiji as a very skilled detective, and he has even declared Heiji as a better detective than Shinichi.\n",
    "Momiji Ooka": "Momiji is close to her \"future husband\" Heiji. According to the 21st movie (which has yet to be contradicted by the manga / anime), they met as children and played karuta together. Heiji made a \"pinky promise\" with her about playing more later, which Momiji mistook as a marriage proposal. Unbeknownst to Heiji, Momiji held on the promise for several years, firmly believing that they are destined to be together.\nHowever, despite Momiji's feelings for Heiji, he does not reciprocate them most because of his feelings for Kazuha.\n",
