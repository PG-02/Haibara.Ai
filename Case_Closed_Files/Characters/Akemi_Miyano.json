    "Background": "Akemi Miyano, the oldest child of Elena Miyano and Atsushi Miyano, was born into the Black Organization approximately some 25 years before the current timeline.[1] Unlike her younger sister Shiho Miyano, Akemi was never considered a high ranking member of the Organization and managed to live a mostly normal life, traveling about freely and going to school and college like normal, despite being watched over by the organization. Both of her parents later died an accident while she was young, orphaning Akemi and Shiho. Although her sister became a highly ranked codenamed scientist, Akemi remained in close contact with Shiho and served as her lifeline to normalcy. She only involved herself into the organization to try get Shiho out of it.\nAt some point 13 years ago she attended Teitan Elementary School and graduated from it. She was in Class 6-A.[2]\nSome five years before the current timeline, Akemi met undercover FBI agent Shuichi Akai who was using the alias Dai Moroboshi. He planned to date Akemi in order to get close to Shiho Miyano so he could gain standing within the Black Organization as part of his mission. Although Shuichi initially was just using her, they wound up really falling in love. Akemi discovered Shuichi was an FBI agent and guessed his plan, but kept this knowledge secret even from him. Three years later, Shuichi's true allegiance was uncovered and he was ejected from the Organization. Akemi then revealed that she knew his secret, and that she wished to leave the Organization and date him seriously.\nThis did not happen because Akemi was unwilling to leave without her sister, and the Black Organization would not allow Shiho to go because her work on the APTX 4869 project was extremely valuable. Although Shuichi stopped contacting Akemi for her safety, the Organization was planning to get rid of her anyway because her connection to Shuichi was considered a serious risk. The Organization could not simply eliminate her though because it would jeopardize Shiho's loyalty. The Black Organization finally put their plan to kill Akemi into motion two years later just after Shinichi had shrunk into Conan Edogawa.\n",
    "Personality": "Akemi had a nurturing, kind, friendly, cheerful and outgoing personality, with a good sense of humor. Playful as a child, she enjoyed playing games and creating codes for other people, but never to hurt them. For example, she hid the work tools of her father's friends and happily watched as they panicked; however, she only wanted them to work less hard. Even though she knew of her elementary classmates’ mischievings, in the class memory capsule, she did not rat them out but simply wished everyone well. She was popular among classmates for her sweet nature. She appeared likable and well-adjusted considering that she had to change schools many times.\nAs an adult, she remained loving despite being in the Black Organization. She likely had to violate her moral code to complete criminal missions for them. However, she was strong-willed enough to arrange an escape deal for her and her sister. Although they rarely saw each other, she and her sister Shiho were very close and confided in each other. However, Shuichi says Akemi was always crying in the dark while pretending to be strong, suggesting that she had painful memories she did not want to burden other people with. Her selfless, nurturing, and slightly vulnerable personality reminds Shiho (as Haibara Ai) as well as Akai Shuichi of Ran Mouri.\nAkemi was clever and calculating, given that she could plan a 1-billion-yen robbery. Her convincing disguise and acting eluded even Conan.\n",
    "Appearance": "Akemi is often noted to be very similar to Ran. Both Haibara and Shuichi get the feeling that they are alike. She is a pretty Japanese girl with long black hair and a medium height.\n",
    "Plot overview": "",
    "¥1,000,000,000 Robbery Case (Manga: 013-016, Anime: 13/128)": "The Organization's plan to silence Akemi was to pretend to make a deal with her; in exchange for a successful one billion yen bank robbery, Gin told Akemi she and Shiho could go free. The Organization thought Akemi would surely fail and thus they would have an acceptable reason to kill her. Akemi hired two partners to help her. Kenzo Hirota, a Tokyoite with no family, would be the get-away driver, because he used to work as a taxi driver. An unnamed giant man would serve as muscle. The day before the mission, she send a text to Akai, explaining the situation and asked if he would want to go out with her for real, should she manage to get out of the organization.\nAkemi and her two partners successfully pull off the robbery, killing a guard in the process. Unfortunately, Kenzo Hirota then backstabs Akemi and the giant by running away with the billion yen. In order to track him down, Akemi and her partner approach different detectives pretending to be Kenzo's relatives. Akemi creates the alias Hirota Masami, borrowing from a professor friend's name, and changing her hairstyle so she appears to be a high school girl from Yamagata looking for her missing \"father\".[3] Akemi approaches the then-not-well-known Detective Kogoro at his office and convinces him to help her. Kogoro begins to search for the man's via his contacts.\nSometime while Kogoro is searching for Kenzo, Akemi meets with Shiho at a restaurant and describes Conan to her. Akemi tells Shiho that Conan lives in the Mouri Detective Agency near the Kudo house that Shiho had visited earlier (as part of a search to ensure Shinichi was really killed by APTX 4869) and that he has the composure of an adult. Shiho then asks Akemi to tell her about the dangerous mission that Akemi had just performed, but Akemi tells Shiho she is fine and that she should stop working on that drug and try to get a boyfriend instead.\nWith Conan and Ran's help, Kogoro finds Kenzo and \"Hirota Masami\" pretends to be overjoyed at their \"reunion\". Later that night, Akemi and the giant man confront Kenzo to take back the money. A fight breaks out between the two men, resulting in the giant strangling Kenzo to death against Akemi's wishes. Akemi and the giant hang Kenzo's corpse from a rope to make it appear like a suicide, grab the cash, and leave for a hotel. Akemi slips some pills given to her by Gin into the giant's drink so she could take the money, unaware that they were laced with cyanide and would kill him instantly. With both of her partners dead, she hides the suitcases of money at the hotel's front desk and takes a taxi to meet Gin and Vodka at the shipping yard, with Conan following closely behind.[4]\nWhen she arrives at the meeting place, she tells Gin that she will only tell him where the money is after he frees her sister, but Gin goes back on his word, saying her sister is far too valuable to let go of. He gives her one last chance to cooperate, but she refuses and he shoots her. Conan arrives at the scene with her bleeding out. Akemi is one of the few characters in the show that knows Conan is Shinichi Kudo, as he admits it to her while she is dying in front of him, while she tells him about the dangers of the Black Organization and tells him where the money is.[5] Akemi's death is ruled a suicide, as Gin's fingerprints were not found on the gun that killed her,[5] but her fingerprints were.[4]\n",
    "Murdered Professor Case (Manga: 179-181, Anime: 129)": "Haibara, the shrunken Shiho Miyano, remembers her meetings with Akemi leading up to her death by Gin. She breaks down in front of Conan asking why he could not save Akemi.\n",
    "Bathroom Murder Case (Manga: 423-425, Anime: 340-341)": "20 years prior to the current timeline, Atsushi Miyano and Elena Miyano visit Atsushi's father's house whom he had left to a friend. They brought with them a 4-5 year old Akemi. The friend had turned the house into a Design company office. The Miyano's had come there and acted like they were hiding from something/someone. Akemi hid the tools of the workers causing her to unknowingly prevent a murder from occurring. Closer to the present day, around one week prior to her death, Akemi returned and planted tapes created by Elena for Shiho, in the same spot that she had hid the tools years before. She told one of the workers that she would be back with-in the week and bring her sister to meet them.\n",

    "Non-canon plot overview": "In the anime, she works at a bank under the name Masami Hirota and pulls an inside job.

    "Appellations": "\n",
    "Relationships analysis": "",
    "Shuichi Akai": "Shuichi Akai and Akemi Miyano were lovers while he was infiltrating the Black Organization. Shuichi's original mission was to date Akemi Miyano in order to meet Shiho Miyano. Shuichi used Shiho's influence to gain rank in the Organization, intending to become trusted enough to meet with high level agents so the FBI could capture one for questioning. As James Black later recalls, although Shuichi's relationship with Akemi was merely a stepping stone, Shuichi actually fell in love with Akemi, and considered her his real girlfriend. Because of this he broke up with the woman (and felow agent) he dated until then, Jodie Starling; he cared deeply for Jodie, but since he had fallen for Akemi he didn't want to keep two parallel relationships.\nHow Akemi and Shuichi met in the manga is unknown, but in the anime, Shuichi Akai originally met Akemi by an intentional accident. She accidentally hit him with her car when he deliberately walked into the street in front of her in order to be hit by her.[10] Akemi helped take him to the hospital, watching over him until he was better. When he woke up, he felt no anger over what she did, and even asked for her name, to which a very flustered Akemi replied, while he told her his fake name: Dai Moroboshi. After this they began dating.\nSometime later, Akemi develops the suspicion that Shuichi really wasn't who he claimed to be. Later, due to a massive error by Andre Camel, Shuichi is discovered by the rest of the Organization to be an FBI agent, leading to his expulsion. Shuichi confirms that he is an FBI agent to her. To Shuichi's surprise, Akemi doesn’t seem surprised by this, prompting Shuichi to ask why she never mentioned her suspicions about being used by him. Akemi subtly hints that it’s because she loves him. Initially, the Organization couldn’t take action against Akemi due to their need to secure her sister’s loyalty. However, two years later, they deemed the risk of her contact with Shuichi too great. They orchestrated a plan to eliminate her by staging a bank heist, knowing she would fail. Shortly before the heist, Akemi sent Shuichi a long text, asking if he would want to be her real boyfriend once she was finally free from the Organization[11]. After the heist, Akemi is killed by Gin, and it is unknown how Shuichi responded if at all. Shuichi treasures her final text message, and keeps it in his phone many months after Akemi's death.\nAkemi never learned before her death that Shuichi was actually her cousin.[12]\n",
    "Ai Haibara": "Despite the fact that they couldn't see each other often, Akemi and her sister Shiho were very close to each other. Akemi had constantly tried to encourage the studious and workaholic Shiho to relax and find herself a boyfriend.\nAkemi's death scarred her sister deeply. Much of Akemi's personality Shiho finds personified in Ran Mouri - perhaps this is the main reason why Shiho was first reluctant to accept her (due to the still-fresh pain of her loss), but eventually came to consider her as a surrogate sister.\n",
    "Rei Furuya": "Akemi seems to have known Rei Furuya, and described him and his relationship with Shuichi to Shiho.This is not revealed yet. In the flashback during The Unsolved Cocktail Case, it shows that Akemi and Rei met and knew each other from when they were children. They might be close. Akemi cared about Rei. However, according to Aoyama Gosho, Akemi did not remember Rei when she is a adult. This implies that when meeting each other in the black organization, Akemi did not realize that Bourbon was Rei. This protected the true person of Rei.\n",
    "Akai Family": "In File 1049, the flashback conversations between Vermouth and Mary confirmed that Mary and Elena are sisters. So that Akemi is blood relatives with Akai family.\n",
    "Speculation": "",
    "Hidden P.S.": "In the text message that Akemi Miyano sent to Shuichi Akai before she commits the bank robbery, aside from the main content, there is also a \"P.S.\" shown below it, at the bottom left corner of his cell phone's screen. However, what Akemi wrote under that part (the things she wanted to say in the P.S.) has never been revealed to the readers (watchers).\nThere is a common speculation among the fans that Akemi has asked Shuichi Akai to protect the safety of her sister, Shiho Miyano, in case the robbery she planned ends up in failure, or that the Black Organization decides to betray their promise, which is to let her and her sister leave if she succeeds. It is important to note that in the Manga File 810, Shuichi, while disguising as Subaru Okiya, has mentioned in his mind about the promise he made with a certain \"her\", because of which he refuses to make Ai Haibara go with him by force.[13] This woman whom Shuichi was referring to might have been his late girlfriend Akemi, and his promise with her might be relevant to the hidden content of the mysterious P.S.\n",
    "Different looks": "",
    "Trivia": "- Akemi's voice actress, Sakiko Tamagawa, is in real-life married to Shuichi Akai's voice actor, Shuichi Ikeda.\n- She is the first one Shinichi Kudo revealed himself to besides Professor Agasa, in the second manga volume.\n- In Just Like a 17 Years Old Crime Scene Haibara mentioned that Akemi had a Put On Mascara mirror that originally belonged to Elena.\n- In Episode 312, it’s revealed by Haibara that her parent bought Akemi festival dolls that look like the Hinamatsu Dolls at the apartment the Detective Boys were in, but when their parents died, Akemi put them away as they brought painful memories of Haibara and Akemi deceased parents.\n- She often had to transfer schools under the Black Organization's orders.[14]\n- Akemi was in the library committee and as well being popular in Teitan Elementary school.\n"
