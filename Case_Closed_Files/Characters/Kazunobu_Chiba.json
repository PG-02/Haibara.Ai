    "Background": "Initially, he was introduced with a minor cameo in the anime version of The Final Screening Murder Case. Like several other Anime Original characters, he was later introduced in the manga and has taken on a larger role. In many of his early appearances he is depicted as rather average build, but later depicted as overweight. Chiba currently works in the Second violent crimes investigative division, section 3.[4] His duties usually consist of questioning non-suspect characters outside of the crime scene, and running evidence back to the lab as well as returning with the results. A majority of his appearances happen just over half way through a case where he returns to the crime scene with a vital clue needed to solve the case. He has a strong moral compass that usually puts the law above everything. If any one were to break the law they must be punished, even himself.\nChiba has an older brother who worked as an employee at a video rental store. Because of his job, the brother had to open the heads of VHS tapes to check if they had been rewound properly. Chiba has picked up knowledge of VHS tapes as well as this habit of opening their heads to check them.\nChiba attended Teitan Elementary School, in the 20th graduating class, 2 classes below Sumiko Kobayashi. While still in elementary school he was a part of the broadcasting committee and was put in charge of making a mini-audio drama, which was successful. As a result, he tried to put together a short Tokusatsu (live action special effects) drama based on the Kamen Yaiba show he watched. With the help of fellow classmate Naeko Miike rallying the other members, he was able to complete it. He began to suspect that she may like him so he wrote her a love letter, which she responded to by saying that there was a hidden message left in the video room with her answer. Her family then moved away and Chiba was unable to find her answer.\nIn the present day, he returned to the school and with the help of the Detective Boys found her response. It was something that only Chiba would have been likely to find because since childhood, he has a tendency to sweat often. Recently Naeko, who joined the police force because of Chiba, has transferred to Tokyo as a patrol woman who works with Yumi Miyamoto. However, Chiba doesn't seem to recognize her despite having several chances to do so. After realizing that Chiba doesn't recognize her, Naeko has been trying to keep it a secret until he realizes it for himself.[5]\n",
    "Personality": "Chiba can be serious, but he is shown to be a mostly light-hearted officer. He loves to eat and is sometimes shown stuffing his face, usually with burgers and sodas, but usually this is merely done for comic effect. Chiba can be very supportive, and is a big help, especially for using his size to catch criminals. He, as well as Yumi Miyamoto, is very supportive for Takagi's relationship and feelings for Sato, and is one of the few officers in the Tokyo district to not get involved in Shiratori's schemes to get the couple to break up.\nA very notable trait of Chiba praised by his colleagues in Law Enforcement is that he would always follow and uphold the law no matter what the circumstances are, especially when it is he who breaks it. This is one of the main reasons why Naeko liked him in the first place; it was because he scolded her over a traffic violation, saying that doing the wrong thing will develop into a habit that's hard to get rid of. This event also inspired Naeko to join the Police Force as a traffic cop.\nHe has been a huge fan of tokusatsu shows like Kamen Yaiba and Gomera for a long time, and was a member of the broadcasting committee at his elementary school. For a project, he and the other club members made a tokusatsu film called Kamen Baiya. Since then his enjoyment tokusatsu has grown and his apartment seems to be covered in figurines based on the characters.\nChiba seems to be very knowledgeable about Betamax tapes He has a habit of checking VHS tapes to see if they were rewound. He believes he picked this habit up from his older brother.[5]\n",

When Naeko was to move away, Chiba wrote down his feelings in a love letter.

His original physical appearance was modeled after him as well.\nSDB70+ : Q73: Have you established detective Chiba’s first name? \nA: His voice actor’s is Isshin… It might just become Isshin. But everyone with “一” (ichi) in their name is a cool guy… I don’t know what to do. (laughs)\nHe effectively removed the \"一\" (ichi) in Isshin Chiba (千葉 一伸 ?) and changed it to a \"和\" which can be read as \"Kazu\" for the original name Kazunobu Chiba (千葉 和伸 ?).\n",
