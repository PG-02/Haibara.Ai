    "Background": "Tomoaki Araide is the son of Kogoro Mouri's physician, Yoshiteru Araide, and also on occasion the basketball coach and school medic at Teitan High, the school Shinichi Kudo, Ran Mouri and Sonoko Suzuki attended. Tomoaki had studied at the University of Tokyo; during this time, he had treated a young woman named Hikaru Yasumoto, who was later hired into the Araide household as a maid.\nWhen Yoshiteru Araide invited Kogoro Mouri, his daughter Ran and Conan Edogawa to dinner in his house, Conan noticed that Ran was paying a lot of unusual attention on Araide. The sojourn, however, quickly turned into a murder case as Yoshiteru Araide was found electrocuted in his bathtub. The murderer turned out to be Yoko Araide, Araide's wife and Tomoaki's stepmother, who had avenged the suicide of her dear friend Chiaki (Tomoaki's mother) over her husband's extramarital affairs four years previously. And as it turned out, Ran's attention on Tomoaki was in fact directed at the sweater he was wearing, of which she subsequently made two copies both for her father and Shinichi, who came to wear it still being Conan.[1]\n",
    "Vermouth as Araide": "Although he had been offered a position at a clinic in Aomori, Tomoaki stayed on and maintained his late father's practise. However, it was later learned that his identity had been usurped by Vermouth, as a disguise to track down Ai Haibara. Jodie Starling of the FBI discovered this, which resulted in Araide and his family being rescued just as Vermouth attempted to kill them in order to cover her tracks, and eventually led to Vermouth ending her role as Araide.[2]\nAraide returned to Japan after Vermouth had been exposed, and has continued to practice in the Beika area ever since. He has also come to know about Conan's involvement with the FBI from Jodie Starling, but remains unaware of his true role in the chain of events.[3]\n",
    "Personality": "Araide is a very kind character and doctor, always lending a hand whenever he is needed. He tends to believe in the good of man and thus can be a bit too trusting at times.[4]\n",

    "Plot overview": "",
    "The Unseen Angle of the Darkness (Manga: 234-237, Anime: 170-171)": "Kogoro Mouri visits Araide clinic with Ran and Conan so that his doctor Yoshiteru can give him the results of his health checkup. Ran goes to the bathroom during their visit and meets Tomoaki Araide on the way. Tomoaki Araide’s father is then killed in his bathtub via electrocution. Detective Takagi, Inspector Megure, and other nameless policemen investigate the murder.\nConan investigates and discovers Yoko Araide, Yoshiteru Araide's second wife was the murderer. She caused a blackout to occur while she was supposedly on the phone, and during the ensuing darkness, snuck to the bathtub and put the shaver in the bathtub. She then snuck back and asked the housemaid Hikaru Yasumoto to flip the circuit breaker, causing Yoshiteru Araide to be electrocuted.\nThe motive was that Araide's mother, Chiaki, died four years ago from driving under alcohol's influence, although she supposedly hated alcohol. She left a message to Yoko Araide to “Please take care of Tomoaki. Don’t let him follow his dad.” A journal Yoko found later indicates that Yoshiteru Araide was a flirtatious guy who drove Chiaki to drink. Meanwhile, Araide becomes very upset that his family is suspected by the police and that a trap was laid (by Conan) to catch the murderer. Araide rushes to the bathroom and overhears “Mouri’s” offer to conceal some of the details of the crime to protect the maid Hikaru’s conscience. This offer proves crucial as Vermouth does not know this detail because the records of investigation were altered to protect the maid’s conscience.\n",
    "Bus Jack (Manga: 287-289, Anime: 230-231)": "Vermouth disguised as Araide; same below and all the way to episode 345.\n",
    "Four Porsches (Manga: 420-422, Anime 338-339)": "",
    "Head to Head with the Black Organization (Manga: 429-434, Anime: 345)": "The fact that Vermouth has been disguising as Araide for some time is revealed by Jodie Starling. The real Araide was in the U.S. with his family members during this time, under the protection of the FBI.\n",
    "Teitan High School's Ghost Story (Manga: 457-459, Anime: 361-362)": "Since the FBI deems it safe for Araide (and his family members) to return to Japan, Araide comes back to Teitan High School and carries on Vermouth's work. Since he does not really know who Vermouth is, and learns that his impersonator seems to have been kind and helpful to students and staff alike, he asks Jodie whether Vermouth is really a bad person. Upon hearing this, Jodie becomes exceedingly grumpy, yells \"how can a person who smiles while killing someone be a good person?\" and hangs up, thinking at Vermouth has the terrifying ability of mimicking others' personality as well.\nIn these two episodes (or chapters) Araide also helps Sonoko, Ran and Conan with investigating the school ghost mystery. Conan solves the case and tranquillizes Sonoko in order to deduce, but this is interrupted by Araide, who attempts to examine Sonoko. Conan quickly stops Araide by using Sonoko's hand to slap his and by claiming (in Sonoko's voice) that it is her \"show time\".\nAfter the case is solved, Araide tells Masao Monobe (a student of Teitan High School) that he, as the school's physician, was with Hideaki Hosaka (a fellow student of Monobe) shortly before Hosaka's death. Araide claims that although Hosaka was fatally injured at that time, he was still joking about the accident (which had been caused by Monobe). Araide later admits that the joking part is a white lie aiming to stop Monobe from keeping feeling guilty for a fellow student's death.\n",
    "The Secret Path to School (Manga: 507, Anime: 428)": "A missing girl caught in a hit and run leads the detective boys to Araide’s hospital. Araide then starts raising two stray kittens while seeking new owners for them.\n",
    "Non-canon plot overview": "",
    "The Stranger from Ten Years Later (OVA: 9)": "Tomoaki Araide appears to have developed feelings for Ran and proposes to her ten years in the future. Ran, however, rejects him, saying she's willing to wait another ten years for Shinichi's return. However, since this story was all part of a fever hallucination Conan was suffering at that time, it can be dismissed as non-relevant. Later, after his fever fell, Conan eats supper with his family and Araide, who has come to heal him and take care of him and at the glance of Ran talking to him, Conan remembers his dream and stares angrily at him.\n",
    "Stork Mystery Tour (Anime: 554-555)": "Tomoaki appears in a flashback in which Conan explains why he sprained his ankle. It was in fact because he was in a staircase in the street with the Detective Boys and saw Araide with Ran and thought about the idea of the two dating together and, as his attention was somewhere else, he slipped and fell off the staircase spraining his ankle.\n",
    "Relationships analysis": "",
    "Ran Mouri": "Araide and Ran Mouri became friends while Araide was acting as a temporary basketball coach in place of a teacher who broke his leg. During \"The Blind Spot in the Darkness\", Conan wrongly came to the conclusion that Ran was attracted to Araide. In truth, she wanted to borrow his sweater in order to knit a similarly patterned one for Shinichi. Some anime-original features play with the idea that Araide is interested in Ran, most notably in the OVA story The Stranger from Ten Years Later where he proposed to her, but this was only a dream of Conan's and can be ignored.\n",
    "Name origin": "Araide's given name 智明 is an anagram of Kogoro Akechi's surname 明智.\n",
