    "Background": "Makoto attended Haido High School, where he was a prominent member, and eventually the captain, of his karate team and became known as \"The Prince of Kicks\". He noticed Sonoko cheering on her friend Ran with great vigour during a martial arts tournament, and became interested in her.[3]\nSome time later, he worked in his family's inn as a waiter, where he encountered Sonoko again, this time in company of Ran and Conan.[3] Soon, however, Sonoko was stalked by a crazed serial killer who suspected her of having taken a picture of him at his latest murder (which she hadn't) and therefore wanted to both silence her as a potential witness and kill her because he hated brunette girls in general. Makoto saved her just in the nick of time, earning her affection, but his constant participation in martial arts competitions and a studying period overseas prevented them from seeing each other often enough.[3] Sonoko always does her best to maintain contact with him, though, including sending him little trinkets and gifts that she makes herself, and Makoto has stayed loyal to her. He usually gets caught up in one of Sonoko's silly romantic schemes. His fighting skills have proven to be incredibly handy for Conan, having saved Conan, Sonoko, and Ran from being in dangerous peril many times.\n",
    "Personality": "As a master martial artist, Makoto is usually cool, calm and collected, especially in crisis situations, and also a keen observer. At times, he can also adopt a very intimidating aura, making him appear very fearsome. In the TV Original episode \"The Mystery of the Vanished Black Belt\", it is explained that he adopted these personality facets following an encounter with the renowned martial artist and teacher Tatsuhito Takami in his youth.\nThe only thing which does throw Makoto off is his affection for Sonoko, for whom he will go to great lengths, even forsake an important tournament just to meet her. However, Makoto's bashfulness around her, his dedication to his fighting skills and some competitive impulse keep him jumping from one obligation to the other, so their relationship is rendered a bit difficult. But at one point, Sonoko introduces Makoto to her parents, and they eventually approve of him.\nMakoto's upbringing must have been rather conservative, since he doesn't quite approve (or at least expresses puzzlement about) Sonoko wearing modern, revealing clothes and therefore worries about her catching a cold whenever he sees her like this. Makoto always wears a band-aid above his left brow as a stereotypical mark for his fighting competitiveness. In The Fist of Blue Sapphire, the band-aid is shown to bear a photo from one of his dates with Sonoko on the inside, making it his personal talisman.\nHe is also a little careless like in his first appearance which made him a suspect, in episode 744-745 he sleep soundly in a car and didn't notice something happen which made yamamura to think him as a suspect and in file 1022 when he was practicing for film a man come and man said don't mind him, but when he wasn't paying attention the man was murdered and he became main suspect for case but the case was solved and he stopped culprit from committing suicide.\nDespite this, he is also well-mannered and serious like when Sonoko introduce him to her parents he was polite and was ready to help Suzuki family to protect the jewel that Kaitou kid want to steal and helping a woman which seems to be a hostage and stopping culprit from committing suicide.\n",
    "Appearance": "Makoto is a tall and well-built man of tan complexion. He has short black-hair with comparatively longer bangs and large eyebrows. He is noted to be very handsome. When not competing, he is often seen wearing wide glasses. He is constantly seen with a band-aid across the outer corned of his left eyebrow, which conceals a scar.\n",
    "Abilities and skills": "",
    "Martial arts": "Makoto is depicted as one of the most powerful martial artists in the series. In reference to his incredible ability, he is nicknamed the \"Prince of Kicks\". He has acquired championships in some international Karate tournaments.[4][5] Makoto also had a 400 win streak from matches around the world that was broken only when he skipped a tournament to be introduced to Sonoko's parents and lost by default.[6]\nMakoto's extraordinary might has repeatedly been seen against criminals carrying weapons and firearms.[7][8] As a show of his ability, Makoto was surrounded by 11 men armed with BB pistols. Despite wearing a gasmask that limited his field of view, he caught all the BBs they fired and knocked out all 11 men.[9] In another case, his unarmed combat skills send a huge group of gangsters armed with swords to the ground with no injuries suffered on his person, despite the latters' vastly superior numeric strength.[8] Even his kick alone can break the enemy's sword into two.[10] The people who have suffered from his attacks are usually depicted with severe injuries, such as bleeding or losing some teeth. Many often pass out or become unable to move.[10]\n",
    "Physical Prowess": "Makoto is shown to be able to throw a bowling ball all the way to the end of its lane (and smashing a hole into its headboard) when he tries to play bowling with Sonoko.[11] He has also been known to bring down a building pillar by repeatedly kicking and punching it,[12] and lift the tail of a van running at full speed to stop it from ramming a wall.[13] Makoto is fast and agile, showing remarkable flips and leaping might and likewise able to move about seamlessly with free-running skills. His observational skills and quick reaction time enable him to dodge a bullet[7] and block sword slashes.[8] Makoto seems completely immune to pain, dismissing a knife sticking in his arm as nothing too significant.[3]\nHe shown to know tennis in Conan in a Locked Room case. Makoto was able to dodge a bullet from a rifle which speed was 1000 meters per second. Makoto take a knife strike to hand, got injury with fighting with a drunk man and smash a pillar which he got bruise from it but didn't feel anything.\n",
    "Keen mind": "Makoto is shown to have an astute mind due to his extensive training, being able to identify Kaitou Kid disguised as Sonoko because of a difference in finger lengths. This is possible because he can take full dimensions of a person he meets in moments. It is a habit of analyzing his opponents physical features with a glance. In The Fist of Blue Sapphire, Kaito Kid and Conan had to distance themselves from Makoto throughout their trip in Singapore due to the two disguising in other identities through the trip and knowing Matoko would spot them out if he “pays attention towards them for too long”. He is also shown to be a quick study, able to memories a fight scene's choreography for a movie shortly after being given the part.\n",

    "Sonoko Suzuki": "Sonoko originally met Makoto Kyogoku while vacationing, where he was a waiter at a restaurant and worked at his family's inn in his spare time. At first, neither she, Conan, nor Ran recognized him, because he wore glasses to hide his features. After he later protects her from getting killed by a crazed serial killer, Sonoko and Makoto entertain a long distance relationship while Makoto goes to study abroad, which is additionally hampered by the fact that he tends to be a little bashful around her.[3]\nMakoto often saves Sonoko from dangerous peril, like in a snow lodge,[7] and in a forest.[8] Sonoko loves to use some kind of concocted scheme to get Makoto to come to her, usually in some romantic way, to create a romantic and dreamy experience for her.[8] This, however, doesn't always end in success, but he sometimes does stumble through her little schemes.[7][8] He often warns her of the way she is dressed, because he believes that guys will try to come after her because of it.[3][7]\nSonoko often wants to show Makoto that her feelings for him are stronger than he thinks, planning simple ideas to make him feel special. However, these often go in awry, as she either cannot make what she had planned to make, like when she promised to make him a home-made sweater, but had to resort to buying one in a mall,[20] or Makoto has no idea what she gave him is, like when he believed that the pottery she sent him was supposed to be for flowers.[21] Sonoko keeps a photo of Makoto in her bag, and uses it as a good luck charm for when she takes exams.[22] She has also made him a chocolate, trying to make him feel jealous by not saying who it was for, thus forcing him to visit her in a snow lodge to ask her what was going on.[7] When he finds out that indeed, she made him the chocolate, he gets very embarrassed himself.[7]\nAlthough long distance relationships can be hard to be in, and despite her constant flirting with any other attractive boy she stumbles upon, Sonoko has generally stayed faithful to Makoto, other than dreaming of meeting up with the Kaitou Kid, though this is mostly to see him up close more than anything else. Makoto also stays faithful to Sonoko.\n",
