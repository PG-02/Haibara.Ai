But the brothers did keep in touch with each other and both later became police officers. He was an undercover member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department Public Security Bureau inside the Black Organization. Not much has been revealed about his past and his time inside the organization, although he was acquainted with Rei Furuya (another undercover agent from the same organization) and Shuichi Akai (an undercover FBI agent using the alias Dai Moroboshi). Hiromitsu committed suicide before his real name and affiliation were revealed to the other Black Organization members.\nIn Wild Police Story, it is revealed that his parents were actually murdered by a man.

After he met Rei, he was able to overcome it in a way. Despite this trauma, he had a strong sense of justice, as when the murderer of his parents tried to commit suicide, he saved him.

In the Epilogue Shuichi mentions that Bourbon's grudge may be more deeply rooted than he thought. He has a brief flashback to himself and Bourbon covered in blood. During Bourbon and Vermouth's conversation, she mentions a male infiltrator from the Public Security Bureau (PSB) who had been killed before they could figure out his name. Bourbon tells her that his code name was \"Scotch\".\n",
    "Girls Band (Manga: 937-938, Anime: 836-837)": "Masumi has a flashback to four years ago where she saw her brother Shuichi on a train platform with another man. At that time, Masumi thought that Shuichi was supposed to be in America so she approached them. Shuichi told her to go away but she made the excuse that she did not have the money to get home. While Shuichi went to go buy her a ticket, the other man pulled a guitar out of the case on his back and taught her some notes. Before Shuichi returned, a third man that looks like Rei Furuya came over and called the other man \"Scotch\". Masumi believed this to be a nickname rather than an indication of his race because the man looked very Japanese.\nMasumi reveals to Conan, Ran, Sonoko, and Rei that her older brother Shuichi Akai is an FBI agent. Sonoko then enquirers if her brother's friend might be an FBI agent as well but Masumi denies this possibility by saying that he must have been a friend that Shuichi was meeting with while on vacation. Rei thinks to himself that Scotch was a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department Public Security Bureau and that Shuichi was the one responsible for his death.\n",
    "Bourbon's Mission (Manga: 954-957, Anime: 866-867)": "While driving around with Vermouth, Amuro thinks of the death of Hiromitsu. Then, Amuro was running up the external staircases of a building while thinking of Scotch's words \"I'm sorry Furuya, my PSB identity has been seen through by those people...it seems like the only route of retreat left is to the other world...goodbye Rei(Zero)\". At the top of the building Amuro found Akai standing over Scotch's corpse holding a smoking gun and saying \"Traitors...should be punished accordingly...right?\". Amuro wakes up to Vermouth telling them they need to pry information out of a target and then destroy them in one swoop.\nLater Conan, Subaru, Ran, and Sonoko run into Amuro and \"Azusa\", who Conan thinks is Vermouth, while trying to meet up with a musician who has some connection to a Rum case from 17 years ago. Rei speaks directly to Subaru, who he doesn't realize is Shuichi in disguise due to Scarlet Showdown. Conan reacts to them casually chatting and tells Subaru that they need to leave, but he doesn't want to. The group finds that the musician is already dead. At the end of the musician case it's revealed that Scotch's death was actually a suicide, as he tried to shoot himself to the chest where the bullet would have destroyed his phone where sensitive data is held.\nBoth Shuichi Akai and ironically, Rei (Bourbon / Amuro) played an indirect role in his drive to suicide. Being cornered by Shuichi, who was still undercover at the time, and without realizing his FBI affiliation, Scotch was forced to commit suicide. But as he was about to do finish the act, Shuichi tightly held the gun's cylinder, which prevented Scotch from being able to pull on the trigger. Then Shuichi revealed his true identity and motive, managing to prevent the death. However, in that moment, Rei's hurried footsteps were heard, and both Shuichi and Scotch took that as approaching Black members. Scotch used Shuichi's distraction to pull the trigger, as Rei arrived at the scene after Shuichi retrieved the gun from Scotch's hand. While Rei continued his investigation to try to understand more about Scotch's death, currently his conclusion is that Shuichi forced Scotch to commit suicide.\n",
