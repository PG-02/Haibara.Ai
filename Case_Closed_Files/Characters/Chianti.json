    "Background": "Chianti is a Black Organization sniper, assigned in the assassination division. She is skilled with rifles, and Haibara explains that she and Korn are excellent snipers. However, she is not quite a match for Akai: he is indeed able to fire precisely even at 700 yards or more to 1300 yards, whereas her maximal fire range is 600 yards. Her partner is Korn, and the two are often seen together on missions, just as Gin and Vodka are usually seen together. It is implied that she had some sort of relationship with the deceased member, Calvados, whose death she blames Vermouth for.\n",
    "Appearance": "She usually dresses in black leather suits with a collar. Her left eyelid bears the tattoo of a swallowtail butterfly's wing.\n",
    "Personality": "She is a wild, ruthless assassin who enjoys killing. She is also very impatient, even refusing to stop her car when asked by a construction worker. Gin has cautioned her not to shoot at innocent targets out of boredom. She uses harsh, rude and abusive language. She is scared of the boss even more than she proves to be scared of Gin, and proves to be envious for what Kir has used to make the boss let her join their group four years ago. However, she and Kir have a cordial relation.\n",
    "Abilities": "She is skilled at sniping shown when she and Korn were able to kill someone at practice with their sniping rifle, but she is no match for Akai, because she can only shoot to 600 yards while Akai can shoot until 700 yards or more to 1300 yard. She maybe has some driving skills, as she always drives her blue Dodge Viper.\n",
    "Appellations": "\n",
    "Plot overview": "She is at a shooting stand belonging to the organization, training for the planned murder of a politician. Later, she is present when Gin discusses the time and place of this murder with Kir. Even if she is supposed to participate in the two attempted murders of the mission against the politician and Kogoro, and is, each time, waiting for Gin's order to shoot, she never gets the opportunity to fire until Akai appears, which leads her to complain about having to move for nothing.\nShe is with Korn, driving her car and talking to Gin through her radio. She mentions Kir's capture and entry in the organization.\nWhen the identity of their boss is finally reached, Conan visualizes Karasuma along with Gin, Vodka, a naked Vermouth, Chianti, and Korn.\nGin, Vodka, Vermouth, Korn and herself are hunting down FBI informants in Tokyo, and eventually Kir joins as well, and they attempt to kill Camel, tracking him down to an island across that bay. She is partnered with Vodka at one point, which is the first time as usually she's paired with Korn. The two bump into Camel at one point and they both attempt to kill him, but he escapes. Later, she is present when the others corner Camel and Gin takes the shot.\n",

    "The Raven Chaser (Movie: 13)": "She and Korn are charged by Gin to burst the tires of Takagi's car, and immediately leaves once the task has been executed.

    "Vodka": "",
    "Vermouth": "Vermouth and Chianti are enemies. She hates Vermouth for taking advantage of Calvados' love and getting him killed. Vermouth sometimes taunts her, who does not take it well. In order to avenge Calvados' death, she would've killed Vermouth a long time ago, if she wasn't the boss' favorite, and must work with her due to direct orders from the boss, but swears she'll definitely kill her in the end.\n",
    "Korn": "Korn is Chianti's partner and they are usually seen together. They seem to get along well enough: she confides to Korn that she would like to kill Vermouth because she led Calvados to his death. She may also allow him to take the best part of a mission to please him (that is to say, targeting the head of the victim), in spite of her strong desire to kill by herself. They are not dating[1], but it's clear that she likes him. Indeed, the animation team added an extra scene where Korn blushes when she asks him if he wants to ride the ferris wheel, which in Japan is considered a romantic activity for couples.\n",

    "Trivia": "- Her car is a blue Dodge Viper with two white stripes.

However, he later scrapped that when he found out that snipers don't close their eyes when firing.\n"
