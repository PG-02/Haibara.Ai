He is wearing a hat that is identical to the hat worn by Tsutomu Akai in Shuichi and Mary's flashback images of him. What hair can be seen from under the hat on the back of his head is similar to that of Ethan Hondou. He wears glasses with thick black rims similar to Kohji Haneda's and a button up coat.

For instance, she asks Muga's opinion on Heiji and even sent him to Tokyo so that Iori could see him with his own eyes. Iori approves of Heiji as the choice for her future partner. Iori is also analytic and careful about planning for Momiji, making him a trustworthy butler. During the first encounter with Heiji and Conan where he fell under suspicion of a murder at the Cafe Poirot, Iori easily improvised believable answers for Conan, Heiji, and the police's questions. Iori is apparently also stealthy because Conan and Heiji \"could not feel his presence\" and even the police didn't notice when he later leaves the crime scene.\n",
