    "Red Horse Case (Manga: 394-397, Anime: 325-327)": "He investigates a string of arsons committed by a culprit who leaves red horse dolls at the crime scene. After Heiji's client dies in the fourth fire, he meets the group, including Kogoro, whom he had worked with back when they were officers. Throughout the case, he vehemently believes the prime suspect, Takanori Genda, is innocent as he witnessed first-hand the man's obsessiveness in preventing possible fires. As a relatively competent inspector, he often listened to Heiji and Conan's observations and plans, and even took part in the final deduction. In the end, he cited the two boys as the true heroes of the case.\n",
