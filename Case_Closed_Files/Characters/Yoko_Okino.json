    "Background": "Yoko Okino attended Kohnan High School and had a boyfriend, Akiyoshi Fujie. She began pursuing a career as an idol, which lead Akiyoshi to break up with her after being persuaded by her manager, Eiichi Yamagishi, but he never stopped loving her and wanted to get back to her.[1] She, Ryusuke Higo, and Teiya Asuka were taught by the same teacher.[2]\nShe started her idol career as a member of the quartet \"Earth Ladies\", along with Kaoru Kusano, Yuki Takeno, and Terumi Hoshino. The team was quite successful, but after some time they disbanded to pursue their own careers. She has remained successful and quite popular in the pop idol and acting business.[3]\nIn the beginning of her solo career, she became good friend with another idol, Yuko Ikuzawa. However, at a later date, she got chosen to play a role that was supposed to go to Yuko, which sparked some animosity.[1]\nShe first met Kogoro, Ran, and Conan when she asked for the detective's help in apprehending a stalker who had even penetrated her apartment, and of course Kogoro would not hesitate to take the case. But, in the apartment, they found an unknown man impaled upon a knife, turning this case into a murder investigation. Soon, however, Conan figured out that the victim had actually committed suicide. The man was her old boyfriend, who still cares for him. Sadly, due to a fatal misunderstanding, involving Fujie mistaking Yuko for her, he fell into despair and plunged himself onto a knife, making it appear as if he had been murdered by Yoko in order to take revenge on her. Luckily, Conan found out the truth before damage could be inflicted on her career.[1]\nOvercoming her grief, she has carried on her career and has remained a friend and valuable contact to Kogoro and Conan in the TV and idol industry ever since. She has also gone on to appear in several movies, such as \"Kiss Note\" and \"Zombie Blade\".[4] She has remained close to her former band members throughout the years.\n",
