Rumi clenches up, and Conan notices her gripping something in her pocket. Later one of the other campers is burned alive inside his own tent. Kuroda emerges from an adjacent tent and asks her whether the police should be called. However Rumi is standing in stunned silence, staring forward. When she snaps back to reality, Haibara seems to notice that Rumi can't see out of her right eye. Conan starts to wonder if Rumi is clumsy on purpose or because she cannot see. When Kuroda seems to know the order that everyone introduced themselves in, despite originally claiming to have had earplugs in while sleeping. Rumi accuses him of spying on someone. Rumi has the Detective Boys build an acorn balance toy, which leads to the solution of the case. After Conan and Kuroda uncover the culprit, the culprit uses Ayumi as a hostage, Rumi manages to distract him long enough for Kuroda and Yuminaga to arrest him.

At the mention of good luck charms, Rumi remembers back to when Kohji said, \"With the watchtower bishop, you can be sure of making a good move\", while holding up a shogi bishop. Then he says, \"So they're going to kill me despite that?\" She then remembers him dead, with some sort of blood pouring out of his mouth, and she calls him a \"foolish person\", while pressing down on her right eye and crouching down on the ground. Conan sees her pressing down on her right eye and seems to connect it to an eye disorder. Rumi sees Conan tranquilizing Yamamura to make his deduction and gives a slight smirk. When Ayumi gives a 4-leaf clover to Rumi, saying that because Rumi is clumsy she needs good fortune, Rumi waits for the Detective Boys in front of her to look away, except Conan who is standing behind her looking at her, and throws away the 4-leaf clover.

Then, Mitsuhiko remembered the burning tent case and the reference to the counting system. A flashback of Haibara and Rumi's leg was shown.\n",
    "The Case of Ayumi's Illustrated Diary 3 (Anime: 1087)": "",
    "Plot Exposition": "",
    "Hints that Rumi Wakasa was not Rum": "- The descriptions of Rum were all of a man, but she is a woman.\n- Her name \"Wakasa Rumi\" seems too obvious.\n- Like Kuroda, she perhaps should have recognized Haibara as Sherry and acted against her. However, no action is taken against Haibara despite seeing her five days a week at school.\n- Despite the activation of her Black Organization sense, Haibara says she likes Wakasa.\n- The photo of the bodyguard Asaka, whose face was not shown, may mislead her as the main suspect because Kuroda and Wakita are both men while she is a woman.\n- Rum is a cautious person of whom nobody, not even inside the Black Organization, has an accurate description. If Rumi Wakasa was Rum, she wouldn't have allowed herself to be shown on the news, pro golfer case, with a name so close to the code \"ASACA RUM\". Members of the Black Organization, like Gin and Vodka, believe that he 'messed up' with the Haneda murder, so exposing herself on the news was a risk if she was really Rum.\n- She works as an elementary school teacher, meaning she cannot move around freely to outside of school during working hours and leaving work often will make her more suspicious. If she was Rum and were to move around freely, with or without disguise, there is a possibility that someone will remember her stalking around Mouri Detective Agency.\n- In a flashback, she seems to have been traumatized by Haneda's death. Rum was likely the murderer.\n- In Rumi's flashback, Kohji Haneda is seen dead and bleeding profusely from his mouth. The palm of Kohji's corpse was open. Which implies that Rumi is not the killer and neither took the piece after prying open Kohji's palm, she might have just picked it up after the real killer discarded it at the scene.\n",

    "Conan Edogawa, Ai Haibara, and Detective Boys": "Rumi is the new deputy homeroom teacher for Conan Edogawa, Ai Haibara, and the Detective Boys' class. She has approached them directly twice to lead them to the warehouse of the school that a robber group had used. Rumi is aware of three of Professor Agasa's gadgets given to the Detective Boys: the flashlight watch, the detective badge, and the tranquilizer dart. Among the Detective Boys, Rumi shows special interest in Conan for unknown reasons. In the old warehouse case, Rumi was only paying attention to Conan and purposely used clumsiness in order to give Conan the necessary hints to solve the case. When a murder case occurred in her apartment, Conan found a receipt that has that day's morning and noticed she had bought additional plates and mugs. Conan eventually realized the reason behind his sensei's actions. Rumi sensed a murder might occur in her apartment and was from the very beginning planning to invite the Detective Boys, especially Conan so he would become involved in the case. It seems Rumi is somehow testing Conan's intelligence and skills for unknown reasons.\nRumi at one point seems to trigger Haibara's skill at detecting Black Organization members, but Ai Haibara later tells Conan that she likes Rumi and wants to hear nothing bad said about her. Conan becomes increasingly distrustful of Rumi as time goes on, being reluctant to use his tranquillizer dart in front of her. So in one case, he leads Yamamura, who is to play the role of the sleeping detective here, to a tree to try to evade Rumi's scrutiny. Regardless, she still sees him use the tranquillizer dart on Yamamura and smirks. At one point, Conan notices Rumi pressing down on her right eye and seems to connect it to an eye disorder. Conan sees Rumi throwing away the 4-leaf clover Ayumi gave her and appears angry at her for it. Later, Rumi demonstrated a concerning level of apathy towards the Detective Boys. She allowed them to be thrown in harm's way by letting their teacher, Sumiko, be bait by exchanging umbrellas, allowing her to snipe the Black Organization back.\nRumi has an interest in Ai Haibara since she says she resembles the woman (Ai's mother) who ruined her.[1]\n",
    "Sumiko Kobayashi": "Sumiko Kobayashi is her junior superior as homeroom teacher.\nHowever, in order to distract Chianti and Korn, she deliberately broke the umbrella and exposed Kobayashi to danger, so that she could take the opportunity to attack. This act is similar to \"gambit\" in chess, and was praised by Rum.\n",
    "Ryujiro Uematsu": "Ryujiro Uematsu is the headmaster of her new school.\n",
    "Hyoue Kuroda": "Hyoue Kuroda seems to have some knowledge about her. When he heard that she went camping with the Detective Boys, he comments that camping was something that she wouldn't do. Kuroda suspects it is possible that she thinks him as the murderer who killed Amanda and Haneda, because there was hostility in her eyes. However, it is more likely that she blames Kuroda for not saving them in time.\n",
    "Kohji Haneda": "Rumi Wakasa/Rachel Asaka first met Kohji when she accompanied Amanda seventeen years ago. Kohji said she is his ideal girlfriend while she thought of him as a \"foolish person\" because he sacrificed himself to protect her from the Black Organization. She keeps Kohji's good luck charm, the shogi bishop, which was handed by him and has memories of Kohji hiding her in his bookshelf. His last words were \"Huh? Why did I help you? I decided to do so. I must carry my initial dream through to the end\" still ring in her head as she seeks revenge for both Amanda and Kohji's murders.\n",
    "Tsutomu Akai": "As of now, it is unclear what the relationship Tsutomu and Rumi had. During the beach house murder case, where after Subaru fends off a criminal gang and tells her to bring the Detective Boys to safety, she has a flashback of Tsutomu defending her, saying \"The monster we are about to witness, is not an opponent a young girl should risk her life against, I alone will be enough\". It is left ambiguous what the 'monster' that Tsutomu was referring to is.\n",
    "Name origin": "Gosho Aoyama claims to have named Rumi after Rumiko Takahashi, the author of the manga Urusei Yatsura, whom heroine Lum Invader is performed by her voice actress in the anime.\n"
