    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Heiji and Kazuha take a motorcycle ride to Karakuri Pass, in the Yonago mountains, Tottori Prefecture, but they get lost on their way there. Kazuha remarks on how they forgot their cellphones and have run out of gas, and Heiji yells at her for tagging along when it isn't needed. It turns out Heiji was hired for a nice amount of money by a rich Tottori family to investigate some odd things that have happened in their home, but didn't give him their phone number.\nThe two are close to the forest and don't have camping gear handy, so Heiji says they should just plop down and sleep close together to keep each other warm. Kazuha is flustered at the idea and then gets angry when Heiji adds she that he hopes she won't snore, and them someone appears from behind them and teases them about how couples shouldn't fight. It's an American man named Robert Taylor who is fluent enough in Japanese to understand their banter and acts very familiar towards the two. He mentions a Takeda family that housed him some years ago, and Heiji and Kazuha recognize their surname as the one of the family that hired Heiji, but he's lost, so he cannot really help them to get to their mansion.\nA van passes around and, to call up the attention of the people in it, Heiji throws his helmet towards them. The driver's companion turns out to be Kogoro, who gets very mad at Heiji. Ran and Conan are also with him and they give Heiji, Kazuha and Robert a ride to the Takeda property. It turns out Kogoro was also hired by the Takedas, and for a very high sum of money as well, even sending out one of the family members, third son Yuuzo, to pick the group up in their van. He and Heiji discuss how the cards they also got from the family are rather odd and refer to a \"spider\". Yuzo Takeda explains a \"spider curse\" that has befallen the Takeda family and their home, known as the \"Spider Mansion of Tottori\", one that no criminal should get close to.\n\n\nWhen the group arrives at the Takeda household, Robert is devastated to learn that Misa, who had taken care of him on his last visit, killed herself by hanging soon after his departure. Her mother Kinuyo and the family friend/associate Akio Negishi also committed suicide in a similar way. The one who relays the news is Youko, Yuzo's sister-in-law, who has just come from Tokyo alongside her husband Ryuuji and their kids Sae and Emi. Negishi was the business partner of Nobukazu Takeda, a famous doll-maker and Misa's father, as well as the one who actually hired Kogoro.\nNobukazu is surprised to see that Kogoro has brought several people with him, and he makes Heiji, Kazuha and Conan pass off as Ran's friends. He then talks briefly to Robert, who thanks him for letting him stay around some time ago. The twin girls Sae and Emi also arrive, but when Robert greets them cheerfully, they quietly call him \"murderer\" and accuse him of coming to kill people again before their mother scolds them and they run away. The matriarch of the family, Chie, also watches them from a distance.\n\nKazuha is attacked with a stun gun after discovering some BB pellets. While searching, Heiji notices that the warehouse door that he closed, was open and the criminal runs before Kazuha is killed. The twins claim that Robert wrote \"Die\" on a note to Misa.\n\nThe trick used in the murder is revealed.\n",

    "Resolution": "He murdered Nobukazu by luring him to the lodge where the Takeda females committed suicide via telephone call. He would threaten to reveal his operation if he did not comply. Before this was set, he laid massive piles of silk thread in the attic, with one particular thread tied in the manner of a slingshot by the window. He lured Nobukazu to this position and to have him peek his head out by firing BB gun rounds against the pane. The instant he peeks out Robert would pull a string that would release the slingshot mechanism: effectively snapping Nobukazu's neck and leaving him dangling in silk threads much like the yokai curse. This was done at the time he was leaving to view constellations at an observation point on a motorbike (truck in the anime) so as to create an alibi.\n",
    "Remastered version": "On October 29, 2007, a remastered version of the case was aired. All three episodes were edited and combined into one hour long special, and scenes were edited out to fit the timeslot.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The story of the spider demon is an allusion to Jorōgumo, a figure of Japanese mythology.\n- In the last part of the case, the opening was changed to Mysterious Eyes.\n- Sae and Emi Takeda were seen again later on in the series as the Next Conan Hint: Twins.\n",
