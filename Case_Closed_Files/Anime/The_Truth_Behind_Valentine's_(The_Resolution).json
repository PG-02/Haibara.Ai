The females there start making chocolate as gifts for the one they love. Sonoko makes hers for Makoto and Ran leaves hers nameless. A snowstorm occurs and the photographer is found dead by Conan and the dog named Saburo.\n\nThe mystery continues and they develop the film on the camera to find droplets of blood on it. Apparently, the murder takes place before the snowstorm but Conan feels like there's a trick to it. The characters are given more back story.\nWhile examining the chocolates, Conan figures out who the murderer is. Kogoro pops in finding Conan snooping around and is put to sleep.
