    "Situation": "When Conan came back home at the Mouri Detective Agency, Kogoro learns that Ran is going to sleep over at school for karate practice. Kogoro asks Ran about dinner but is told to go to the Café Poirot. However, the café is closed. Kogoro checks others restaurants but all are closed. In the end, Kogoro reserves to eat a place called Ramen Ogura.\nAs Conan went to the restroom to wash his hands but he suddenly heard Ogura telling a man named Tokumori Saizu to get out of his restaurant. Saizu retorts and pokes fun at the restaurant's slow business. It turns out that Ogura and Sayo hates Saizu since Saizu hires men cause trouble at their shop, resulting in their poor reputation and business. Saizu's plan was to put the ramen shop out of business, and build his own plans in place.\nMeanwhile, Saizu sits down next to Conan and orders some ramen to eat. Another man named Atsushi Taninaka enters and takes a seat to order a ramen as well.\nSayo brought the Death Lord ramen for Kogoro and Conan. Sayo also gave the Death Lord ramen to Saizu, who picks up the chopsticks with his left hand. When he's about to eat, he mentions that if someone died after eating the ramen, the shop would consequently go out of business. This would do him a big favor. After hearing the statement, Kogoro gets mad and told him that he should stop being so disrespectful, but Saizu didn't answer. Kogoro grabs Saizu's collar in his anger and suddenly Saizu collapses and dies.\n\nKogoro tells Sayo to call an ambulance but Conan tells her to call the police also. Someone poisoned him. Inspector Megure and Detective Takagi have arrived and gets the information from Kogoro of what happened. After the conversation of the case, Taninaka told Inspector Megure that Kogoro grabbed Saizu's collar so he told him to get out with the other people while the police will investigate. Conan is sure that one of the three people had the chance to poison Saizu.\nThe police reveal poison was only found on the victim's left thumb and forefinger causing them to be dumbfounded on how poison was applied. Conan asks the police on what possessions the suspects have and eventually realizes how Saizu was killed.\n",
