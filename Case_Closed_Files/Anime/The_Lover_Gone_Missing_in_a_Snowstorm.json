While the Detective Boys start a snowball fight, Genta goes inside the boarding house to clean his face. Conan looks for Genta after a while. Conan accidentally overhears an argument between Juri Himuro and Aya Himuro. Aya protests against Juri having Masahiko Fujita as a boyfriend. Masahiko and Juri run off. Genta then exits the kitchen, which is next to Conan. Conan goes into the kitchen to see where Genta had gone, but he gets promptly kicked out by Ryoko Himuro. In the meantime, Haibara had been making minature snow animals sculptures. Aya then comes from the mountain path.\nDuring dinner, Ayumi is put off by the scent of garlic. This causes Conan to wonder because there isn't garlic in the food. After dinner, Aya reminds Juri to take her medication, but it disappeared. Masahiko goes out in the snowstorm to get medicine for her. A phone call comes from the hospital saying that her boyfriend hadn't arrived. They all begin to wonder because he should have arrived a long time ago. Juri calls his mobile but he doesn't answer. Excluding Juri, they all go out looking for him. Conan discovers his corpse off the cliff of perilous a narrow path.\n\nThe police are not able to come but Conan preserves the scene. Professor Agasa thinks it's an accident but Conan has his doubts. Conan finds some fragments of something shiny in the snow. He continues to wonder why Masahiko chose the dangerous path. The sisters reply because it's faster. Conan asks if she was into town this afternoon because they saw her coming from there. When back in the lodge, Juri breaks down and blames herself. That night, Conan sitting thinking on the steps when he hears a door squeak open. He discovers 'Monaka ice' in the store room. That night Juri suffers a coughing bout.
