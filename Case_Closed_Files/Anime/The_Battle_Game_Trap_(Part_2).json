    "Situation": "Sonoko, Ran, and Conan are at the arcade where they meet their High School English teacher, Jodie Starling, who is an avid gamer. Jodie introduces Ran to a virtual reality fighting game which uses mechanics to simulate a real fight. Ran loses to a gamer named Kengo Bito who taunts her in her loss. Bito plays the game again against his rival, Takayasu Shimizu; The battle is projected on a large screen. Bito's avatar overwhelms Shimizu's but stops at the climax of the match. The people in the arcade realize Bito is dead and the police are called in.\n\nThe police investigate. After reviewing the security camera's footage, they limit the suspects down to four people, a middle aged man, an employee, Shimizu, and Jodie.\nThe autopsy reveals the poison to be Tetrodotoxin (TTX), a poison that causes instant paralysis and death soon after. Conan investigates and learns the method and the culprit who murdered Bito.\n",
    "People": "- 28 years old\n- English teacher\n- Victim (poison)\n- 21 years old\n- Unemployed\n- 22 years old\n- Arcade staff\n- 41 years old\n- Taxi driver\n- 30 years old\n- Game magazine writer\n- Takayasu's sister\n- Kengo's girlfriend\n",
    "Resolution": "To dispose of the murder weapon, Conan explains Shimizu hid the poisoned needle tip inside a cigarette, and placed the cigarette on a gum wrapper with a piece of chewed gum sandwiched in between. Someone, who by coincidence happened to be Dejima, would accidentally step on the paper and transport the murder weapon away. The decisive evidence that Shimizu is the culprit is a coin in Bito's arcade machine with Shimizu's fingerprints. Since Bito was dead, Shimizu himself had to put a coin in Bito's machine in order to start their final match.\nBito was a gambler habitually in debt, and Shimizu's sister had worked endlessly trying to pay it off. She didn't even eat which caused her to develop Vitamin A deficiency that descended into blindness. Shimizu made a deal with Bito that if he beat him in the fighting game as Haido Lucas then Bito would leave his sister and say that he regret doing it since he never get a chance to beat him.\n",
