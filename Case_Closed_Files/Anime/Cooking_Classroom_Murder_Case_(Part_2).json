    "Situation": "Sonoko tricks Ran into attending a cooking class by famous French chef Michi Uemori, and in order to go she invites her father and Conan. When the group arrives, they met several other people: Uemori's assistant, Yuko Komiyama, Michi's daughter-in-law Kaoru, and the cooking students Kazue Yashiro and Hiroaki Nishitani. Finally, the cooking class teacher Michi Uemori shows up. Conan, Ran, and Kogoro learn everyone seems to have something against the instructor, who is also a very unpleasant person. At some point the lights go out, then Uemori gets stabbed in the back and her lung is punctured, causing her to die. Now Conan and Kogoro have to decipher four suspects's agenda against her, but can they find the killer?\n\nAll four students are found to be suspects in Uemori's murder, and it appears a needle or another small object is to be to blame. Conan begins to search for locations that could hide a needle. Can any person be proven to be the culprit?\n",
    "People": "- 24 years old\n- Michi's assistant\n- 52 years old\n- Michi's friend\n- 25 years old\n- Michi's daughter-in-law\n- 29 years old\n- French restaurant owner\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- 52 years old\n- Cooking classroom teacher\n- Tokyo MPD forensics officer\n- Tokyo MPD policewoman\n- Michi's only son\n- Kaoru's husband\n",
    "Resolution": "The murder weapon was a very thin sewing needle, which Nishitani hid in his fountain pen. When he had excused himself to go to the bathroom he set up a block of ice under the breaker, along with a wire attached to a ring and large weight. When the ice melted, the weight would go down and as a result would pull the wire connected to the ring on the breaker switch. He also put on special contact lenses, tinted contact lenses that kept his pupils shielded from the light.\nOnce the trick to turn off the lights had darkened the entire house, he opened the back door, removed his contact lenses and was able to make out just enough to take out the sewing needle and swiftly pierce Uemori's lung with it, knowing that due to her respiratory problems she would soon die. To not harm his fingers, he used his ring to push the needle further, and then took it out pulling the string tied to it, using as a makeshift thimble; this was easily seen when it turned out Nishitani was the only person among the suspects wearing a ring on his fingers.\nAs evidence the contact lenses he used were found in his mixing bowl, as well as the sewing needle in his ink pen. He confesses and states that he did not do this for himself, but for the girl he loved. Uemori had stolen Yuko’s recipes and passed them off as her own, this made him furious as he was alright with being the victim but when it came to the girl he loved that’s were he drew the line.\n",

    "Trivia": "- Shortly after the class started, Kogoro bent down to ask Conan, \"What's a Champignon?,\" apparently knowing the 7 year old boy knew that it was the French word for \"Mushroom\".\n- As Kogoro was talking about how Kaoru Uemori used her eyepatch so her covered eye, so when it went dark, she could see, which was proven to be plausable, by the Mythbusters in their pirate specials.\n- The painting with flowers reappears in Tachibana villa from The Bay of Revenge, in Kaze no Lalala, and in Kataoka house from The Kidnapper's Disappearing Getaway Car.
