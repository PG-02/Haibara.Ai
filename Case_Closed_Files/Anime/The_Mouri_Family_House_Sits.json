    "Situation": "Takahiko Kamiyu, a literary critic, entrusted Kogoro with the responsibility of staying at his house and watching over it for three days while he visited the countryside. Owing to the high payment, Kogoro swiftly accepted, even though he previously thought it did not befit formal detective work as he was hired to take care of Kamiyu's cat. However, a noticeable matter was the emergence of the construction noise on the second day of their stay. The Mouri family - while enjoying residential at Kamiyu's place, realized the fact that several visitors dropped in consecutively.\n\n",
