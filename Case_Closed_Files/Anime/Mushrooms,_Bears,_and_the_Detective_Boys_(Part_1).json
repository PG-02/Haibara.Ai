    "Situation": "The Detective Boys decide to go mushroom picking in the North-East mountains. Unfortunately, Genta gets lost in the hunting area while picking up mushrooms, and the Detective Boys have to split into two groups to search for Genta. But while searching of Genta, Haibara and Mitsuhiko encounter a dead body in the woods, and have become the targets of a dangerous hunter.\n\n\nOnce Genta is found, three hunters decide to help them by looking for Haibara and Mitsuhiko.\n",
    "People": "- 41 years old\n- Hunter\n- 67 years old\n- Hunter\n- Former matagi\n- 28 years old\n- Hunter\n- Female Asiatic bear\n- Victim (gunshot)\n- Hunter\n- Ryokan employee\n- Jubei's son\n- Deceased (gunshot)\n- Jubei's son\n",
    "Resolution": "\n\nJubei had saved Saika from freezing to death when he had broken both his legs hunting for Jubei, and the rescue team, mistaking Jubei's intentions and thinking she had wanted to eat him, had taken out her eye when saving him. Since then he had been trying to keep her safe, spreading lies about her being a ferocious beast so no one would approach her. But when the unnamed hunter killed the cub and used it as a part of a trap for Jubei, he resorted to more desperate measures, and as a result he accidentally shot the hunter dead, and then gave the dead cub a burial.\nAi's clue when telling Conan about the culprit was a set of mushrooms on a stick. They were mounted mimicking the way the suspects were carrying their rifles. But it had not been the poisonous mushroom out of the three buf the type Agasa had earlier called 'the culprit'.\n\n",

    "Quotes": "- Ai Haibara's advice to Mitsuhiko when he felt upset about using what he learnt from Conan:\nSilly you. The important thing is not whom you learned of that knowledge from. But rather, where and how you use it. You're the best rescue person around for me right now. Thank you. You sure are a great help...  (バカね、大切なのはその知識を誰に聞いたかじゃなく、どこでそれを活用するか。今のあなたは私にとって最高のレスキュー隊員よ！ありがと助かったわ…)\n"
