    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan driving in a rented car late somewhere in the Shizuoka mountains when suddenly the car breaks down. Being all dark outside and with fog everywhere, Ran starts to freak out. Not long after, they notice a car right in front of them turning into a small passageway, through the mountains, which they haven't noticed before because of the fog. They decide to walk and take the passageway in the hope of finding help nearby. They eventually come across a building that belongs to a company named \"Kuron Health Appliance Company - Training and Product Development Facility\". There are some cars in the parking lot and some of them are still hot, which Conan figures were recently used and that one of them is most certainly the car they noticed earlier. After ringing at the door, a man shows up but almost immediately asks them to leave in an unwelcoming tone. After locking the door and disappearing inside, another man shows up 15 seconds later telling them to come in. Once inside, the same man who tried to push them away loudly expresses his disapproval for letting them in saying they could be \"spies\". Suddenly, the company owner comes out of his office quite upset about all the noise. Kogoro quickly tries to reassure them all saying they're not suspects and that he's a private detective, Kogoro Mouri. The owner, a Black belt in karate, immediately adopts a friendlier attitude and apologizes for being so ignorant. He then offers his business card to Kogoro introducing himself as Umetani, the owner of the Kuron Healthiness Instrument Stock Company.\n\n\n",
    "People": "- Victim (stabbed-injured)\n- 45 years old\n- Kuron Health Appliances Company president\n- 40 years old\n- Development Department 1 director\n- 42 years old\n- Development Department 2 director\n- Victim (car accident)\n- 33 years old\n- Development Department 3 director\n- Shizuoka Prefecture policeman\n- Shiro's late father\n- Kuron Health Appliances Company ex-president\n- Haruo's son\n- Child\n",
    "Resolution": "He cut off the braking fluid of the victim's car and adjusted the position of a roadway mirror so that Hiramatsu would be blinded by the reflection of his own headlights and fall to his death. To further ensure he died, all the other cars had their tires punctured so that the victim could only use his. The competition for the model chair design of the company's was also delayed so that the murder could occur when there was fog, completely impairing the victim's vision.\nUmetani pretended that he would refuse to auction the model and keep the victim as his subordinate but the deal had already been made. Umetani could not resist selling such a well designed chair and Hiramatsu blackmailed the president to let him leave the company having already preprogrammed the chair to self detonate after midnight.\nIn the surveillance video, Hiramatsu was talking to the president about the password necessary to stop the detonation. He later impulsively stabs Umetani twice, the first out of blind rage that his initial murder plan failed and second because he was goaded by Umetani to finish the job, lest the president come after him with a warrant. Specifically Umetani tells Hiramatsu to stab him at the letter O of the massage chair apparatus to fatally kill him. However he prepared the cheap cigar case to block the stab beforehand. The fact that the Umetani model refuses to self-destruct confirms the transaction in the mute video and that the president killed Hiramatsu. A digital recording of Hiramatsu's voice entailing the deal seals the case.\n",
