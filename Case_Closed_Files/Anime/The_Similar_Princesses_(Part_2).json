    "Situation": "Kogoro is hired by the wife of a rich man named Mikio Fujieda to find out who wants to kill him and had been promised ¥10 million after solving the case. Kogoro however spends ¥8 million(¥3 million from three days of party, another ¥5 from horse race and gambling in order to find money to pay back the former cost) and is unable to solve the case. Ran decides to call her mother, Eri Kisaki, to help solve the mystery. Conan, Ran, and Eri head to Fujieda's mansion to investigate only to run into Conan's mother, Yukiko who is investigating the mystery in place of her husband Yusaku. The two mothers reminiscence about a high-school pageant and how it ended in a tie due to a person not handing in their ballot. Ran reveals that Kogoro has an unhanded ballot from the contest which sparks the interest of the two. Later that night, Fujieda is caught on a camera after being shot.\n\nConan investigates and realizes who the murderer is after receiving a hint from his father.\n",
    "People": "- 69 years old\n- Fujieda family butler\n- 61 years old\n- Fujieda family gardener\n- From Kochi Prefecture\n- 47 years old\n- Mikio Fujieda's brother-in-law\n- Victim (gunshot)\n- 58 years old\n- Head of the Fujieda family\n- 26 years old\n- Mikio Fujieda's wife\n- Kogoro's client\n- Deceased\n- Fujieda family heiress\n- Shigeru's sister\n- Mikio's former wife\n- Italian restaurant waiter\n- Eri's client\n- Fujieda family maid\n- Fujieda family maid\n- Fujieda family maid\n- Fujieda family maid\n- Fujieda family maid\n- Tokyo MPD police officer\n- Tokyo MPD police officer\n",
    "Resolution": "As evidence, Conan reveals that the coffee the butler served should contain traces of Isoprenaline and that the butler should have the silencer on him. Ueki confesses and reveals he murdered Fujieda in order to preserve the garden his former mistress cherished and worked so hard to build. Mikio's will was then read that he will not give his inheritance to those who could not protect his life and Motoka was forced to sell her possession to pay Eri, Kogoro, and Yukiko for total of 10 million yen according to laws No. 415.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga, Yukiko wears a cross necklace as an accessory. This is changed to a silver \"l\" in the anime to avoid doing any religious reference.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Detective Takagi's appearance changes a bit starting from this episode, most notably his shirt (from sky blue to light grey) and necktie (from blue to bluish dark gray).\n- This case marks Midori Kuriyama's first canon appearance.\n- This case also revealed that Yukiko was already a gifted actress, and Eri, even at the age of 16, received an offer to study at Harvard.\n- This is one of the first cases, of not the only case, where Yukiko almost blew Conan Edogawa's identity.\nYukiko quickly covered it up by saying, \"My Grandpa's sister's daughter's cousin's uncle's grandson.\"\nIn The Cornered Famous Detective! Two Big Murder Cases, she told Ran that Conan \"happens to be my grandfather's older brother's daughter's cousin's uncles' grandson.\"\nDuring that case before Conan settled on knocking out Misao Yamamura to solve the case, he asked Yukiko to lipsync while he used his voice changing bow tie to make his deduction, like he had previously done with Agasa in episode 63, and while she refused then, she does so in this episode which may be a subtle callback to the aforementioned Mysterious Uncle Case.\n- Yukiko quickly covered it up by saying, \"My Grandpa's sister's daughter's cousin's uncle's grandson.\"\n- In The Cornered Famous Detective!
