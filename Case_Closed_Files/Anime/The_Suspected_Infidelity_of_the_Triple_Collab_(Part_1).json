    "Situation": "Whilst the Detective Boys and Agasa were eating, they were simultaneously discussing such topics concerning the hit music bands presently. That was when they contended Tokumi Nagasu, Sumika Kokonoe, and Mao Toya; supposedly the three of them are fans for that band. Under the lead of their friend - the waitress Yasuko Aijima, they absently sat on their respective seats. Thereafter, Ayumi, Genta, and Mitsuhiko, who happened to be inside the restaurant, discovered the presence of Mrs. Kobayashi, Detective Chiba, and Shukichi Haneda. Considering the fact that each had their appropriate matches, every single lover would chill down.\nAt that time, the Detective Boys have decided to watch the love scenes of each person they met earlier, however when they returned, it was very strange: Kobayashi was eating with Chiba, while Taiko Meijin was eating with Naeko, and Shiratori was eating with Yumi; this shocks Conan while Haibara prepares to investigate and clarify and criticize this Triple Collab. However, before that happened, they notices Tokumi Nagasu suddenly falls off in her chair and seems to have died after eating the cake, this makes the whole group scream, attracting an even greater sky of anger than when the one that the Detective Boys just followed notice the scream.\nThey are very surprised when they meet each other at first and begin to question their respective match:\n- Yumi starts asking Shukichi about Naeko first but before the latter can even defend herself, Shukichi asks about Yumi going out to eat with the broccoli-head, whom Shiratori’s hair looks similar to, which Shiratori didn't care about that much.\n- Instead, he asks Kobayashi about Chiba, and before Kobayashi can say anything, Chiba answers quickly because he himself had no motive.\n- When it is Chiba's turn to question Shukichi, he panics while Naeko asks Chiba back.\nUntil Conan interrupts this meaningless fighting so everyone can even focus on the poisoned victim.\nChiba is the one to start asking about the victim but Conan has already gotten the full information about the victim and just told Chiba, much to Naeko's surprise. This was because Agasa's group had divided the task of asking the victim's friends while the six were arguing. Haibara explains why they didn't let Sato and Takagi come, and from there forces the six of them to solve the poisoning case and give an explanation for today's incident in a fierce manner. So with that attitude, Shiratori sends everyone out immediately, much to most annoyance since they usually let them on the scene.\nThe police start questioning the suspects one by one:\n- Starting with Aijima, she says that there might be maritozzi next month and her friends happened to be coming today so she wanted everyone to try it as a way to get feedback because those three friends always care about the taste of a dish. She was considered the most likely culprit because she was the one who prepared the dish, but Kokonoe turned the plate away when she wanted to take a picture and post it on social media. She also mentions the conflict between Nagasu and Kokonoe because Kokonoe broke her promise to only watch The Knight Hearts.\n- Next is Kokonoe, she says that this was the first time she saw Toya dividing the food into separate plates, probably because Nagasu had eaten Toya's pizza while the latter was in the bathroom and the sooner was drunk. Then the two of them argued loudly over the said pizza.\n- Finally, Toya, she confirms and is a bit surprised about Kokonoe's statement, she also mentions about dividing the pizza and why she did it. In addition, she also explains the reason for choosing this place as the meeting place because the previous times at the cafe in Haido City were boring enough, so Nagasu wanted to come here once.\nWhile the three guys forget about solving the case and continue arguing because the testimony seem to not point out the culprit, Naeko and Kobayashi are seen discussing letting Conan join in solving the case, meanwhile, Conan sneezes because someone has mentioned him whilst hoping that this long-winded case could end soon.\nWhat has to happen, happens, Conan receives a call from Yumi and is informed about the crime scene, the suspect's testimony, Conan also asks her some small questions about the victim and is immediately answered with the crime scene recording at that time. And with the selfie of the group of 4 people, Conan also realizes the truth of the case. However, suddenly before that, Yumi suddenly saw the heart symbol on the 7th of this month in Kobayashi's notebook when they were looking for Agasa's number to send the security tape, from there they decided to solve this case without Conan. But are the two people's deductions similar?\n",
    "People": "- Victim (poison)\n- 29 years old\n- Pet shop employee\n- Customer\n- 29 years old\n- Bookstore employee\n- Customer\n- 29 years old\n- Apparel shop employee\n- Customer\n- 29 years old\n- Danny's waitress\n- \"The Knight Hearts\" leader\n- \"The Knight Hearts\" member\n- \"The Knight Hearts\" member\n- \"The Knight Hearts\" member\n- \"The Knight Hearts\" fan\n- Movie character\n- Female Kamen Yaiba\n- Real name: Fuuko\n- Birthday girl\n- Danny's waitress\n- Danny's waitress\n- Danny's waitress\n- Tokyo MPD forensics officer\n",
    "Resolution": "Yasuko had actually poisoned the first chair Tokumi was sitting on and also purposely made it wobbly. When Tokumi notices the wobbliness, she'll think that her weight had broke the chair, and would sneakily try to swap to a different chair. When the lights went out for a little girl’s birthday celebration cake, Tokumi begin swapping her chair by grabbing the bottom while having it pressed against her legs and bottom, in this way avoiding the sounds created from dragging a chair. But by doing so, Tokumi had gotten the poison on her hands. After swapping the poisoned chair with the chair at the table beside, the poisoned chair, being at a different table, would now be considered irrelevant to the murder and there is less chance it would be checked for poison.\nAll Tokumi had to do was eat something with her hands and that would guarantee her death. Yasuko knew which chair Tokumi would sit on because in every group photo they’ve ever taken, Tokumi always stood on the right, believing that she looked better from that angle. After taking the group photo, everyone would naturally take the closest seat, thus Tokumi would always be sitting on the right. She also made sure that the group would sit at the table with poisoned chair by reserving that table for the group.\n",
    "Motive": "Mao and Sumika furiously ask why she would do such a thing as one wrong mistake could have killed them as well. However, she coldly states that she didn’t care as she wanted them all dead for causing the death of the former Knight Hearts member Kenya Shibumi.\nKenya had been secretly dating someone and he had been exposed after a photo of him with his girlfriend was posted online after a fan took the photo. His girlfriend was revealed to be Yasuko and after his relationship was exposed to the public, his reputation was ruined and he found it harder to produce music and get more sponsors. As a result, he resorted to drinking and one day when he was stumbling across the street intoxicated, he was hit by a car and killed.\nYasuko, being devastated, decided to track down the person who took and posted the photo. It turned out to be a female fan, who she asked to meet at a diner, where she told the fan that she and Kenya were genuinely in love and that the fan had no right to tell the world about them. However, to her shock, the fan revealed that she had learned about Kenya's whereabouts from Tokumi. To add insult to injury, she learned that Mao and Sumika were also present with Tokumi when this happened and they did nothing to stop her. This is why she wanted to kill mainly Tokumi, but also Mao and Sumika for betraying her and for causing the death of the man she loved.\n- Deceased (Car Accident)\n- Former \"The Knight Hearts\" member\n- Aijima's boyfriend\n\n",
    "Aftermath": "Conan reveals to Haibara that the reason why Chiba, Shiratori, Shukichi, Naeko, Kobayashi, and Yumi had been meeting at that diner was because the three girls told their boyfriends about meeting on the 8th for a special event. The three men believed it to be a romantic date of some sort, and decided to consult the other girls for help to buy a gift for their respective girlfriends.\nIronically, Conan also reveals that all three girls had planned to go to a “Knight Hearts” concert with their boyfriends. They are shown together at the concert, the men, while reluctant at first, decide to enjoy the concert to the fullest.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- Several scenes and dialogues are added in anime version:\n- Haibara glaring at Conan when he intercepted her from investigating possible infidelity.\n- Chiba thanking Conan for summarizing the victim and suspects' information.\n- Naeko, after saying that Conan is just like a police officer, wonder if she should say a detective, with Chiba expression changed as she said that.\n- When Yasuko mentioned that Sumiko cheated with another band, Yumi and Naeko immediately look at Chiba and Shiratori.\n- Detective Boys singing \"Bokura no Yume sa Kamen Yaiba\", and later sleeping.\n- Conan sneezing after Kobayashi, Yumi, and Naeko talked about their ace-in-the-hold that they are all familiar with, followed by Haibara hoping the case can be solved soon so that she could know how the three-couple drama ends.\n- The photograph of Kenya and Yasuko that made Kenya quit the band.\n- In the manga, after Conan received the camera footage from Yumi, he first reviewed on how Nagasu initially sat down and then ate french fries. This part is not adapted into anime.\n- In the manga, Yasuko mentioned that Mao and Sumika were there when Tokumi met Kenya's fan. Their appearance in that flashback is only shown in anime version.\n",
