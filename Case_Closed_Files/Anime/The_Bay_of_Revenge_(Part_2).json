    "Situation": "While driving on a family trip in Chiba, Kogoro's car breaks down. They stop by a house on the bay, where Kogoro, Ran, and Conan meet the famous and corrupt Tokyo lawyer Kensuke Tachibana and his secretary Yuuichi Sakuraba, and later they meet his caretaker Yaeko Kamei, his wife Yuki Tachibana, and his office's accountant Noriko Sugimura and lawyer Fumio Fujisawa. Tachibana is getting threatening letters from a man with the initials \"T.K.\" The next morning, the dog Yohan is acting strangely. Tachibana leaves the house for a fishing trip, while Kogoro, Ran, and Conan walk the dog. It reacts wildly when it sees a suspicious person in a red hat, on a boat. Later that day, Tachibana's boat is found, halfway sinking, and his body is found deep in the ocean.\n\nA local detective and his assistant arrive at the scene, and the man with the initials \"T.K.\" is found out to be Tatsuya Kumada, an old client of the lawyer, and becomes the number one criminal. However, when they go to his apartment, they find him dead, seemingly hanging himself in a suicide.\n\nHowever, the clues say otherwise. Could someone have killed both the lawyer and the client?\nConan discovers that, five years before, a man was killed in a \"perfect crime\" by the man who had killed himself, with the initials \"T.K.\"\n\nConan uses this clue, as well as other clues via help from an old boat rental owner, to deduce how the lawyer was killed. He then visits the old home where the man who was killed five years before lived with his mother and his younger brother, and gets information from an old lady there, and discovers a dog house sign that says \"Johann\". Conan had finally figured it out who the real murderer is.\n",

    "Resolution": "Tamiko confesses and reveals her second son Katsuhiko Tsuruta died last year and says Yohan is her only family and says that she lied, saying he was a stray dog, and they started living in Tachibana's villa and reveals she fought many times at court, but no one noticed her, the court's decision was unfair and grew old because of that and then half a year ago, Kumada finally appeared and she overheard the washing machine trick outside the office's door. In jail, Kumada said he would pay any amount of money, even though Tachibana knew that Kumada murdered Masahiko, he acquitted Kumada of the crime for money. That day, she followed Kumada to his apartment with his hat that he left, she thought of this crime and Kogoro via Conan reveals the threat that looked like they were from Kumada, Yaeko was sending them to Tachibana. And Yaeko says: \"Since yesterday, I have been so scared, I'm finally relieved.\"\n",
    "Trivia": "- The policemen Baba and Inoki are modeled after the real-life Japanese professional wrestlers Giant Baba and Antonio Inoki.[1]\n- Instead of \"Tsuruta\", the old house's sign is \"Turuta,\" which is an example of either Nihon-shiki or Kunrei-shiki romanization.\n- In Tachibana villa, the painting with a castle is from the Opal coffee in Kogoro Mouri, Suspect; the one with a forest appeared in Suzuki ship from The Last Wizard of the Century and in Beika Sun Plaza Hotel from Captured in Her Eyes; the one with flowers appeared in Uemori household from Cooking Classroom Murder Case and also reappears in Kataoka house from The Kidnapper's Disappearing Getaway Car and in Kaze no Lalala; and the one with mountains reappears in Beika Central Hospital from Captured in Her Eyes, in Hotel Arimori from The Black Wings of Icarus, and in the ropeway cabin from The Entrance to the Maze: The Anger of the Colossus.
