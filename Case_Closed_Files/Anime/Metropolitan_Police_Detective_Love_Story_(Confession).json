    "Situation": "While at the parking lot, Sato was disappointed at something because it might be embarrassing, while Takagi said that he will take responsibility. Yumi and Naeko overheard and thought that Sato is pregnant.\nConan, Haibara, and the Detective Boys bumped a fellow Teitan Elementary student, Noriya Makabe at a convenience store. Noriya invited the Detective Boys to his cousin's apartment, Toshinari Shiga to play a game. After they went into Toshinari's apartment, Conan sensed something is suspicious and started to search the apartment. Conan asked Noriya if his brother just moved there, and Noriya replied he moved about a month ago and Toshinari is not his brother, but his cousin. His parents are away, so Noriya will be staying with his cousin for a week. Noriya also said Toshinari's sister died in a traffic accident 6 months ago, and his mom asked him to stay with him and cheer him up. While showing Toshinari's sister's picture album to Conan, they suddenly heard a scream from the hallway. The scream was Toshinari's and there was a murder next to his apartment. Haibara contacted the police and Conan suspects Toshinari is the murderer.\n\nYumi is seen to be explaining to other police detectives of what she and Naeko overheard from Sato and Takagi's conversation, while Naeko is accompanying her. Sato and Takagi continues the investigation including about Toshinari's sister's accident. Toshinari explained that after the accident happened, he would lay flowers at the scene everyday. Takagi replied that the flower seems like a bit of a gaudy choice and he also explained he chose the flower because her sister loved pink color. Conan then asked \"Was your sister having any problems? For example, a stalker or something, maybe?\". Toshinari seems to be shocked at first but after Sato asked, he quickly replied \"No\". Conan becomes sure Toshinari is the murderer but he has an alibi. After Conan solves the case, he asked Haibara to let the others go somewhere else. He then intimidates the murderer and gives out hints towards Sato and Takagi.\n",

    "Resolution": "Hiroto knew that Mika was pinned under the car she was hit by but said nothing and fled out of fear. Despite her death he kept photos that he took when stalking her, and in front of these photos he blamed Mika for dying because she ran away from him. Shiga who had been spying on him from outside his window saw this and was infuriated, when he confronted Hiroto he asked why did he not call an ambulance for her? Why did he not tell the paramedics that she was pinned under the car? Why did he run away? Hiroto simply said that he scared because of what happened and he did not know what to do.\n",
