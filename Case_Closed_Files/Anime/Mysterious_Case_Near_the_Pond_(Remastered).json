As the group discovers the real owner of the snapping turtle, Izumi Kimata, they are surprised to find a man named Jiro Nihonmatsu claiming that it's his turtle. Nihonmatsu says he wants to raise the turtle to make up for mistreating his own pet, a green turtle, when he was younger, so Kimata agrees to allow him to raise it. When the animal control officers discover that there's four snapping turtles altogether Nihonmatsu decides to raise all four and makes some unusual statements about turtles causing Conan to become suspicious of him.\n",
