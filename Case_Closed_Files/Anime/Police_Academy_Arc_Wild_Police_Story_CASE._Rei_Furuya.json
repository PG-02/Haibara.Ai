    "Story": "The day when the police academy students graduate has come. After Rei, Hiro, and Matsuda have returned from the convenience store, they met Hagiwara and Date, who have been searching for them because the ceremony is starting soon. At the police academy gate, the five of them encountered Sato and Yumi, who were admiring the Mazda RX-7 that was parked near the gate. Matsuda warned the girls not to touch the car before Hagiwara came to calm him down. Rei then asked if Sato and Yumi are interested in the police and suggested that they should watch the graduation ceremony.\nDuring the ceremony, Matsuda said that Rei and him accompanied Hiro taking a photo which will be attached in the letter that Hiro will send to his brother. Matsuda secretly drew stubble on Hiro's chin in that photo, which made others react negatively. However, Hiro was impressed with the result, and the others realized that Hiro has changed. Later, a speech was conducted by the superintendent general, and Hagiwara said that it is the greatest opportunity for Matsuda, since he wanted to punch the superintendent general at the outset, Rei got afraid that Matsuda will genuinely punch the superintendent general, accordingly, he requested Hiro and Date to quickly hold Matsuda back. Nontheless, Matsuda said that he wouldn't punch the superintendent general like as he was a kid. After a while, the diplomas awarding began, with Rei as class representative.\nBack to the present, Amuro is working at Café Poirot, recalling some wise words from his friends and their deaths while doing things. While cooking, he remembers Hiro. While calming down two customers who are debating about the broken glass, he remembers Date. While giving advice to Azusa who got hurt when she picked the broken glass, he remembers Matsuda. Later that night, he receives a message from Rum, so he decide to take a leave. When he sees his car, he remembers Hagiwara. In the end, he makes a narration about himself while driving away.\n",

Instead, it was included as Remaster episode with their own numbering system (R133). The number was not shown in official website, but through Crunchyroll simulcast, which was taken down after several days.

    "Quotes": "- Conan Edogawa:\nBoth the spring breeze and blazing afterglow of summer transform into fragments of memory in our busy lives. And when colorless winds begin to blow, one by one, the young police officers begin heading towards their own futures.  (風光る春の息吹も、燃え盛る真夏の残照も、慌ただしい日々の中、記憶の断片に変。そして、色なき風が吹きはじめるころ、若き警察官達は、１人１人、それぞれの明日へと歩き出していきます。)\n- Rei Furuya (to Miwako Sato and Yumi Miyamoto):\nAre you interested in the police? Then you should watch the ceremony. Our graduation ceremony is today. If you have the will to protect the people of this nation with pride and purpose.  (君達、警察官に興味あるのか？もしそうなら、見学していくといい。今日は僕達の卒業式なんだ。誇りと使命感を持って、この国の人達を守り抜く決意があるのなら…)\n- Police academy principal (to all graduates):\nI imagine you'll face numerous challenges going forward, but use the knowledge and skills you learned at this academy and always consider what you can do to protect the safety and security of community residents.  (君達はこれから幾多の困難に直面すると思いますが、これまでの学校生活で学んだ知識や技能を発揮し、地域住民の安全と安心を守るため、自分には何ができるかと常に考え、積極的に取り組んでほしい！)\n"
