    "Case": "",
    "Part 1": "Maika Zenda decides to kill her would be husband, Toji Fukikoshi, in front of his villa.\n\nSeveral hours later, Zenda picks up the Detective Boys, along with their teachers at the station. Using Zenda's car, they go to pick wild plants. Later, while Ayumi and Zenda are searching for Zenda's earring, Conan, Haibara, and Rumi find Fukikoshi's body under the tree just next to the rear of the car.\nYamamura arrives and investigates the scene. He finds out that when the Detective Boys took a photo immediately after arriving, there was no corpse under the tree. Yamamura's assistant then reveals that Fukikoshi is a marriage swindler wanted by the police.\nMeanwhile, Ayumi is searching for a four-leaf clover, which was found while she was searching for Zenda's earring. Ayumi plans to give the clover to Zenda as a lucky charm. Hearing that, Rumi recalls Kohji Haneda's dead body and covers her right eye.\n",
    "Part 2": "Yamamura's assistant finds the villa where the murder happened. Inside the villa, there was a woman whose hands were covered with blood. Yamamura suspects the woman to be the culprit.\nConan later finds the four-leaf clover, and realizes how the body suddenly appeared under the tree.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (stabbed)\n- 42 years old\n- IT company director\n- 38 years old\n- Former elementary school teacher\n- Toji's real identity\n- Wanted marriage swindler\n- Shigefumi's girlfriend\n- Has nyctophobia and claustrophobia\n- Gunma Prefecture Police assistant inspector\n- Gunma Prefectural Police forensics officer\n",
    "Resolution": "She said they were used for her moving in with her would be husband, but were in fact they were only used for her trick. She then took the picture with the kids and used it as proof that the body wasn't next to rear of the van. While everyone was picking wild plants, she would expect them to grow thirsty, so she purposely left the refreshments in the car. She then volunteered to head back to the car when everybody started to get thirsty.\nShe also asked Ayumi to go with her to establish her alibi. When they arrived at the car, she would pretend to have lost her earring to force the two of them to crouch and search the ground for it, and she would use that moment to move the car without even starting the engine. Previously, before leaving the car, she set the gear to neutral, so that the front wheel wouldn’t get locked in and she would be able to move the car by pushing the wheel, which is evidenced by the fact that she has more mud on the back of her sleeves than on her arms.\nThe use of Ayumi for establishing the alibi is also because she is short, and a tall person would be able to notice her meddling with the back of the wheel. After moving it, she successfully made the corpse visible to everyone. They wouldn't suspect that the car moved since she parked it next to two identical trees. Proof that the car was moved is the four-leaf clover that Ayumi was looking for and that was now missing. It was in fact under the front wheel, which shouldn't be the case, if she didn't move the car.\nAyumi however defends Maika to the point of being reduced to tears, saying there is no way she would do something like this as she is very kind. Maika seeing this apologizes for using her to create her alibi and admits her guilt, she confesses that she found out long ago that her husband was cheating on her. She brought him to the house he had been using for his affair as it would be the last thing he saw before she killed him. She then framed his lover and mistress, by leaving her restrained in the very house they used to cheat on her.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- A scene with the Detective Boys and their teachers in the train is shown at the beginning, which wasn't in the manga.\n- Kohji's palm bruise is not shown in the anime. However, the anime shows Kohji's bishop small crack mark, while in the manga it was hidden.\n",
    "Trivia": "- There are some references to the manga series Urusei Yatsura by Rumiko Takahashi.\n- Incidentally, Lum and Ataru Morobushi from the series is voiced by Fumi Hirano (Rumi Wakasa's voice actress) and Toshio Furukawa (Misao Yamamura's voice actor) respectively.\n- There is a scene when Conan is playing cards with Mitsuhiko and Genta in the train, which is a reference to The 36-Cell Perfect Game.\n- The fake names used by Uruma are Michio Kogo (古後 道生), Hajime Tadano (只野 創), Ruita Usui (薄井 塁太) and Rikuaki Segawa (瀬川 陸明).\n- The case takes place in Minakami (みなかみ), in Gunma prefecture, but the names were changed to Minanokami (みなのかみ). Similarly, Minakami Station (水上駅) becomes Minanokami Station (水乃上駅). The village is also approximately an hour away from Mount Fuyuna (冬名山), the real-life Mount Haruna (榛名山) which is the setting place of The Witch Enshrouded by Fog.\n- The van is a white Mazda Biante. The license plate is 赤城 301, す 37・26 (Akagi 301, Su 37-26).\n- The train the Detective Boys and their teachers take is on the Jōetsu Line from Takasaki to Nagaoka. It is operated in real-life by JR East, but the anime changed it to TR East.\n- The names of the suspects and Fukikoshi's aliases come from edible wild plant names in Japanese:\n- Maika Zenda (善田 舞佳) comes from the Asian royal fern (ゼンマイ, Zenmai in Japanese);\n- Toji Fukikoshi (吹越 桐司) comes from butterbur sprouts (蕗の薹, Fukinotō in Japanese);\n- Ruito Usui (薄井 塁人) comes from leaves of Siebold's plantain lily (ウルイ, Urui in Japanese);\n- Hajime Tadano (只野 創) comes from Japanese angelica tree sprouts (タラの芽, Taranome in Japanese);\n- Michio Kogo (古後 道生) comes from young shoots of the fiddlehead fern (コゴミ, Kogomi in Japanese);\n- Rikuaki Segawa (瀬川 陸明) comes from the water celery (芹, Seri in Japanese).\n- As opposed to that, Fukikoshi's real name Shigefumi Uruma (閏間 茂史) comes from the lacquer tree (漆, Urushi in Japanese), a toxic plant always mistaken for an edible wild plant.\n- The painting about flowers in the house appeared before in Karahashi Group's lobby from Conan Cornered in the Darkness and in Mori family's former apartment from Memories from Sakura Class.
