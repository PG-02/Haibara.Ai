    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan go to the old, mythical village of Izumo, Shimane Prefecture. There they meet Eiko Ezumi, an employee at the Hinode Inn owned by her parents, and learn that she is to marry a rotten businessman, Koji Wanibuchi, founder and president of his own company. Later they meet her childhood friend, Ryosuke Fukuma, and it comes to a rocky start when Kogoro confronts at him about the rotten man who tries to steal his love interest and tells him that he should do something about it. The next day, Eiko's fiancé is found dead with his Sword of the Eight-Headed Snake he was carrying goes missing.\n\nAccording to Ran, this murder reminds her of \"The Extermination of the Eight-Headed Serpent\". It's a legend about Susano's admirable act. There once was a pitiable princess who had been taken by the Eight-Headed Serpent against her will. Then the admirable Susano appeared and killed the Eight-Headed Serpent, saving the princess. This case reminded Ran of this story because he also obtained the serpent's sword. However, according to Kogoro, Susano's act may have been heroic, but their case's culprit isn't. He may have coincidentally saved Eiko from being stuck in a doomed marriage, but he's no more than a robber and a murderer. Ran already knows that much. She was just saying this is almost like the extermination of that serpent.\nThe following day, the police have four suspects, two of whom are Eiko and Fukuma, and other two are Takehiko Fujie and Kazuya Ishitobi. Eiko and Fukuma's alibis don't sit right with Conan, who takes Ran to investigate the alibis.\nConan proves that Eiko and Fukuma's alibis were to protect each other. Fukuma finds Eiko's pendant at the crime scene and thinks it was her and Eiko thought it was Fukuma from his alibi that he was where she really was, the train station, but she didn't see him. Then it turns out that Fujie went to Eiko's home to convince Wanibuchi to spare his businesses. Eiko realizes that her pendant vanished that same night. Ishitobi's alibi checks out when the police discover that he is charged with a D.U.I. (Driving Under the Influence).\nAt the Matsue Castle's entrance register, Conan notices something that helps him figure who the culprit is. Conan tricks Fujie and Kogoro, by impersonating their voices to the other, to meet in front of Hinomisaki tower where Conan tranqs Kogoro and solves the case.\n",
