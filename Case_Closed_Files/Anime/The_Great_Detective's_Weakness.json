    "Situation": "One night, Kogoro inadvertently gets mixed up in a bank heist and attempts to aid the police by chasing the robber down. Unfortunately for him, the suspect climbs up the fireladder of a building in his flight and then jumps across the gap between two rooftops to get away, losing his gun in the process. Impulsively, Kogoro tries to follow him before he is reminded of his severe acrophobia. As he teeters on the edge of the roof, shivering with dread, the culprit's pistol is collected from the alleyway below by an unknown individual.\n\nWhile the suspect is arrested later, his gun remains gone, and in addition Kogoro has suffered a major shock from his unfortunate experience, rendering him unable even to climb on top of a chair. Two days later in his office, he, Ran, and Conan watch a live TV report of one Taizo Sakaki, a suspect in a fraud case, being released on bail until his trial, when suddenly a biker drives up, draws the missing pistol, and begins firing at him! Sakaki is saved with an emergency operation, and since Kogoro recognized the gun, he decides to take up the case in order to blot out the feeling of guilt his acrophobia has brought upon him.\n\n\n",
