    "Situation": "The Detective Boys are on a camping trip but Professor Agasa forgot the tent. They then wander to a castle owned by an old mistress and learn that there's a secret treasure in the castle. Mitsuru Mamiya is actually the second husband of the eldest Mamiya daughter.\n\nThe Detective Boys, Haibara, and Agasa begin searching for Conan but have no luck. Pausing their search, the group eats dinner and discusses the chess pieces in the garden and the mystery treasure in the castle. During dinner, Mitsuru tells the group about the burnt tower and about a supposed curse that has resulted in the tower being locked.\n\n\nAfter dinner, Agasa and Haibara realize that something must have happened to Conan to prevent him from contacting anyone. Agasa is about to phone the police to investigate but upon seeing Conan's hat in the hallway, he is lured to an opening in the wall.\n\nWhen nighttime comes, Haibara investigates freely and is accompanied by the Detective Boys. They enter the same secret passage as Conan did and wander out of another secret entrance. Genta remains trapped in the passage and captured by the culprit.\n\nMitsuhiko investigates the doorway to the castle's tower and disappears. Haibara and Ayumi investigate the abandoned tower of the castle and find the culprit using a secret entrance connected to the castle.\n\n",

She also killed of the long time servants for the same reason. When Haibara and Ayumi were coming out from under a floor tile in the castle main hall, the culprit grabs on and tries to kill them.\n\nThen Conan, Mitsuhiko, Agasa and Genta appear, thanks to that Mitsuhiko used Conan's glasses that the culprit purposely dropped to find where the three are confined. Conan reveals that he know the current grand mistress is an imposter because she knew the change in passport despite supposedly not having left the Mamiya mansion in years.
