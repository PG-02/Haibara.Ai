    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Mamoru Kokubo visits the home of his aunt, Naoko Kokubo, and finds that she's been murdered. Then, a hill myna named Nine and famed for ill-speaking people flees.\n\nNaoko lived with her maid, Emi Yahagi. At the time of the crime, Emi had gone shopping and wasn't at home. It's discovered that Naoko, who gathered old books, was buying imitations from an old bookstore owner, Yotaro Sayama.\nMegure believes one of three is the criminal but they all have alibis. Conan gets close to the case's truth going by what Nine says.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (strangled)\n- 70 years old\n- Picture book author\n- Naoko's pet Myna\n- 30 years old\n- Fledgling children's book author\n- Naoko's nephew\n- 18 years old\n- Naoko's hired maid\n- 60 years old\n- Used book store owner\n- Midoridai Station Police Box officer\n- Tokyo MPD Police officer\n",
    "Resolution": "The decisive pieces of evidence for Sayama's guilt are:\n- His statement that he saw the myna trailing a red string behind him, whereas Mrs. Kokubo had attached that piece of string to Nine's leg just on this very morning, and Nine later left his leg ring and the string in Kogoro's hands when he escaped from the police box.\n- The flowerpot found near the door was carried inside by Sayama himself, after Mrs. Kokubo had ordered him to do so after opening the side entrance for him. Since Mrs. Kokubo was confined to her wheelchair, and since Mamoru und Emi were obviously surprised to see the pot at its odd location, this left Sayama as the only person who could have moved it.\n- Sayama's complaint that something stinks in the living room - a phrase Nine has picked up before the murder occured - stems from Kokubo having ordered him to stir the odorous pickles she kept in her cellar. When Sayama returned and saw her sitting with her back to the trap door, he seized her stole from behind and strangled her with only needing one healthy hand.\n",
    "Trivia": "- A slight production mistake occurs in the second part of the episode, right after Haibara and Ayumi have presented themselves as Emi Yahagi's witnesses. When Kogoro is seen chuckling at Megure's perplexity, the fluttering of Nine's wings can still be heard, but at the same time the myna's feet are already resting on the top of Kogoro's head.\n"
