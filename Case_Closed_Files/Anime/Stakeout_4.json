    "Situation": "On Beika Amusement Park's final day before indefinite closure, the Detective Boys visit it for one last time. One hour before the closure, the Detective Boys get on the Ferris Wheel and spot Takagi and Chiba in the park's security control room. After entering the room, they find Takagi and Chiba dressed as security guards and conducting a stakeout. Without any other choice, Takagi explains the case behind the reason for the stakeout.\nSix years ago, two thieves conducted a robbery on a nearby jewelry store.\n\nThe main culprit of the robbery was identified as a man named Ippei Kanieda, but he died in a traffic accident the next day.\n\nStrangely, no jewels were found in Ippei's home. The amusement park was where Ippei was working part-time as a student and is near the site of the traffic accident where he died. So, the jewels are thought to be hidden somewhere in the amusement park. The police also identified Ippei's accomplice as \"Ebishima\" (an alias), whom Ippei met over a criminal website. \"Ebishima\" was likely waiting for the statute of limitations to expire before they would come retrieve the jewels. However, since the park had announced its closure, they would have to collect the jewels before the amusement park was demolished. Up until the final day before closure, the police have found no movement in the stolen goods market, so it is almost certain that \"Ebishima\" would have to show up on this final day.\nConan deduces that the jewels would have to be hidden in concealed places, which eliminates all places in the park except for the employee-only areas. Not long afterward, a retired, now volunteer security guard named Hisao Yamagata enters one of the areas. Because he is a security guard, he is not suspected by Takagi, who is monitoring from the security room. However, in a panoramic video that Haibara takes of the employee-only area, Conan notices a suspicious-looking vent where the vent itself is rusted, but the bolts holding the vent are not. At the same time, a woman named Kanako Sakuramachi lost her 5-year-old daughter, Hiroko, and a mysterious Baker Eats delivery man named Daiki Nagasaki appears. A single shoe of Kanako's daughter is found in front of one of the employee-only areas. Meanwhile, since Daiki was instructed to deliver some hamburgers to the employee-only area next to the spinning cups, he enters the second employee-only area. Kanako, wanting to find her child as soon as possible, enters a third employee-only area, and so, three different people have entered each of the employee-only areas, making all of them suspects.\nTo add to the chaos, \"Ebishima\" suddenly calls the security room to announce that they have planted bombs in the amusement park. Right after, multiple smoke bombs were detonated, though they did not cause any casualties.\n\nAfter the string of smoke bomb explosions, Daiki is suddenly instructed to deliver the hamburgers to Beika Station instead, and the second shoe of the lost girl is found near the Ferris wheel, next to a drinking fountain. At the drinking fountain, Mitsuhiko finds that the back panel of the fountain was removed, while Conan discovers some small prints in the flowerbed behind the fountain. Also, Genta finds Hisao collapsed in one of the employee-only areas. Hisao is seen trying to open the suspicious-looking vent that Conan spotted earlier. But Conan has already solved the case.\n",
    "People": "- Deceased (traffic accident)\n- Main culprit of 500 million yen robbery\n- Ippei's accomplice\n- Wanted jewel robber from 500 million yen robbery\n- 75 years old\n- Retired\n- Beika Amusement Park former security guard\n- 35 years old\n- 5 years old\n- Kanako's daughter\n- 30 years old\n- Baker Eats deliveryman\n- 29 years old (6 years ago)\n- Ippei's wife\n",
    "Resolution": "It is concluded that there was no lost daughter in the first place; that was simply a lie Kanako had fabricated to reduce security. By doing so, Kanako could more easily retrieve the jewels hidden behind the drinking fountain near the Ferris wheel. Conan deduced this from the high heel prints on the flowerbed behind the fountain and finally deduces that Kanako is \"Ebishima.\" Chiba, who reveals himself as a police officer, asks to inspect Kanako's bag, but Kanako confidently replies that she has no jewels on her. Takagi shows up immediately with Daiki's delivery bag on his back. He opens the bag to reveal a smaller bag which contains jewels.\nConan continues his deduction by saying that Kanako detonated the smoke bombs all over the amusement park to evacuate everyone from the park and used that opportunity to sneak the bag of jewels into the Daiki's delivery bag. This was the reason why Daiki was instructed to deliver food to the employee-only area, a set, discrete location. After the jewels were put into the delivery bag, Kanako, as the person who ordered the food, instructs Daiki to deliver the \"food\" to Beika Station where the jewels were supposed to be retrieved.\nTo conclude the deduction, Conan says that while the police assumed \"Ebishima\" was a man, the real \"Ebishima\" was actually Ippei's wife, Megumi Kanieda. By extension, Megumi is also the real identity behind \"Kanako Sakuramachi.\" Conan further adds that it is also possible that Megumi was the one who ran over Ippei six years ago. Megumi confesses this fact.\nRegarding the former security guard Hisao, the reason why he was opening the vent in the employee-only area was because he was hiding some of the park's merchandise there. They were meant to be gifts for his grandchild, but taking them without permission would be considered theft. However, the park decides to let Hisao take the merchandise without taking legal action on him.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This episode features the second appearance of the Baker Eats delivery bag, which is a parody of Uber Eats. The term \"Baker\" is derived from Baker Street, the fictional street where Sherlock Holmes lives. The first appearance of this delivery bag was in Girls Day Mystery 3.\nThis is also the first appearance of an actual Baker Eats deliveryman on the job.\n- This is also the first appearance of an actual Baker Eats deliveryman on the job.\n- Continuity error: Kazunobu Chiba's Police ID was misanimated with his name written Isshin Chiba (千葉 一伸), the name of his voice actor, instead of the actual name in anime[N 1].\n- This is also the first appearance of an actual Baker Eats deliveryman on the job.\n",
