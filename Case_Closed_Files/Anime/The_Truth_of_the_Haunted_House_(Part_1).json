    "Situation": "Ran catches a cold and visits the doctor. When there one of the doctor's patients mentions that his apartment is haunted by a girl who was burned to death four years ago.\n\nConan and Kogoro decide to investigate. Once there they meet three other people who are living in that apartment. Ran who is fearful of ghost tells her father they should leave at 7 pm. When the clock strikes 10:20 pm, Ran wakes up to find a ghost in the television telling her to leave. Kogoro and Conan wake up due to her screaming. Kogoro tells Ran it was probably a dream and goes to the toilet. After he's done the water turns red. Kogoro backs away from the toilet and screams when he sees a ghostly image.\n\nThe three people excluding the old man are given more back story. One man does not believe in the ghost, one man is a horror movie filmer, and the other man just lives there but believes in ghost. They are told that two suspects of the burning four years ago ran from the scene and one of them was identified. Conan finds out how the ghost trick was done.\n",
    "People": "- 68 years old\n- Room resident 5\n- Tomoaki Araide's patient\n- 34 years old\n- Room resident 4\n- Horror shorts filmer\n- 22 years old\n- Room resident 2\n- Believes in ghosts\n- 27 years old\n- Room resident 1\n- Student\n- Doesn't believe in ghosts\n- Deceased (burned)\n- Murdered in the park two years ago\n\n",
    "Resolution": "\n- Rui Tabuchi's murderer from four years ago\n- Banchou's accomplice\nBanchou then attempts to escape and tries to scare Ran who is on his way. Ran however, who is not scared at all, quickly incapacitates him. Both Banchou and the other suspect is later arrested. The motive was the woman who is burned into death has bankrupted despite she has a huge debt to Banchou and the other suspect.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga version, this case takes place right after Shinichi Kudo's New York Case, which actually aired later in the anime series. At the beginning, Conan is shown disguising his voice as Shinichi's and asking Ran about her sickness over the phone. He also tells her that the serial killer they encountered in New York was actually murdered, because it would be unusual for someone to erase his fingerprints and blood trails if he decided to commit suicide. In the anime version, this scene didn't happen until the end of episode 288, and in this case it was replaced with Sonoko talking to Ran in her bedroom instead.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The dead girl on TV watching Ran is an allusion to Sadako Yamamura in the Japanese horror film Ringu.\n- The names of the guest characters are derived from Japan's four most famous ghost stories: Yotsuya Kaidan, Botan Dourou, the Banchou Sarayashiki (the ghost from which is named \"Kiku\" or \"Okiku\"), and Miminashi Houichi or \"Houichi the Earless\". \"Otonashi\" is a double pun, as it means \"without sound\", which relates to the subject matter of the original tale.\n",
