    "Situation": "After an unlucky morning at the pachinko salon, Kogoro who walks about sees Conan at a small police office near a train station. He walks in angrily only to find out that Conan was there only to return a found wallet. As they are about to leave the well-known comedian Rokusuke Dodonpa (real name: Rokusuke Tanigaki) walks in and announces to have murdered his chief.\n\nWith Kogoro, Conan, Megure, and Takagi at the crime scene, Chiba brings the housekeeper Ueki to the scene. The victim is Hideki Tendou, Dodonpa's manager and president of the production office. The comedian who turned himself in explains to the police that he has entered the office at 11:10 AM, showed off some of his work to his boss to which he replied that it is cheap, to which Dodonpa threatened the president that he would find another agency. This exchange enraged him and he struck Tendou with a bat which was in the room. Journalists try to force their way into the room to gather statements, but they are hastily dismissed by the police. It appears to be a straightforward case, with the murderer coming forth and admitting his crime, but Conan makes a couple remarks regarding the simplicity of the case and the fact that there appears to be no real motive present. Rokusuke tells the police that he had arrived by train at 11AM, came to the house 10 minutes later and by 11:30 AM he had already turned himself in, which Conan and the train's cameras can attest to, the reason for it outrage was the fact that his manager never signed him up to appear in a variety show on television, even after he asked him for it. The bat was sent to forensics and they confirm that it contains traces of blood and hair from Tendou's body.\nConan wanders around the building searching for clues, meeting the housekeeper who shows Conan that the garden door was left open and that an iron bar was left in the garden, which most likely belonged to a nearby construction site. While Conan takes a look at the bar, he sees Takagi pacing towards the building, who reports that the forensics' conclusion is that the bat, which Dodonpa claimed to have used is, in fact, not the murder weapon as it doesn't fit Tendou's cephalic trauma, which must have been inflicted by a cylindrical-shaped object. After further inquiries about how the bat got tainted with blood and hair, Dodonpa still claims to be the culprit. Conan takes a stroll through the building and asks the housekeeper about other guests who have visited the house today. He tells him that not many have as most of them as on vacation, and before Dodonpa's visit, Tendou left the building to buy lunch. The police's investigation yields results as a nearby convenience store proves that he had bought lunch shortly before 8 AM. Megure questions Dodonpa's whereabouts at 9 AM, to which he states to have visited his former teacher, Izumi Suda, now a painter, who lives an hour's drive away. Chiba and Takagi visit her and confirm that he had indeed visited her. He made a quasi-appointment with her and visited at 9 AM sharp (as seen by her analogue clock that hangs next to the door) to return a book he had borrow earlier. Medical forensics have found out that the tempus mortis is 1 hour after he had eaten the purchased food, circa 9 AM which excludes Dodonpa from suspicions. After he is confronted with the evidence, he admits to not being the murderer but also to not know the real culprit. He explains that his real motive was to protect Tendou's honor. He claims that even though Tendou was a shady person, who abused his position and extorted people, he really gave his best for his career and pushed him forward. By admitting guilt for the murder, which he did not do, he would keep Tendou's slate clean. After he found the body, he took the blame and hit him to make it appear real, without thinking of consequences. Even though he's not the culprit, he will still face charges for meddling with the crime scene. With the main suspect now unknown, the investigation is back to step one, as Megure orders Chiba and Takagi to find the people whom he extorted.\nIn front of the building, journalists try to get a statement from the comedian, who explains the situation and apologizes profoundly. Conan asks a journalist how he found out about the case, since nobody from the outside could've leaked information regarding it, to which he responds that he had received and anonymous tip. Conan worries if there is more to it and if perhaps Dodonpa had tricked them into believing he's innocent.\nRan went to a karate tournament, so Conan and Kogoro eat breakfast without her. Rokusuke's apology is publicly broadcasted via television, and when Conan's mentioning about how much of a good person he must be, to take the blame in order to protect his boss' honor, Kogoro says that he'll probably be swarmed with contracts from new agents, making the whole situation look even more fishy.\nConan arrives at the crime scene with his Skateboard where he meets Takagi. He questions him in \"Kogoro's stead\". He tells him that the culprit has used the backyard's stairs and that the metal rod comes from a construction site in Beika. Chiba enters the scene and reports that no matter whom he asked, everyone spoke highly of the victim and that he had a good reputation. Megure calls Takagi and tells him that the culprit has called the police station from a public phone booth, and told them that he had information regarding Hideki. In a flashback it is shown that the caller used some kind of voice-alteration to make it appear higher than normal, to which the police concludes that it was a woman who called, stating that she knows the culprit but that they will never catch him. Dodonpa returns to the crime scene, having overheard the talk between the three of them, he asks whether they are certain that it is a woman, but Conan tells him that Mouri knows who the culprit is and that he will be able to prove it in the near future. As Rokusuke's about to pull out his cigarettes, the drops a packet of tissues from a pachinko hall, which startles him. Conan again pretends to question in Kogoro's stead when he asks the cashier in the nearby convenience store if Hideki has said anything, to which he tells him that, since Hideki always arrives at the same time, he has prepared his meal for him, to which he replied that he usually eats his meal while watching a morning show at 8 AM where the hostess is very cute.\nConan tries his luck with the artist, Izumi, but to no avail since she doesn't know of the great detective. Having failed this way, he uses his voice altering bowtie and calls Kogoro pretending to be Megure. With the purple-suit detective by his side, they begin questioning Izumi about her routine. She tells them that she has neither television, radio or a mobile phone and that the only way to tell the time is the clock on her wall. She also mentions that at that time she usually paints which makes her sleepy afterwards. She confirms, to Kogoro's question, that Dodonpa was there yesterday at the given time, after he made and appointment the evening before by telephone. She also mentions that she was more than usually sleepy yesterday when the policemen arrived, thinking it might have something to do with the cake Rokusuke has brought. Conan's last question is answered negatively, regarding whether she looks her door at night, stating that she doesn't have to since the area is pretty safe. As they are leaving the area, they are approached by a man who offers them tissues from a pachinko hall, stating that the entrance is free. Conan asks him if the gave out the same tissues yesterday, to which he replies that he did at around 10 AM. Conan additionally asks if he had given them to anyone famous from television yesterday, which surprises the young man.\nWith Rokusuke being summoned to the scene and Megure, Chiba, and Takagi already waiting, as they enter the apartment Kogoro's (Conan's) reasoning begins.\n",
    "People": "- 30 years old\n- Comedian\n- Victim (bludgeoned)\n- 42 years old\n- Production office president\n- 68 years old\n- Painter\n- Housekeeper\n- Man handing out tissues\n- Tokyo MPD police officer in Beika Station police box\n- Convenience store owner\n- Hideki's friend\n- Reporter\n",
    "Resolution": "Evidence which supports Conan's theory is the pachinko hall promoter who recognized Dodonpa as he offered him tissues. He asked him for an autograph and as their exchange became physical, Rokusuke dropped the art books which he returned to the artist, which the promoter recalls. Kogoro says that it will become clear once they check the fingerprints on the books, not of the culprit, but those of the promoter, that he indeed was there at the given time. After he had perfected his alibi, he returned to the crime scene and struck the president with the bat, then turned himself in.\nAfter he had carried out the deed, the gave the tip to the media about the crime and by fake admitting the crime he had given himself a strong base to stand on for future work once his alibi would be confirmed.\nThe mentally ill driven Dodonpa, who admits the crime, claiming that the victim was a bad person and that by committing murder he had hit two birds with one stone, sees nothing bad in what he had which aggravates the policemen. Megure snaps and starts yelling at him, demanding to know if he doesn't understand that he had erased a human life. After the short exchange, he breaks down crying, saying that he knows what he did and that he regrets what he has done.\n",
