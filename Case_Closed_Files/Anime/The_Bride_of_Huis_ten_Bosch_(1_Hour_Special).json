    "Situation": "Sonoko invites Ran and Conan to attend a wedding between Shinya Ooga and Akane Katori at the Huis Ten Bosch, Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture. On the way there, the three meet a glass artisan named Junichi Takahashi who accompanies them to the Huis Ten Bosch to the glass museum. Shinya's grandmother, Tae Ooga, impressed by Takahashi's knowledge on glass invites him to dinner with the Ooga family. That night, Shinya's parents offer Akane a heirloom wedding room for the wedding and invite Takahashi to attend the wedding. Before the wedding begins, the ring is found missing and in its place is a picture of Akane with Hydrangea Otakusas in the background.\n\nConan realizes that the flower refers to Philipp Franz von Siebold's Japanese wife, Taki (滝, lit. \"Waterfall\"), and finds the ring on a flowing fountain depicting the ending to Greek mythology Cupid and Psyche. Conan soon learns that Akane has been kidnapped and finds her in a carillon in the amusement park.\n\n\n\n",
