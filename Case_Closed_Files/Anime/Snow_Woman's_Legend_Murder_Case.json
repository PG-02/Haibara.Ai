    "Situation": "A famous movie Yuki-onna star and her body double show up at the same cabin Kogoro and family are spending vacation time at Miyagi Prefecture, but when a note and a mysterious illness seem to overcome the star, then Kogoro decides to begin searching it as a case. Is there something more than a mysterious suicide note though that could indicate murder?\n\n",

    "Resolution": "Yoko first forged a letter in which Akiko said she was ill and wanted to commit suicide, then booked a room in the inn (which she knew about since she worked there part-time long ago) and arranged so they'd spend the night there.\nThe following day, Yoko drugged Akiko and knocked her out when they were out skiing. She later took off her ski outfit and put a white kimono on her, burying Akiko in the snow, which would cause her a deathly hypothermia. Yoko then put Akiko's snow clothes, which included a full-face mask. This let her return to the inn unnoticed, and since then on she used her knowledge of the place to play the role of both women, tricking everyone into believing that Akiko was in their bedroom due to her \"illness\", as her father's death after a long cancer.\n",
