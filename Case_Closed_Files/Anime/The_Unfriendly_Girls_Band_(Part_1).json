    "Situation": "After watching a Girls Band movie, Sonoko goes to the Poirot Cafe to try to convince Ran and Masumi to create a band with her. With Sonoko on drums, Ran on keyboard, Masumi on bass and Azusa on guitar, she expects them to be able to perform at the Beika festival at the end of the year. However when asked to perform by several men in the cafe, she fails miserably, only to be saved by Rei who plays really well. Rei is then invited to join in place of Azusa and they all head to a sound studio to record. Throughout several conversations, Masumi mentions that she was taught how to play the bass by a friend of her oldest brother. Rei accidentally let slip that he knew that the friend was a guy, despite the fact that he and Masumi were not supposed to have met until today.\nTheir conversation is interrupted by a group of people sitting close by. Someka Kibune was yelling at her fellow band mates about them being out of practice despite them having a show coming up in a week, which is a memorial show in honor of Akane Shuto. Hagie Yamaji decides to go into the studio room to nap for 10 minutes as a break before they continue to practice. During this time, Rei asks who do the vocals and they come to the conclusion that none of them can sing. Masumi asks if Ran could call Shinichi because \"he can play the guitar as well, right?\", but Ran points out that he is tone deaf but can play the violin. Its then that they hear a scream and run down to find Hagie sitting at her drum set, dead from strangulation, surrounded by her band mates. They go to the security office to watch the camera footage and discover that the screen was blocked out by another member's cellphone on a selfie stick.\nThe police arrive and Megure inquires who set up the selfie stick. Tadako Fuekawa had set up the stick, but only on instructions from the others. The set up was taking too long so Hagie had ordered them to leave it where it was. Takagi points out that one side of the room is mirrored and that the curtain over it was pulled. However the band mates point out that the curtain was also Hagie's doing. They decide to review the security tapes again while getting the alibis of the suspects. All three suspects had entered the room. Tadako was first, she entered the room to get her sewing kit to fix Someka's jacket. To do so, she sat on a stool right at the edge where the cellphone covered the footage. She tried to wake Hagie by calling out to her, but she got no response. Next was Someka, who was trying to restring her guitar. She then walked off camera to tune her guitar next to the Hagie in order to wake her up to resume practice, but was unsuccessful. The final person to enter the room was Rumi, She moved the keyboards away from where Hagie was sleeping and played the keyboards to change the notes. Even though she sang, Hagie never woke up. All three of the suspects were searched and the weapon is no where to be found.\n\nMasumi sees a guitar case and a memory is sparked. She remembers seeing her brother, Shuichi Akai, on a train platform 4 years ago with a friend. They were both carrying guitar cases. She had followed them until Shuichi noticed. He then left to buy her a ticket and send her home. During that time, the friend pulled out his guitar and taught Masumi a few notes. She notes that even though he was carrying a soft case, it remained standing after the guitar was removed. Conan thinks to himself that it may have had a sniper rifle inside. A third person had walked up to them with a hat down over his face and refereed to the friend as \"Scotch\". When Masumi says that Rei looks like the person who was wearing the hat, he dodges the question.\nThe three suspects point out that they had altercations with members of other bands, and that it is possible that one of them may have been the killer.\nConan asks to see the video recorded by the cellphone from before the murder. It had been filming vertically because it was stylish and so it would not show their legs. Rei and Masumi lean in to get a better look, and they realize how the trick was done.\n",

    "Resolution": "The motive was that the victim had been telling Akane to drink lots of wine and scream into a pillow to get her voice back, but in actuality it was making her voice worse. Then she told Akane that her voice was withering and that she shouldn't even show up to the next gig. Later Akane committed suicide by jumping in front of a car. However it seems that was all a misconception. Akane had run out into the road to save a small child who was crossing the road to get his ball. The victim had believed that she was responsible for Akane's death, not because of her harsh words about her voice, but because she had made a deal with her not to speak until her voice had gotten better. This was why Akane ran into the road rather then shouting, because it would hurt her voice.\n\nAfter the case, Masumi revealed to Ran and Sonoko that the reason she became a detective was because of her oldest brother Shuichi, who is an FBI agent. Sonoko inquires if the person who taught Masumi the base was also from the FBI, but Masumi denies it. Amuro inwardly comments that the man was a member of the Metro Police Department Public Security Bureau and that Shuichi was the one who killed him.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- The anime skips a few lines of dialogue about Akane's death seen in the panel to the right and jumps to Inspector Megure saying they need to examine the CCTV footage.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The Girls Band Movie that Sonoko refers to at the beginning of episode 836 seems to be a reference to the anime \"K-On!\"\n- She references that the drummer of the band looks like her (Ritsu Tainaka), the basist had long black hair like Ran (Mio Akiyama), and there was a guitarist named \"Azusa\" (Azusa Nakano).\n- The names of the suspects come from musical instrument makers[2]:\n- Someka Kibune (木船 染花, キブネ ソメカ in katakana) comes from Gibson (guitars) (ギブソン, Gibuson);\n- Tadako Fuekawa (笛川 唯子, フエカワ タダコ in katakana) comes from Fender (guitars) (フェンダー, Fendā);\n- Rumi Kogure (小暮 留海) comes from Korg (keyboards) (コルグ, Korugu);\n- Hagie Yamaji (山路 萩江) comes from Yamaha (keyboards, among others) (ヤマハ);\n- Akane Shutō (首頭 朱音) comes from Shure (microphones) (シュア, Shua).\n",
