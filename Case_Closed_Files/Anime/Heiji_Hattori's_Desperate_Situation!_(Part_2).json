    "Situation": "Heiji, Kazuha, and a man named Kusukawa are held hostage in an attic of someone's home.\n\nMeanwhile, Conan, Ran, and Kogoro are tired of waiting for the two and begin searching for them based on clues from the last phone call. They investigate Detective Kusukawa's home and discover evidence that Heiji had been there. Conan finds a memo which discloses Kenbashi City, Ito Residence. They investigate those with the surname Ito but are unable to find information about Heiji. Meanwhile, it is revealed Heiji is held hostage by Misari Ito, an attorney who is the head of a tax evasion group. Ito demands Heiji to solve a code made by Kusukawa which contains a seven-digit-code to a safe box containing evidence of her scandal.\nWhile held at gunpoint, Heiji sends a modified version of the code to Kogoro and asks him to solve it. Conan manages to solve the code, realizing that K, Q, and J stand for King, Queen, and Jack and replaces them with numbers accordingly. When Heiji receives the code back from Kogoro, he tells Misari he will tell her the seven digits and they head to the bank.\n",
