Funako Nakai then came to Kazuma's house to find him and Conan followed her. Conan asked Kazuma's neighbor, Takashi Kiyose if he noticed something strange about Kazuma and at the same time, another neighbor named Akio Nashida suddenly burst out after hearing noise and claimed that he didn't know. When Conan got back to the house, he felt that someone is watching them and asked Funako if the notebook was the reason why she couldn't go to the police. Funako then gave the notebook to  Conan and he immediately read what was inside the notebook. It was titled \"Crime Plan\", containing an article about how to rob a particular place.\n\nLater, Ishigama Jewelry is robbed.
