    "Situation": "As Conan and Ran are waiting for a meeting with Eri, they meet Masumi, who is investigating Rumi Kitao's boyfriend, Kenya Settsu, about adultery. Thinking that Kenya will make a move upon seeing Ran, Masumi has Conan and Ran approach the couple upon the pretense of needing a meal. However, Kenya doesn't seem to be interested in Ran and asks Ran to accompany Rumi to wake Waka, Kenya's ex-girlfriend. Rumi and Ran has to open Waka's apartment with a key when no one answers.\n\n",
    "People": "- 17 years old\n- Teitan High School Class A student\n- Rumi's younger sister\n- 21 years old\n- University student\n- 22 years old\n- University student\n- Rumi's boyfriend\n- Victim (bludgeoned)\n- University student\n- Kenya's former girlfriend\n- 22 years old\n- University student\n- Kenya and Waka's friend\n",
    "Resolution": "As for the motive, Kenya had dumped Waka because he was starting to date a rich girl, and Waka threatened Kenya to reveal all his former deeds to this girl. Additionally, Kenya intended to pin the murder on Rumi for the same reason as he never really liked her and only dated her for such purpose. Inspector Jugo, having enough of Kenya's callous attitude, proceeds to punch his face and orders his men to take him into the custody while Mitsuaki conforts the tearful Rumi.\n",
