    "Situation": "Conan is talking to Haibara about the situation of last episode. Conan gives his replica phone to Haibara and tells her to thank Professor Agasa for it. Haibara says that Conan wouldn't have fooled Ran if she didn't send lots of messages that belongs to him.\nConan and the Detective Boys meet Takagi in a jewelry store, and soon after, they witness the store being robbed. They chase him to a nearby roof, which he jumps off of, killing himself.\n\n\nConan notices several suspicious things about the incident, leading the police to believe that it wasn't as simple of a case as it first appeared to be, including the fact that the van he fell onto was being used by the culprit's former boss. At the end, Conan realizes that it was a murder, and who did it.\n",
    "People": "- 51 years old\n- Import-Export company owner\n- Victim (fell)\n- Nekota's former employee\n- Robber\n- Lives on 6th Floor\n- Witness\n- Lives on 6th Floor\n- Mrs. Isaka's husband\n- Restaurant chef\n- Atomura's friend\n- Saw Atomura's body from her window\n- Victim (robbed)\n- Takanasi Jewelry store employee\n- Negishi Moving Company owner\n- Negishi Moving Company worker\n- Negishi Moving Company worker\n- Negishi Moving Company worker\n- Negishi Moving Company worker\n- Victim (robbed)\n- Takanasi jewelry store employee\n- Kuwata's co-worker\n- Woman A's daughter\n- Saw Atomura's body from her window\n",
    "Resolution": "- First, Nekota called the moving workers to the 9th floor of his old office and pushed Atomura to his doom. After he had confirmed that the body landed on the truck, he set up the rope used for the escape and had the workers continue the moving.\n- Next, he went to rob the jewelry store in disguise, and lured Takagi to the top of the building across the old office. After tying the rope around his waist, he fired the gun to distract Takagi while utilizing the same moment to swing across to his room which he had placed mattresses on the balcony in advance as cushoner. Because Nekota was a former Triathlonist, he had no problem in performing the stated stunts. Additionally, he also threw the bag containing robbed jewelries and spare helmet down on the truck to make the people in the area think that Atomura, who had robbed the jewelry store, fell to his doom due to being chased by the police.\n- Because he had to join up with those that discover Atomura's body as fast as possible, he is unable to dispose of the disguises, rope, or the broach that he had kept in the coat's pocket during the robbery.\nNekota's company is on its last leg, forcing him to retire employees with decrease in performance with Atomura being among them. Atomura however, threatened to expose about the corruption that had happened in the company, unless Nekota backdown and let him continue until retirement as he wanted to buy a broach his wife wants, but also added that he might requires additional \"monetary help\" from Nekota post-retirement. Not willing to be blackmailed, Nekota decided to silence Atomura. However, Nekota also feels guity about murdering Atomura, as he had gone through hardship and worked alongside him since the day they founded the company, and decides to keep the broach until the situation die down and gives it to Atomura's wife as the \"present from her late husband\".\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is the fourth hidden case in Metropolitan Police Detective Love Story (series). The third hidden case was The Trembling Police Headquarters: 12 Million Hostages.\n- When Takagi is referring to having to pay off the loan on the ring that he bought before, he is referring to Metropolitan Police Detective Love Story 5, when the engagement ring fell into the ocean, before Sato revealed that she still has feelings for Jinpei Matsuda, by freezing up when she saw the Ferris Wheel.\n- The splash title uses diamonds instead of its usual font.\n- Negishi Moving Company reappears at the ending of Home of Beika's Grenier and A Mysterious Man - Overly Strict with Regulations.\n",
