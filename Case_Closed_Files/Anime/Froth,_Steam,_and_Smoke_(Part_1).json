    "Situation": "All the people witnessed the publishing company president named Daisaku Katsumoto fall to his death.\n\nConan and the police deduced the culprit must be a person inside the building, who assaulted the president and rushed to the first floor. The required amount of time should be at least 10 minutes. The three suspects all had good alibis since the cameraman named Keisuke Ogino was drinking beer with froth bubbling on the surface, the magazine editor named Kaori Tsukihara was having coffee which still had steams, and the writer named Kazutomo Sodesaki was smoking a cigarette with smoke still coming out. Takagi performed repeated experiments to show that the threshold limit for froth, steam or smoke to stop coming out was 7 to 8 minutes. Or was there something else going on?\nThrough investigation, all of them confessed they held grudges with the murdered. Katsumoto had used their names to publish a fake article claiming that a popular actress was having an affair while engaged with a man. The \"man in the affair\" was actually her half-brother which the actress had to keep secret, because he was born from an affair her father had. Pressure and the cancellation of the marriage drove her to commit suicide. The half-brother was attacked by her fans and is still in a coma. They had prepared to take legal action against Katsumoto for the article.\n\n\n",
