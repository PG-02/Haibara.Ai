    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "In a bar called \"Marin Coffee\", Sonoko tells Ran to be able to get two tickets for a concert. At the same moment, a girl becomes aware due to not having with her tickets for the same event and charges Sonoko of theft. The next day, the girl comes back in the room stating that her tickets were put on sale in internet and the nickname of the seller led her to think that tickets have been stolen by one of the waiters.\n\n",
    "People": "- 20 years old\n- Marin Coffee shop part-time worker\n- College student\n- 26 years old\n- Marin Coffee shop manager\n- 23 years old\n- Office worker\n- Victim (bashed)\n- 20 years old\n- Marin Coffee shop part-time worker\n- College student\n- 30 years old\n- Masako's neighbor\n- 50 years old\n- Apartment landlady\n- Haruka's friend\n- Office worker\n- Birth date: December 14th\n- Guitarist\n",
    "Resolution": "After stealing it, Kosuda hid the ticket in the pocket of her cafe apron. However, after her shift at the cafe had ended, Masako Mooka mistakenly took Kosuda's apron with her for washing, thinking it was hers. When Kosuda noticed the loss and deduced that Mooka had it, she followed her home, waiting for her to leave so she could retrieve the ticket from her apron, which was already in the washing machine. However, Mooka returned unexpectedly early and caught her in the act. She had found the ticket before she put the apron in the machine, and was about to sell it on the Internet. As the two argued, Kosuda pushed Mooka too hard, which resulted in the latter receiving her fatal head injury.\nKosuda attempted to make the accident look like the work of a burglar, and in order to facilitate the ruse, she replaced her own apron with Mooka's. However, Mooka had overlooked a red ball pen (used in the cafe for writing down customer orders) in the pocket of Kosuda's apron, and as the apron was being washed, the pen's ink was diluted and spilled out, staining Mooka's other laundry pieces in the machine. While the cafe's aprons are uniformly black, the apron's white care label was stained pink by the ink, thus proving Kosuda's guilt.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Other workers at Marin Coffee include: Shinji Mizuta (水田 伸司), Reiko Natsu (奈津 羚子), Riyo Fukai (深井 莉代), and Shu Makiware (牧吾 秀).\n- In Galician Dub, Haruka Kona's family name was changed to Kondo, due to cona meaning vulva in Galician language.\n"
