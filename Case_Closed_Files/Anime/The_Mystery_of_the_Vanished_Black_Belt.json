    "Case": "The Detective Boys, supervised by Kogoro, Ran, and Sonoko, have come to Osaka to make a tour of the USJ theme park. But as luck would have it, Sonoko has learned that Makoto happens to be in Osaka, too, and unwilling to go alone, but also unwilling to leave the kids without sensible supervision by taking Ran along - she decided to pay him an impromptu visit with Conan for company. As a result, Conan and Sonoko find themselves as guest in the karate dojo of Tatsuhito Takami, a renowned martial artist and an old acquaintance of Makoto, from whom the latter had picked up his stoic demeanor and occasional intimidating presence.\n",
