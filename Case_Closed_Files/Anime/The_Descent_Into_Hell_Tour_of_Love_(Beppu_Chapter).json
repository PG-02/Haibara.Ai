    "Situation": "A man named Hidetora Nakadai and his secretary Yozo Hozogai goes into Mouri Detective Agency, to save his daughter named Manami Nakadai, at first they threatened the Nakadai family that she was kidnapped. Also, without noticing Conan.\nRan and Conan have been invited by Kogoro to the jigoku (\"hell\") hot springs near the city of Beppu in the Oita Prefecuture. However, during the train ride Conan notices that Kogoro is unusually serious, and he also spots Takagi onboard, who desperately pleads with him not to reveal his presence.\nWhile taking a tour at the springs, Conan notices a strange man wearing shades and carrying an oni mask strapped to his backpack. Right afterwards, he and Ran surprise Kogoro when he walks by holding the picture of a pretty young woman in his hands. As Kogoro reveals under pressure, he has travelled to Beppu on an assignment. The woman is Manami Nakadai, daughter of Hidetora Nakadai, the president of a prestigious electrics company. Manami has run away, leaving only a picture of her holding a ticket to the jigoku springs. The reason is that she recently became engaged with Kenichiro Ehara, a move which apparently drove her ex-boyfriend, Hiroyuki Hayami, a paper craftsman located in Beppu, into blackmailing her with pictures of their dissolved relationship.\nWhile inspecting the picture, Conan notices a van with a special logo in its background, which leads them to an inn with an outdoor hot spring for bathing. However, while discussing the case during their bath, they unknowingly catch the attention of Manami, who is also staying at the inn. Shortly afterwards, Conan and Kogoro encounter Manami, but before they can react on their discovery, a scream from Manami sends them rushing to her room, where they see what appears to be a pair of glowing red eyes hovering before the window; just moments later, the eyes suddenly float away into the darkness. When Conan investigates the scene in the light of the next morning, he notices a peculiar set of cut marks on the tree in front of the window.\nManami declares her willingness to accompany Conan and the Mouris back to Tokyo the following day, whereupon Hidetora Nakadai declares that he will come to Beppu personally to fetch her. However, when left alone in her room while Conan and the Mouris receive Hidetora, Hozogai and Ehara, Manami is kidnapped from her room by an individual wearing a red oni mask. When the others come up to look after her, they find the room ransacked and some tire tracks near the inn's emergency exit. Right afterwards, the kidnapper calls President Nakadai and demands a ransom of 100 million yen for Manami's release, to be delivered by Ehara to the Takasakiyama Zoo. Conan, suspecting that there may be more to the case than meets the eye, marks the money bundles with a highlighter pen.\nAt the same time, in nearby Yufuin, Detective Takagi is ostensibly taking a vacation with Sato, despite him having been assigned to handle an armed robbery case, with one of the perpetrators being the man with the oni mask Conan encountered in Beppu. Because Takagi is still holding his hopes high that his relationship should progress into marriage soon, he has taken a sick leave, actually an absence without justified leave, in order to spend some private time with her in Yufuin and capitalize on the emotion of the moment. However, a call from Megure not only reveals his duplicity to a furious Sato, it also points out that the car of the robbers was found at Oita Marine Palace Aquarium by the Prefecture police. Sato immediately takes up the case, towing a devastated Takagi along for some atonement, suspecting that the culrpit must be visiting the aquarium park, which incidentally lies right next to the Takasamiyama Zoo. While invesitating the zoo for clues, Takagi inadvertently crosses paths with Conan's entourage on their own stakeout of the ransom delivery.\nEhara is supposed to wait inside a visitor's cabin on the zoo grounds, but soon he comes running out with the ransom money bag in his hands, claiming that he can't handle the pressure. Then the kidnapper calls, leaving instructions to deposit the bag at the Monkey Rock, a local landmark. Expecting the kidnapper to arrive on foot, the group is taken by surprise when a remote-controlled drone arrives instead to snag the bag with a hook. Conan tries to stop it, only to be hoisted into the air along with the bag.\n\n\n",

    "Resolution": "It turns that he was an accomplice, but he didn't kidnapped Manami, but in order to split the stolen money. In his deduction, there was one more accomplice, and it was Yozo Hozogai, the second accomplice, his order was to get the stolen money, and the real culprit would have the half of it. It turns that the real culprit was Kenichiro Ehara. Ehara called the company and threatened him that his daughter is kidnapped. Ehara hid the money in the visitor's cabin and changed the money into books. The evidence is there are marks on his hand which is the highlighter that Conan draw, so that the culprit would have touched it and leave evidence. His motive is his company was going bankrupt. If he marry Manami, he could have all the money. The robbery before was staged by Ehara, but the door was locked so he didn't got the stolen money. Now, Ehara and Hosogai are arrested. Moreover, with the president's approval, Hiroyuki and Manami can return a couple.\n- 45 years old\n- Robber\n- Nakadai Electric's former employee\n",
