    "Situation": "\nThe police (Megure, Sato, and some others), dressed in Cheetah Delivery uniforms, Kogoro, and Conan are at the Saekis' house, ready to carry out the plan to catch Reina's kidnapper. Before the housekeeper, Suzuko Tanaka, sets out to deliver 100 million yen of ransom to the kidnapper, Conan sneakily places a transmitter on the her sleeve.\nAt 9:30 AM, Suzuko drives out the garage and heads toward Beika Central Park, where she is to arrive at around 10 by herself, according to the kidnapper's request. Meanwhile, Takagi and some other police officers, dressed up as ordinary people, are secretly observing the park in order to find any suspicious people. The police placed three transmitters - one in the bag containing ransom money, one on the car, and one in her brooch - in order to track down the kidnapper.\nSuzuko arrives at the park and receives a phone call from the kidnapper, who tells her to dig in the left corner of a sandbox. There, she finds a map inside a plastic bag, with the site of the demolished car factory in Haido shaded. The kidnapper, afraid there may be transmitters involved, has another car and bag at that place and will tell her to switch cars and bags, rendering two of the police's transmitters useless. Megure tells other police officers to quickly head to that place to install more transmitters but tells them to stop after learning the car the kidnapper prepared is in open space.\nAfter switching cars and bags at the demolished factory, she gets another phone call from the kidnapper, who instructs her to spend all the ransom money on ten diamonds, at the Matsubara jewelry store. The kidnapper bought those diamonds under President Saeki's name. At 10:45, she walks out of the store with Akira Matsubara after purchasing the diamonds; meanwhile, Detectives Takagi and Chiba are in a car, watching her quietly from behind. The kidnapper calls her again and tells her to drive slowly to Sakura Street and turn left at the first set of traffic lights. The police thinks she is going to Touto Central Station, but they were wrong. When she asks the kidnapper where she should go, the kidnapper tells her to throw her brooch away. That person suspected she was carrying some wire since she repeated all of the kidnapper's instructions and, with binoculars, figured out there was a transmitter in her brooch. Afterwards, Takagi and Chiba tell Megure, Sato, and Kogoro that the kidnapper already prepared a bicycle and she rode it through an alley to escape them. The police have lost contact with her.\nMeanwhile, Conan, with his skateboard and criminal tracking glasses (his transmitter is still on Suzuko's sleeve), pursuits the housekeeper, who is at a pier. He asks her where the diamonds are, and she tells him the kidnapper told her to find a bottle with a red ribbon, put the diamonds in it, and send it down the river. After she tells him there are ants all over the bottle, Conan figures out the entire kidnapping scheme. At sunset, Reina reunites with her family.\n",
    "People": "- 50 years old\n- Saeki family housekeeper\n- Victim (kidnapped)\n- 5 years old\n- Saeki family's only daughter\n- 55 years old\n- Reina's father\n- Money loaning company president\n- 30 years old\n- Kenzo's wife\n- Reina's mother\n- 50 years old\n- Matsubara Jewelry Store owner\n- Birthday: 14th February\n- Reina's dance teacher\n- Tokyo MPD Police helicopter pilot\n",
    "Resolution": "Matsubara used the glass imitations to sack the ransom without financial loss to himself, and then freely spend it afterwards since he has acquired the money in a legitimate business transaction. In order to hide the fact that the purchased diamonds are fake, he instructed Suzuko to put them into the marked glass bottle, which is really made of sugar glass, which would eventually dissolve in water, sinking the fake diamonds to the bottom of the river. However, Conan recovered the bottle before Reina was returned to her parents, which is a decisive clue that the diamonds are fake. In addition, Conan figured out the true nature of the bottle after Suzuko told him about the ants crawling all over the bottle, since ants are attracted to sugar. Following its recovery, the serial number on the intact bottle could be used to track down its purchaser.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is the latest episode to be written by the screenwriter Takeo Ohno.\n- Suzuko Tanaka car drive is a Black Mercedes-Benz C-Klasse [W204]. The license plate number is 新宿 330, さ 42-50 (Shinjuku 330, Sa 42-50).\n- Suzuko Tanaka's van is a 1999 White Mazda Bongo Friendee.\n"
