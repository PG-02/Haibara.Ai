    "Situation": "Conan, Ran, and Kazuha, who came to Tokyo, visited the Haido Shrine, which was best known for matchmaking. Owing to the encounter of the \"115 fate\" day, the shrine was rather crowded. Ran previously did not know about this popular attraction and inquired of Kazuha how she became aware of it. Kazuha explained it was because of Heiji, as she haphazardly saw him looking up information with regards to this shrine. From these recent words and deeds, Conan was convinced that Heiji was also there, and he soon found a suspicious man wearing a fox mask. On the other hand, Kazuha noticed a person among the crowd who did not seem to have the intent of matchmaking.\nConan found Heiji while poking around the shrine platform, and also teased him using the voice-changing bowtie, which imitated Kazuha's voice. Heiji reiterated the previous attempts at confession, the first time was interrupted by a zombie actor; the second time was interrupted by a paratrooper from the Japanese Air Defense Force; the third time was interrupted by an emergency case; the fourth time was for the same reason; the fifth time at Kiyomizu-dera was taken one step ahead by Shinichi; the sixth time was because Kazuha was disguised by Kid; and the seventh time, Kazuha got dragged away by Iori when Heiji was about to confess. After all of these failures, Heiji realised that the thing he had been missing was not beautiful sights or situations but luck. Therefore, he went to the shrine just to improve his luck. Heiji thus wore the fox mask with Conan's bowtie inside of it, this could allow him to change his sound without being discovered by Kazuha. Surprisingly, Kazuha mistook the masked Heiji for Komoto Hyoga of the Naniwa Kids. After some time, the suspicious person who did not seem to have an interest in matchmaking was later found dead and revealed to be a police investigator searching for criminals around the area. From Kazuha's findings, the victim chased after someone while he was waiting in the queue, and was apparently saying something like \"This really is a matchmaking shrine, that's three of them in one place.\"\n\nIt was liable to be believed that the victim slipped down the steps and died in an accident, but both Conan and Heiji believed that it was a murder. There was a flag without a pole abandoned in the middle of the steps, Heiji deduced that the weapon would possibly be the pole of the flag. Since carrying the entire flag while escaping would be too noticeable, the culprit thus decided to only take the pole. The criminals that the police investigator was searching for before his death were gathered together by the police. There were three suspects in the case: pickpocket and shoplifter Tsurumi Shamoto, a person who drove without a license and committed a hit-and-run, Torahiko Kawano, and marriage fraudster Kyouma Jinnai. The three of them were the criminals that Soushi had been capturing while he was alive.\nThe police verified their alibis when the crime was carried out, Tsurumi was tied to a lamppost at the bicycle parking area using the handcuffs, after being discovered by the victim. Torahiko bumped into some thugs and got into a fight with them near the entrance of the shrine, thanks to that, this attarcted loads of attentions towards the fight and gave the oppurtunity for the crime to be implemented without testimonies. Finally, Kyouma was finding his wallet during that time. Conan proposed another assumption, since there was a box used to store the flag poles and flags, those were supposed to be set up already, but due to the fight outbroke by Torahiko, the staff resposible for putting the flags went to spectate. The culprit might put the weapon pole inside the box, however, Sato rejected this theory, because forensics examined the stuff inside it, which did not find a match to the victim's blood component. So, where did the culprit hide the flag pole?\nIn the meantime, Ran thought that the \"Komoto\" kind of looked like Heiji, did Kazuha also identify the masked man's identity?\n- \"Naniwa Kids\" idol group member\n- TV personality\n- Hyouga's lover\n- Victim (bludgeoned)\n- 31 years old\n- Tokyo MPD Investigative cooperation department assistant inspector\n- 29 years old\n- Marriage fraud perpetrator\n- 30 years old\n- Repeated shoplifter\n- 38 years old\n- Unlicensed driver, causes hit-and-run\n- Torahiko's younger sister\n- Swindled by Kyouma\n- TV news announcer\n- Wanted criminal\n- Haido shrine visitor\n- Haido shrine visitor\n- Boy A's friend\n- Haido shrine visitor\n- Tourist\n- Hyouga's fan\n",
    "Resolution": "When the victim fixed Tsurumi near the lamppost at the bicycle parking area, she could easily swipe the handcuffs, and commit murder, then cuff herself again. Conan demonstrated the trick:\nUsing this trick, she could escape from the lamppost, and pretend to be trapped all the time as she came back. Actually, Tsurumi initially just wanted to escape after swiping the handcuffs, however, when she walked towards the exit, nearby the steps, she was discovered by the victim again, who claimed to capture her again. Therefore, she just casually took a heavy object nearby and hit the victim, the object was...\nThe actual weapon happened to be a water bucket that was originally left by a faucet. It had water inside, and due to the cold day, the water inside the bucket froze. The culprit grabbed this bucket and hit the victim's head without thinking. Moreover, to conceal this weapon, she put the bucket upside down on the head of a snowman, pretending it to be a decorative hat for the snowman. This got revealed by Conan when he heard a sound coming from the snowman, followed by a fall of the snowman's eye. That was because the ice inside the bucket had melted, and this created a change in momentum that exerted a force on the head of the snowman, causing the eye to fall.\nConan asked Heiji what kind of name would be a \"ridiculous\" name. Heiji jokingly answered \"Conan Edogawa\", before pointed out \"Doito Katsuki\", whose name can be rearranged into \"Kaito Kid\". Conan then thought about the name being an anagram.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- The anime add some original scenes not in the manga:\n- Conan asks Ran if he can go for a walk rather than standing in line, before go to approach Heiji.\n- Conan thinking the reason why the suspects stay at the shrine and if the flagpole is really the weapon.\n- Conan wondering if Kazuha would have known Heiji is the man behind the mask, and what Heiji will do if she knows.\n- Conversation between Conan and Kazuha about what Heiji might be doing at the moment.\n- While the cases where Heiji attempted to confess Kazuha were mentioned in the manga, the anime add flashback scenes of those cases.\n- In the manga, Shinichi is shown in the background while Conan is thinking about the mysterious sound. In the anime it is not shown.\n- The anime change how Sato deal with Kawano when he got provoked by Heiji. Instead of hitting Kawano on the head, Sato pulls his ear.\n- The anime add more reaction from Shamoto when she heard Kawano is responsible of her current condition. She tried to kick Kawano several times, and when Takagi tried to calm them down, Shamoto kicked Takagi several times.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The organizer and storyboard of this case, Hatsuki Tsuji, is in charge of manga case storyboard once again after thirteen years. He worked on the last two episodes of The Crisis Beckoned by the Red Omen.\n- The suspects' names are related to animals and make the kanji for Hikawa Shrine (氷川神社), which was the set model for Haido Shrine[1]:\nSoushi Hidaka (氷高 創志) is the \"Hi\" (氷) in Hikawa and comes from \"ox\" (ウシ, ushi);\nTorahiko Kawano (川野 寅彦) is the \"kawa\" (川) in Hikawa and comes from \"tiger\" (トラ, tora);\nKyouma Jin'nai (神内 恭麻) is the \"Jin\" (神) in Jinja (shrine) and comes from \"horse\" (ウマ, uma);\nTsurumi Shamoto (社本 鶴美) is the \"Ja\" (社) in Jinja (shrine) and comes from \"crane\" (鶴, tsurumi);\nFurthermore, Usagi Mikage (三影兎) comes from \"rabbit\" (ウサギ, usagi) and \"shadow\" (影, kage);\nHyouga Koumoto (光本 兵我) comes from \"panther\" (ヒョウ, hyou) and \"light\" (光, kou), as opposed to Usagi who is \"shadow\".
