    "Situation": "Kazuyuki Kawai invites Kogoro, Ran, and Conan to his houseboat for dinner and to view the fireworks. During the fireworks, Kawai's guest, Tsuneo Yamazaki, is found dead.\n\nKogoro deduces that Yamazaki had slipped on some water and fell, causing his fishing rod to touch exposed electrical wiring, electrocuting him.\n",
    "People": "- 22 years old\n- Unabara Boat cook and customer support\n- Fukuo's daughter[1]\n- 50 years old\n- Unabara Boat captain\n- 65 years old\n- Engineering shop president\n- Victim (electrocuted)\n- 60 years old\n- Finance company president\n- Tokyo Bay station policeman\n- 45 years old\n- Shiokaze Boat captain\n",
    "Resolution": "Kawai tries to deny it, claiming that he would have died too. Kogoro says, he would have, if he was bare handed and bare footed like Yamazaki. Then he ask to show what's inside in his pocket and it was skin colored rubber gloves. Using those for fishing seems pretty unusual, but Kawai claims he only had them in his, and that the death was still an accident.\nThere was a discrepancy in their position when they fell. If he pulled the fishing line from the side of the boat, the fishing line would've been pulled vertically. If the line gets cut from the side of the boat, he should also fall vertically. But, in order for the fishing rod to touch the electric wire, it would have to fall parallel to the side of the boat. In other words, as soon as the fishing line was cut, he pushed Yamazaki in a parallel direction. By doing this, the fishing rod made contact with the electric wire. He had intention to kill.\nKawai continues to say that he's not the culprit and demands solid evidence. Kogoro explains that the solid evidence is Kawai's lighter. When tested, it won't light up. He had lit up a cigarette with the lighter before the departure, so why is it not working anymore? There is a piece of vinyl stuck on the lighter's wick. It happened when he was burning the electric wire: he used the lighter to melt the rubber coating leaving the electric wire exposed, causing the vinyl to fall onto the wick. After that, he wore his rubber boots on the deck and the skin colored gloves for electrical insulation. After that, he executed his plan and electrocuted Yamazaki. Then, by keeping a falling pose, he took the boots off and threw them away, hid the rubber gloves in his pocket, and pretended to be unconscious.\n",
