Mr. Head requests Kogoro to find the one who killed his son among the group members. If he doesn't do it or if he calls the police, then Ran will be killed.\nThat evening, Takagi and Satou pose as a wealthy couple to infiltrate an illegal casino with Megure and the rest waiting outside as attacking force. Unfortunately, the casino is also the same one that the robber group targets for their loots.\n\nConan quickly follows the robbers and Kogoro through the sewer system, using shortcut to get ahead of them. After reaching the exit, he hides in Miss Lip's car. Soon enough, the robbers and Kogoro exit the tunnel and get on the car and drive off as they're chased by the police. Using her ungodly driving skill, Miss Lip successfully causes all the police cars, among them Megure and Chiba, to crash. She also notice that the car's back weight strange, and cause the robbers to discover Conan hiding in it. Meanwhile at the agency, Ran receives a call from the police, with someone spying on her from afar.\nAs the group reaches their hideout, they find that it is made to resemble the crime scene where Mr. Pimple, a.k.a. Mr. Head's son, was killed. All of them, including Kogoro and Conan, is locked inside, until the culprit is revealed.\n\n",
