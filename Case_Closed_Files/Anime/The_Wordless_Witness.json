Hikaru is known as shut-in, currently unemployed, and a Yoko Okino's big fan. Kogoro and Conan try to question Hikaru, but he only text his mother that he did not see anything. Conan deduces that Hikaru might actually see something or the culprit might saw Hikaru.\nLater, Conan notice that one of Hikaru's shoes is dirtier than other shoes.
