    "Situation": "A man named Masaki Higuchi is showing a poster of his missing wife Tomomi Higuchi to several people while he is getting wet from the rain. Ran and Conan approach him with an umbrella to offer him shelter and ask to see the poster. Ran immediately recognizes Tomomi from her workplace, a florist shop. Masaki asks for their help and Ran suggests he talk to her father Kogoro Mouri, known as \"Sleeping Kogoro\".\nAt the detective agency, Masaki tells them what he knows. He had planned a date with his wife Tomomi at an expensive restaurant but she never showed up. Kogoro asks if maybe she ran off, but Masaki tells him that that is impossible as they had a happy life together. As evidence, he reveals that her phone and wallet were left behind, something a person running away would never do.\nMasaki asks Kogoro to investigate the case for him which he accepts. Kogoro along with Conan question Masaki's neighbors, getting different statements from them but nothing to lead them to Tomomi.\n\nAs Kogoro and Conan are walking around the neighborhood, they hear Masaki arguing with someone and go to investigate. They find detective Takagi with two officers. Kogoro asks what is wrong and Masaki reveals that Takagi came to dig up his garden because they believe Masaki killed his wife and buried her in their own backyard.\nMasaki lets them dig stating that they will not find anything as he believes Tomomi is still alive. However the officers find Tomomi's body in the garden, much to Masaki's shock and grief.\n\n",
    "People": "- 32 years old\n- Office worker\n- Kogoro's client\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- 29 years old\n- Masaki's wife\n- Florist\n- Amateur actress\n- Next door neighbor of the Higuchis\n- Housewife\n- Man living in front of the Higuchis\n- Retired\n- Man living diagonally from the Higuchis\n- Man living behind Higuchis\n- Suspicious neighbor\n- Bandage on forehead\n- Woman living behind the Higuchis\n- Suspicious neighbor\n- Scratches on legs\n- Woman living behind the Higuchis\n- Suspicious neighbor\n- Bandages on left arm\n- Woman C's son\n- Tokyo MPD police officer\n- Tokyo MPD police officer\n",
    "Resolution": "Her motive was that Tomomi had decided to cut some branches off her tree, as it was blocking the sunlight necessary for her garden. Sakie had gone to confront her and had stepped through Tomomi's rose garden which was extremely thorny explaining the scratches on her legs. Tomomi was trying to explain why she cut the branches off her tree, but Sakie wouldn't have it and shoved the garden sheers into Tomomi killing her.\nSeeing what happened she buried Tomomi's body in her own garden and left hoping she would never be found. However, Tomomi's husband Masaki Higuchi started to look for her as a result Kogoro was put on the case and he started asking the neighbors questions about Tomomi. Sakie saw this as a opportunity to frame Masaki and falsely told Kogoro that Tomomi and Masaki got into arguments often. And when Kogoro questioned the other neighbors they claimed the same thing, until it was revealed that Tomomi was also an aspiring actress. Which meant that all the \"arguing\" they heard was just acting from Tomomi's scripts that she was rehearsing with Masaki.\nWalking near Masaki and Tomomi's home they hear Masaki yelling and see that Takagi and some MPD officers have arrived to his house. Masaki asks Kogoro for help, stating that the police said that they believe that Tomomi's body is buried in their garden. Takagi reveals that they got an anonymous tip from a phone call and decided to act. They later found Tomomi's body in the garden much to Masaki's shock and grief. It is later revealed that Sakie sent that anonymous tip in the hopes of framing Masaki for good.\nIronically this backfired as this was what made Conan suspicious, which ended up helping solve this case. The evidence to prove her guilt was her blood on the rose bushes and on the garden sheers that was used to kill Tomomi. Sakie reveals that she felt inferior after watching her and Masaki working so happily on their garden it make her sick and envious. She was pushed over the edge when Tomomi started cutting branches off her tree and caused her to kill her in retaliation.\n\n",
    "Trivia": "- The case shares similarities with The Missing Girlfriend, written by Tatsuro Inamoto.\n- The restaurant where Masaki had a date with his wife is Arsène, the skyview restaurant which appeared in The Desperate Revival, and he was bringing his wife a Fusae Brand gift.\n- The play Tomomi is cast in is Shakespeare's Othello.\n- The police car from The High School Girl Trio's Secret Café reappeared.\n"
