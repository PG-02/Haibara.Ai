    "Situation": "The Detective Boys are at a small ski resort. Conan had told Haibara and the professor about the case, Touji who witness Kir's accident and that Vermouth learn about it. It turns out that the man, who was hired by the murderer for the strange garbage job was a big fan of Mizunashi Rena and ran a homepage about her. On it he had written about meeting Touji who talked about the accident after seeing the man's stadium jumper with Kir's picture on it. Both Vermouth and Eisuke Hondou have read the web journal and seek out to meet the boy and question him about the accident. So now both Hondou and the organization knows that Kir has been injured and is probably in a hospital. The detective boys meet up with four university students who are building a snowman for an art project. Later that evening, Sakuko Kokura, one of the university students, becomes lost in the blizzard and the two groups begin their search for her. Conan finds Kokura dead at the bottom of a cliff in a lake.\n\nThe police declare that Kokura's death was a snowboarding accident. However, Conan notices that the body is missing a hat, goggles, and gloves and believes that she was murdered and that one of the university students is the culprit.\nGenta trips and falls into the snow and comments how it was hard and salty. Conan realizes how the murder was done and gathers the suspects along with Inspector Misao Yamamura.\n",
