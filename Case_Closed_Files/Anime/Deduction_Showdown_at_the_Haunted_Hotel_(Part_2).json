The guy in the blue hat tells Sonoko that he's not a pervert but Sonoko thinks he's lying. So she told Ran to beat him up. Ran does as she says so she kicks but the guy in the blue hat blocks Ran's kick with his leg. He punches and Ran dodges. He kicks and Ran dodges again. Ran realizes that her opponent is using Jeet Kune Do. The guy in the blue hat is trying to explain that he's not a pervert but Conan explain for him instead. Conan saw that the real pervert was about to touch Sonoko's butt and the guy in the blue hat stopped the pervert. Sonoko got really mad at the real pervert.

She asks Conan where he's going and Conan told Hirukawa that he's going to cake buffet at the second floor. Hirukawa told Conan that he can't use the elevator because she says it goes to the annex. Conan thought the annex was under the renovation. Ran apologizes to Hirukawa and she says it's okay. She suggest that they should help each other when in need. Hirukawa's friends found Hirukawa and she apologizes them for keeping them waiting. While Ran, Sonoko, and Conan left, the man mentions how the person is doing. Hirukawa explain that the person was drunk and keeps shouting curses as usual. She says that after she scolded the person severely, the person started crying. Hirukawa also says the person wants to apologize to everyone and admits his sins, so the person like them to go up to his room. After that, Hirukawa suggest for her friends to take a car ride and buy a recording device to record the person's repentance.\nRan, Sonoko, and Conan are at the entrance to the cake buffet in the first floor. The stairs full of people. Suddenly, they heard a big bang sound from the parking lot. Hirukawa and her friends found something terrible and screamed. Conan went to the parking lot to check what's going on. The man is found dead.\n\nConan ask what happened and they said while they back up the car, the man just fell from above. The person that Hirukawa and her friends were talking about was Uesumi. Ran, Sonoko, and the security guard are coming to see what's going on. Suddenly, Hirukawa just saw someone suspicious on the roof. Conan told Ran to call the police and keep watch over the crime scene. Conan is going to the top of the hotel with Hirukawa and her friends. While they're at the top floor, the elevator has both front and rear doors. They check outside and found shoes on top of the jacket. Hirukawa's friends think it's suicide but Conan said it isn't suicide. Conan said it's, but the guy in the blue hat said \"Murder\".
