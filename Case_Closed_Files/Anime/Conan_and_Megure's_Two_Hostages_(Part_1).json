    "Situation": "Conan goes out to purchase popular mystery novels in a bookstore, and by chance, he encounters two people (a man named Hayato Wakai and a woman named Chiaki Wakai) carrying a child, whose name is Kazuo Mimura. As they gaze at each other, the child throws a gachapon towards Conan. Upon opening the toy capsule, Conan sees a tiny Kamen Yaiba figurine and a folded piece of paper. Unfolding it, Conan discovers that the child was being kidnapped, and written on the paper was \"HELP\" (たすけて).\n\nAfter Conan interprets the signal of crisis, he tails the three into a hotel, where in the hall of the hotel he learns their room number. When he knocks on the door, he quickly dashes into the room. He pretends he's merely there to return the gachapon dropped by Kazuo. To understand the situation, Conan pulls the boy into the bathroom, where he asks Kazuo for information. He searches the bathroom and finds there are absolutely no exits to the exterior. Meanwhile, outside the bathroom, Hayato urges the two kids to get out. Conan, realizing they both have similar appearances, exchanges clothes with Kazuo. This was the best option to save Kazuo from the kidnappers.\nAnd that's how Conan found himself sitting in the kidnappers' minivan. Conan persistently observes their behavior in the back seat. He deduces that the two kidnappers were a couple based on the rings on each of their ring fingers. Conan also notices some stains on the back of the front seat. The two kidnappers don't seem to be experienced in kidnapping; they act like amateurs. Instead of plotting the abduction themselves, they follow instructions printed on a notepad, possibly written by somebody else. Just after that, Conan witnesses Hayato calling Kazuo's father, Masami Mimura, on a public telephone, per commands printed on the notepad.\nSince Conan brought the Voice-Changing Bowtie with him, when the kidnappers intended to communicate with the hostage \"Kazuo\", Conan was able to deceive them by imitating Kazuo's voice using the bow tie. All of a sudden, Conan proclaims that he is starving and wants dumplings and shumai. The couple go to a Chinese fast-food restaurant and let Conan eat. At the same time, Hayato calls Kazuo's father once again, demanding a three million yen ransom in cash. By reading the instructions, Hayato informs Mimura that the money must be available within an hour. Mimura, in turn, requests to hear Kazuo's voice through the telephone, and Conan, with the help of his bowtie, impersonates Kazuo.\nAt the Mimura Residence, the police from Investigation Division One are investigating the situation. After Mimura hangs up, he tells the police the \"Kazuo\" he heard from the phone called him \"dad\" rather than \"papa\", causing him to question the credibility of the voice. Megure learns that there are two kidnappers involved and has some composite sketches of their faces. By contacting Sato, Takagi now knows the names of the kidnappers as well as the vehicle they are driving. With this information, Inspector Megure organizes checkpoints on the roads that the two kidnappers are likely to drive through.\nOn the road, Chiaki and Hayato are intercepted by the police at one of the checkpoints. The two of them are nervous, as they will be discovered if Conan says anything in front of the police. Meanwhile, Conan finds a mini toy car stuck within the gap between two car seats, which has the name \"Tetsuya\" (てつや) written underneath. Conan smirks, now realizing what happened. The couple manages to conceal the kidnapping affairs happening within the minivan. The officers, seeing nothing out of sorts, let them go. As they drive away from the checkpoint, both kidnappers are puzzled with Conan's behavior; normally, any person would call for aid when a police officer was in front of them. Conan responds to their confused comments, but this time he uses his current voice. Conan mentions their anxieties as he surmises that their primary intent was not to carry out crimes but to save their own child, Tetsuya Wakai, who also got kidnapped. Conan deduced this because of the toy car that Tetsuya had lost a month ago. Conan reveals his identity to the couple.\nAs this unfolds, Kazuo, who exchanged clothes with Conan earlier, has been wandering around the tremendous city, lost and helpless. He remembers that Conan told him to find Detective Takagi from Investigation Division One; however, he has a difficult time finding the police on the street. Kazuo then attempts to go home; knowing that his home is located in the direction of Shibuya, he enters a metro station. Unluckily, he got on the train, which went in the opposite direction (South Tokyo). Will Kazuo be able to arrive home successfully and notify his family?\nConan explains that he understood everything and knew the couple was forced to follow somebody's instructions with the desire to get their child Tetsuya back. He expresses his willingness to assist them in bringing justice to light.\nConsequently, Chiaki recounted the events of the previous evening: she abruptly received an anonymous phone call demanding that she follows his demands at the risk of Tetsuya's life. After a thorough search, they were convinced Tetsuya was kidnapped, and they began to make use of the briefcase sent by the culprit. From there, they had the idea to kidnap Kazuo.\nConan examines the instructions sent by the culprit and quickly deduces that the true intention is to throw the kidnapped Kazuo into the sea, effectively sealing his fate. Although the instructions don't state this explicitly, the phrase \"place the ransom and everything else into the sea\" implies Kazuo's life is at risk. Fortunately, Conan, the astute detective, intervenes. He proposes a plan to outsmart the culprit and save Kazuo.\nConan contacts the Mimura family again and firmly requests to speak with Inspector Megure. This time, he adopts a wise and authoritative tone, advising the family to split the ransom money into two parts and load them onto separate vehicles. The two vehicles should be on standby at precisely 2 PM and travel in opposite directions at a speed of 50 kph.\nDue to the presence of an APBAll-Points Bulletin within the parking lot, Conan suggests they abandon their van and purchase disguises to evade the comprehensive police inspection. He emphasizes the importance of this move, reminding them that their opponent is the formidable Inspector Megure from Investigation Division One, a force not to be underestimated.\n",

    "Resolution": "",
    "Megure's Deduction": "After some time, Conan called Inspector Megure for one final time, and told him that the two vehicles would need to be placed on the highway by the Nishi-Sawabukuro exit. After the call had hanged up, everyone working in the case were rather anxious. Megure, on the other hand, remarked that he did not like the culprit's plan, because he realised this:\n- At the outset kidnappers were using fairly amateur-ish language to conduct the abduction, ever since the stage of hostage exchanging, the tone of the culprit had changed drastically. As a result, Megure deduced that someone else had joined the criminal group for assistance.\n- In addition to that, the \"new\" criminal was no amateur, as the manner of retrieving ransom looked extremely professional - suppose two vehicles one travel clockwise and the other anti-clockwise, this would divert the police's focus if it was on a looped highway.\n- Since the two vehicles will be travelling at specified speed, it would be perfectly possible for the culprit to keep track of them in real-time.\n- If the culprit had disclosed the plain location of the vehicles, it is possible that the money-hostage exchanging is a decoy or some sort; upon that, the culprit might not after the ransom completely.\nFinally, Megure's instinct tells that the culprit are on the opposite side of the loop highway from Sawabukuro - Chiba Park.\n",
    "Conan's Deduction": "From the anonymous phone call that Chiaki received yesterday, she sensed some low rumbling sound coming from the other side. After interpreting it, Conan related it with the construction noise - after the confirmation with Chiaki, they could narrow down the location of where Tetsuya was being kidnapped.\nConan then requested to check the photo of Tetsuya sent by the kidnapper out again, he adjusted the brightness of the photo, making it lower with the editing software: Boom! They were able to see the outside buildings through the large windows in that photo. Apparently, a part of the Toto Tower was seen within the window, this shows that the building that Kazuo was at must be beside the tower.\nBy looking up the construction sites currently in operation online, Conan found the one located with the shortest displacement with respect to the Toto Tower. Rapidly rushing, they arrived at an apartment situated beside Toto Tower. Conan speculated that the room Tetsuya was being held hostage is on the 4th floor as based on the altitude from the photo, it was pretty obvious to note. Simultaneously, within the mailbox of room 402 there were invariably full of unread letters; therefore, it is unoccupied and the best fit for a kidnapping room.\n",
    "Rescuing Tetsuya!": "Conan's deduction possessed absolutely no loopholes; as they force-broke the door of that room obstructed by wooden planks, they successfully saved Tetsuya.\nThe utmost thing to learn about was, who owned that room? Hence, Conan called Chiba to investigate the owner of the 402 room. As Chiba responded, the owner is the room is a company named Cybil, Ltd. The director name is Sakae Mimura (the 2nd son of Masami Mimura) and Naho Mimura is one of the executives.\nAccording to that, Conan figured out almost everything: the culprit is Naho Mimura, without a doubt. The culprit must be some one who knows Chiaki and has her phone number, otherwise Chiaki would not be able to be directly called by the culprit. Being a college classmate with Naho, Chiaki recognises very well the smell that permeated the room Tetsuya got kidnapped, in which Naho always had fancied this type of fragrance.\nAs a result, letting Naho to \"take Kazuo home\" is yet to put Kazuo in danger.\n",
    "Rescuing Kazuo!": "Chiaki explained that Naho was a fairly popular student among their class and was pursed by many followers, the reason she plotted this double abduction case is only to leave dirty works to other people, just like her immutable personality she possessed throughout the years. Now, she is driving Kazuo to a cliff, Conan already got the police informed about it and everybody is willing to capture the culprit Naho.\nConan reached out to Megure and justified all the misconceptions between them, and obviously - got told off by him.\nWithin the car, before ending Kazuo's life, Naho narrated the motive of doing all of those matters: Masami and she were on the verge of divorcing; however, Kazuo is not her son, but Sakae is. For Sakae to inherit the Mimura company legacy, all she could do was to murder Kazuo. In the nick of time, Conan and Megure arrived timely (thanks to the Detective Boys Badge that remained on Kazuo's clothes so Conan was able to locate his location) upon the helicopter to impede Naho's insane behaviours - and - Kazuo was saved!\n",
