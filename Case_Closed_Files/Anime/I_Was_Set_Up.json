    "Situation": "One of Kogoro's clients, Hiroaki Sanada, requested Kogoro to cease the detective service he entrusted the minute they first met as the pre-agreed schuedle. This exceptional behaviour striked Kogoro odd, and asked him the reason behind it deeply. After countless urgings, Sanada explained the logic: three mornings ago, an extotionist Jiro Inumaru kept blackmailing Sanada to expose some not-so-pleasant matters he had done working as a real estate agency manager to his company. But afterwards, Sanada's friend, Daigo Kawakatsu dropped in and manefisted his anger; as a result, he told Sanada to inform him in advance the next time the extortionist Inumaru bothers him. And yesterday morning... Inumaru came to Sanada's house and was about to grab him by the neck, but Sanada pushed him back with appreciable strength, which, unfortunately, led to a tragedy of murdering Inumaru as his head hit the corner of a table; Kawakatsu then arrived there after being informed by Sanada and saw teh scenario, he examined the corpse and confirmed Sanada to be dead.\n\nTo help Sanada, Kawakatsu thought up an idea of burying the corpse of Inumaru in a deserted location that would not be easily approached. They went into the woods and dug a hole, ready to place the copse inside, but then Kawakatsu told Sanada to go home and he would take care of the rest, and the reasoning was to help him fabricate an alibi. After all the touch-ups were made, seemingly perfect, and the two of them were resting in Sanada's house, obviously with a tinge of worridness and sorrowness, but at the same time, smirking with triumph in the bottom of their hearts. In that instant, a woman rang the electric bell of the house; and she claimed to be swindled by Inumaru as well, and would want to have her lost money back. If they do not come to an agreement, she will call the police otherwise. Kawakatsu suggested Sanada just silence the woman by giving her an equal amount of money to terminate this dispute, or else things would become bothersome and complicated. And after that, he did so obediently, and the value he gave away was 30 million yen.\nAfter hearing the story, Kogoro perceived something fishy there: only Sanada's friend Kawakatsu knew that he had 30 million yean in cash stored in his safe at home; it was Kawakatsu who claimed Inumaru's death, and Sanada did not interfere with it. Therefore, Kogoro and Conan thought that this was probably a trap set up by the three people (Inumaru, Kawakatsu, and that random woman), to swindle Sanada 30 million yen. On their way to that place where yesterday morning Sanada and Kwakatsu buried the \"corpse\" of Inumaru, Kogoro told him his asuumption, but Sanada did not believe it, he was convinced that he was the sole murderer in this incident and was about to turn himself in. Kogoro began digging the hole, trying to prove to Sanada that Inumaru might have faked his death, which was glossed over by Kawakatsu. Supposedly, Inumaru's body should not be found if his deduction was correct, but the reality was naughty enough to tease everyone: Inumaru's corpse was found! In the exact same place as Sanada buried it yesterday morning.\nInspector Megure and Detective Takagi arrived there as quick as ever, they found a button that belonged to Kawakatsu along with the corpse of Inumaru. They concluded the case with \"Sanada killing Inumaru accidentally and Kawakatsu conspirated him of concealing the body\" and took them to the station. Kogoro attempted to justify the deeper connotation behind the case, but Megure neglected it and thought the case must be simple and Kogoro ought not to overthink it.\nConan assuredly knew that the case was not this simple, he began investigating the case in a deeper fashion. He visited Sanada's residence and inquired of Sanada's housekeeper, Sueko Fueki. She was not helping out in Sanada's house yesterday because she went to stay overnight at her son's house. When Conan was mandering around Sanada's house, he found a receipt from a department store, and saw a photo of Sanada and his wife. He began to ask the housekeeper, Fueki, about the woman within that photo. And he got the answer that Sanada's wife passed away ten years ago, in an unmitigated accident - back then, a thief broke into the house and was seen by Sanada's wife, the culprit pushed her and fled, resulting in the injury of her leg. This was evidently the kicker of her falling down the stairs half a month later...\n\nBefore leaving the police station, the housekeeper felt regretful and disclosed that she should not have left the house. After listening to Sanada, who gave her a present offered by a friend of his from Hokkaido, and asked her to stay a night at her son's home by taking the present along. She could not anticipate the chaos that had been constructed over merely a single night. Despite that, Conan still parted ways with the housekeeper and decided when to reunite with Kogoro.\nOn Kogoro's end, he had caught the woman who took part to swindling Sanada; and she admitted the sin effortlessly. But she claimed that she knew nothing about the follow-ups, and she stated that the only time the three of them stayed together was on Wednesday night, at a certain izakaya. This final sentence had cleared all the perplexity within Conan's mind. His glasses shone, reflecting the intense sunlight illuminating upon it - he found the truth.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (bashed?)\n- 35 years old\n- Extortionist\n- Former robber\n- 42 years old\n- Real estate agency manager\n- 42 years old\n- Retail store manager\n- Inumaru's accomplice\n- 27 years old\n- Inumaru's accomplice\n- 70 years old\n- Sanada household housekeeper\n- Deceased (fell)\n- 29 years old (10 years ago)\n- Hiroaki's late wife\n",
    "Resolution": "Kogoro deduced that everything prior was exactly as he believed from the outset: the three of them tried to swindle Sanada by faking Inumaru's death. However, Kawakatsu, as one of the accomplices, decided to expand the money he got in the end, by taking down one of the people among the three of them, in order to attain a higher share. This deduction can be supported since it was later revealed by the police that, according to Inumaru's autopsy, he was estimated to be killed yesterday around 5PM, which contradicts the sayings from Sanada, who killed Inumaru in the morning.\nKawakatsu hesitated, but continued to insist that he did not commit the crime; the woman also had the possibility of committing the crime. But right after, Kogoro denied it. Since only Sanada and Kawkatsu knew the location of Inumaru's corpse was buried; the other accomplice cut the connection with the others after they swindled Sanada successfully.\n\"In other words,\" said Kogoro in a rather proud tone. \"You're the only one who could have done it.\"\n",
    "A Twist Over a Twist": "Sanada thanked Kogoro hardly as he helped him to prove his integrity and innosence; however, Conan quickly tranquilised Kogoro and began recounting the actual truth.\nThe culrpit is not Kawakatsu, but rather, the so-called victim, Hiroaki Sanada. He knew everything from the start, including the plan that the three people was about to implement on him. On that Wednesday night, when the three of them were talking about who to swindle and obtain a fortune, Sanada was precisely sitting beside the three of them, within the same izakaya. He also heard the fact that Inumaru was the thief who broke into his house ten eyars ago, and made her wife's leg get injured. He thought that if it were not for him, his wife would not have passed away.\nSo he knew everyone the three of them were going to make and pretended to be swindled; eventually, he killed Inumaru that night. Afterwards, he hired a detective to make him surmise the way he wanted to, and he found Kogoro Mouri.\n\nThe evidence was clearly the receipt that the present Sanada gave the housekeeper. He bought the present himself; that's why there was a receipt from the department store in his house. His intention was to make his plan go according to his will, so any obstacles must be cleared; Fueki's absence would make things a lot easier.\nSanada confessed his crime; he claimed that he haphazardly found his phot with his wife and swore to take avenge for her. He dropped Kawakatsu's button near Inumaru's corpse to frame him (after knowing how his friend betrayed him).\n",

    "Trivia": "- The plot of this episode shares similarities with Murder Night Without a Perpetrator (犯人のいない殺人の夜), a novel written by Keigo Higashino.\n- The parody of the browser Google (グーグル ,Gūguru?), \"Guruguru\" (グルグル), reappeared this episode, but this time being the mobile version \"GuruGuru-m\"; prior to that, it made its appearance in episode 1100 and episode 1101 already.\n- Anime-original locations: Radon City (羅鈍市) and Tengu Town (天狗町).\n"
