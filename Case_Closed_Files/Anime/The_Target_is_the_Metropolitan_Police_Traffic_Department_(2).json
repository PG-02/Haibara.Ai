    "People": "- Victim (defenestrated)\n- 28 years old\n- Traffic Department Assistant Inspector\n- Victim (bludgeoned)\n- 28 years old\n- Traffic Department Sergeant\n- Assaults Touko and Shiori\n- Kidnaps Naeko\n- Deceased (fell)\n- Office worker\n- Suspect\n- Traffic offence: smartphone use while driving\n- Suspect\n- Traffic offence: motorbiking without helmet & wrong-way driving\n- Suspect\n- Traffic offence: driving without seatbelt & overdue inspection\n- 28 years old\n- Hostess\n- Touko and Shiori's old classmate and close friend\n- Nicknamed \"Yumi\"\n- Neighbor\n- Drunkard\n- Drunkard\n",
    "Resolution": "\nThe \"No parking\" sign is an overlapping of the letters N and O, meaning \"No\". The color blue of the sign is pronounced as \"Ao\" in japanese. The two words combined gives \"Aono\". Furthermore, the \"7155\" message that the second victim left, is a reference to the article of japanese traffic law, that mentions that a driver must never use his cellphone while driving. Aono's girlfriend committed suicide the week before. He drove without his license while trying to call her, which got him caught by the two police women, Touko and Shiori, who held him back. He believed that he could have prevented the suicide, if they had let him go, and that they wasted time, when they got a call from their friend Yumiko, known as Yumi to them, who invited them to karaoke. But Chiba explains that he was held back, because he could have caused an accident, especially if he drove his car in a panic. Moreover, right after he got his girl friend's text message with a goodbye she had called him and left him a voicemail, that also recorded her fall. It proves that he could never have stopped her in any circumstances. Aono missed the voicemail, because he had been busy trying to call her phone and because he was too distressed to notice, realizing that he murdered two innocent women he breaks down crying.\n\nChiba finally recognises Naeko as his childhood friend after the latter used the same words that Chiba said to her about not crossing the red light and respecting traffic laws.\n",
