    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Ran, feeling she met the mysterious man before, attempts to remember why. Jodie interrupts the daydreaming Ran in class and asks her the meaning of X to which she is unable to answer correctly. On the way home, they meet Jodie who takes them to the café in a department store to warn them about a serial groper. Conan notices a business man named Norihisa Kisugi making a suspicious phone call to a private detective agency director named Katsunori Chujou. Chujo demands Kisugi to pay four times the promised amount or he will not hand over the investigation documents concerning an unknown individual. Kisugi agrees and Chujo enters the department store only to be killed by the unknown culprit.\n\nA coincidental blackout occurs at the same time, and when the power returns, Chujo is found dead on the top of an escalator with ○×△ written on an envelope. The police understands the message to be a dying message, and using Chujo's phone, allows them to locate the last caller, Kisugi. Kisugi reveals that he hired the detective to search for an embezzler in the company. The documented that contained the embezzler's identity is missing from Chujo's envelope and the police discern the embezzler must be the culprit. Kisugi then hands them Chujo's list of fifty-eight suspects he had received. The police decrease the suspects down to thirty-one after investigating the alibis of the suspects. Conan tells the police a line of blood is found on the edge of the envelope and explains part of Chujo's dying message must be on the escalator. Using a luminol reaction, they discover □ revealing the whole message to be □○×△. Conan notes the square is much bigger than the other three symbol.\nConan's investigation leads him to discover the meaning of the symbols, right after Jodie giving him a small hint. Apparently she was watching him through the investigation.\n",
    "People": "- 50 years old\n- Trading company administrative manager\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- 43 years old\n- Detective agency director\n",
    "Resolution": "Conan drops hints to Inspector Megure to deduce what the symbols are. Megure explains that the symbols are outlines for kanji and □ is bigger than the other three symbols since it was not cut off. He elaborates further, explaining the three symbols are missing the top portion since they were written past the envelope and onto the document. The culprit is revealed to be Bunta Kuniyoshi (国吉文太, Kuniyoshi Bunta), correcting that the bottom of 吉 is usually more round. The police interrogate Kuniyoshi and convict him for the murder after Takagi gathers the shredded pieces of the documents with blood and piece them together forming the missing top portion of ○×△ and fully spelling Kuniyoshi's name. Kuniyoshi confesses explaining he wanted a better life for his poor family. Ran, learning the meaning of X, sends a mail to Shinichi with Xs. Elsewhere, Vermouth sends a message to Gin with X's in her message explaining they are a sign of feminine affection but can also be a sign of hate before throwing a dart at a picture of Shiho with an X through it.\n- Trading company employee\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- As Ran is distracted by trying to remember more about the man with a black cap and Shinichi's disappearance, the anime adds a scene where Sonoko is try to get Ran's attention before Jodie takes notice that the former isn't focusing on the assignment.\n- Episode 271 ends with Conan questioning why the □ symbol is larger than the other with the screen zooming out on him while showing all symbols in the background.\n- The anime shows Conan sneezing after Sonoko talks about how Shinichi lacks an understanding on certain subjects.\n- The manga clearly shows the word angel on Ran's photo while the anime very dimly add it to the picture, probably because the anime producers didn't know the reason Gosho Aoyama added that adjective on the picture which is known later in the anime.\n",
