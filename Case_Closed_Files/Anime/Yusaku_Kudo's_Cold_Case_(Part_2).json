    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "The case begins with a memory from the past, in which Shinichi's father, Yusaku Kudo, is shown telling Inspector Megure and Kogoro Mouri (who was a police officer at the time) that there is no need to worry about serial murder despite the ominous \"death\" character written next to the victim's body.\nRan, Sonoko, and Masumi are discussing the case abandoned by Yusaku Kudo when they come across people crowded around a dead body. The \"death\" character was written facing the body, indicating a possible murder. At Shinichi's house, Conan, Ran, Sonoko, Masumi, and Subaru inspect the photo from the case in the past; when the \"death\" characters in both cases are found to be similar, they are left wondering how Yusaku Kudo could have determined that the case was not a murder.\n\n\nIn a phone call with Ran as Shinichi, Conan hears that Subaru compared him to a ninja. Reminded of the Sanada flag with its six coins, Conan solves the mystery. After the phone call, Subaru witnesses Conan using the voice-changing bowtie.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (blood loss)\n- Deceased (stabbed)\n- Preschool principal\n- 5 years old (10 years ago)\n- Gangster Leader\n- Gangster\n- Gangster\n- Takaichi's co-worker\n- Takaichi's co-worker\n",
    "Resolution": "Takefumi Koriyama's death was an accident. The death characters were coincidental flukes made by candies and a thumb edge in Koriyama's case various items was placed by Ryosuke Nishimura in an attempt to make an offering, and the coins, the edge of a wallet, and a cigarette in Isao's case. The reason why the truth in Korriyama's death wasn't made public was to protect the child from being discredited, since his actions could be misunderstood as a prank. In reality his death was accidental, he had tripped and fallen while holding an empty fish bowl causing the resulting glass fragments to impale him when he fell.\nThe kanji did cause panic and fear for a possible serial killer, so the public could resent Ryosuke for causing it. Megure correctly ruled Isao's case to be a theft as some thieves stole Isao's wallet post-mortem. Isao had died due to the fact that he was an alcoholic, he had drank so much that his liver had shut down causing his death. At the same time he died he dropped his wallet and coins, which coincidentally landed in such a way that when his blood pooled on the ground it left a void in the form of the death kanji.\n\nThe thieves returned to the crime scene and attacked Masumi, Ran, Sonoko, and Conan to cover their involvement in the theft. A little Jeet Kun Do, karate, and a well placed soccer ball dispatched the thieves easily. Masumi's thoughts at the end of the episode seem to indicate she knows something about Shinichi's past.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The phone Conan uses for Shinichi is no longer a flip phone, but a smart phone.\n- The suspects' names come from \"administrative divisions in Japan\"[1] :\nTakefumi Koriyama (郡山 武文) comes from \"districts\" (郡) ;\nRyosuke Nishimura (西村 亮佑) comes from \"villages\" (村) ;\nIsao Takaichi (高市 勲) comes from \"cities\" (市).\n- Takefumi Koriyama (郡山 武文) comes from \"districts\" (郡) ;\n- Ryosuke Nishimura (西村 亮佑) comes from \"villages\" (村) ;\n- Isao Takaichi (高市 勲) comes from \"cities\" (市).\n- Takefumi Koriyama (郡山 武文) comes from \"districts\" (郡) ;\n- Ryosuke Nishimura (西村 亮佑) comes from \"villages\" (村) ;\n- Isao Takaichi (高市 勲) comes from \"cities\" (市).\n",
