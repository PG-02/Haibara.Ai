    "Situation": "Conan enters a Sherlock Holmes contest to win a rare first-edition book and persuades Ran Mouri and Kogoro to attend. Once at the place of the contest, everyone must take a 1000-question test about Sherlock Holmes. Heiji also attends and reveals to Ran that he thought he would meet Shinichi there. Later that day, Hiroyuki Kanaya, the host, is seen driving his car off a cliff and into the ocean.\n\nHiroyuki's death is presumed to be a murder and contestant Ayako Oki reveals she knows who the murderer is.\nLater a garage explosion and fire occurs, after dousing the flames Ayako is found dead.\n\nNext, a blackout occurred and Toshiaki Fujisawa, another contestant, is stabbed in the arm with an ice pick due to the timely intervention by Conan and Heiji who realize that the murderer is indeed among them.\n\nAfter Conan reveals his insight, Heiji believes Conan is actually Shinichi Kudo. Heiji reveals that, when Kanaya was in the car, his body had already undergone rigor mortis. At that moment, Conan and Heiji realize who the murderer is. Heiji decides to wait for Conan to solve the case in order to see if he really is Shinichi. Conan tranquilizes Heiji and makes his deduction.\n",

    "Resolution": "For Ayako's murder, Kento told Ayako the book was hidden in a car in the garage. The car had a punctured gas tank and the batteries were dead. With the batteries dead, the car’s headlights did not work, forcing Ayako to use her lighter, igniting the fire because of the gasoline fumes that had scattered over time. He killed her because she found out he was the murderer, Ayako found out he was the killer because she found evidence that proved he was the murderer.\nSince the garage fire was designed for Toshiaki, Kento decided to create a makeshift blackout and stab him. Togano was in the kitchen and he had the chance to manipulate the plug to create the blackout. Kento then asks Heiji for evidence, and Conan reveals the evidence Ayako discovered and mentioned: the questionnaire that they were all given.\nAyako had answered many of the questions however she did not know the answers to the other more difficult questions so she tried to cheat off of his questionnaire. However this unintentionally caused her to figure out that Kento was the murderer as she discovered that not a single question on the questionnaire had been filled in, because Kento apparently knew the host would be dead.\n",
