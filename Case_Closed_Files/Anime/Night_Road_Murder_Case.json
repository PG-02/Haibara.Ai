    "Resolution": "The weapon of choice was actually Takeno's socks, which are very resistent special socks used by sportsmen and specially by hikers. He easily filled them with lots of small rocks he got from an aquarium, since they wouldn't break; once he built a very hard and heavy \"weapon\", which would easily kill a person if used to hit them, Takeno put the used some fishing rope to tie everything up, and then launch it towards Ikuta, who was merely standing in the street while smoking.\n",
    "Translation changes": "",
    "Anime": "- The names of the characters in the Funimation Dub are:\n- Yoshiro Ikuta - Zachery Byers\n- Masami Kusaka - Shane Vanderburg\n- Yoichi Shimizu - Buford Pulmer\n- Kouji Takeno - Torman Lloyd\n- Hidenori Nakamura - Ned Armstrong\n- Keiko Togawa - Pamela Harding\n- In the Funimation Dub Kouji and Keiko had secretly eloped three weeks prior to the mountain trip, and he had taken a life insurance policy on her. When Yoshiro caught wind of his plan, Kouji had to cut him in. They worked together to kill Keiko for the money, however, when Kouji came to her, she was still alive, and he was the one that killed her, taking the chance as he was the first one in the group to reach her. His reason for killing Yoshiro in the dub was because Yoshiro was bragging about the plan while he was drunk.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is first episode where Wataru Takagi officially debuted in the anime, indicated by \"Detective Takagi\" written in the ending credit.\n- Although only 17-year-old, Ran is shown purchasing alcoholic drinks from the convenience store. (Accurate reflection of society at the time.)\n"
