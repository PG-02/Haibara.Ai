    "Situation": "One night at Mouri Detective Agency, while Kogoro is reading about horse racing on a newspaper, Ran, Sonoko, and Conan are watching \"Which Sweets Show\", a television program where two chefs compete to see who makes better sweets. Today, the defending champion, Shuuhei Kurimura, wins again, making him the winner for six weeks in a row. Thanks to Sonoko's father's connections, Ran, Sonoko, and Conan can watch the preview from the show's gallery next week. Sonoko, who needs to invite five people, baits Kogoro, who she needs to escort them, to come as well, by stating Yoko Okino will be one of the judges for next week's program. She is stuck on the last person to invite, and Ran's mother, Eri, cannot come because she has work.\nThe next day after school, Ran, Sonoko, and Conan ask Masumi if she wants to come to watch the program. In reality, Conan wants to invite her because he has something to ask her. As they talk about the TV show on their way home, Conan tells the girls he thinks Shuuhei is suspicious, since the champion always brought ingredients that suited the fruits chosen for the show. However, Ran and Sonoko tell him there is no way that pâtissier can cheat since the chest is always locked up before the show starts. Only the expert who packs the fruits in knows what is inside, so the TV staff has no chance to peek into it.\nOn the night before the show, Shoutoku Takeki arrives at Terafumi Kasuga's house. Terafumi tells Shoutoku the he already filled the chest up with the fruits that are to be used tomorrow. Shoutoku inspects the lock on the chest, is convinced it is secure, and made sure no one saw Terafumi fill the chest. At Nichiuri TV studio, the chest has arrived, so Toshihide Taruoka tells Wataru Furuya to lock that chest up and send it back to Shoutoku.\nThe day of the \"Which Sweets Show\" has arrived. Ran, Sonoko, Conan, Kogoro, and Masumi are already seated when suddenly Wataru Furuya asks Kogoro to go to the backstage. The recording of the TV show begins, and it turns out Yoko Okino and Kogoro Mouri, who is replacing Shoutoku Takeki because he is missing, are going to be the judges for this week's program. The contestants this week are Shuuhei Kurimara and Kurea Enokido. After Toshihide opens the lock of the chest of the key, the MC, Osamu Kenzaki, opens it to reveal the fruits. Ran tells Masumi, who thinks the lock can be forced open by anyone, that the lock has an electronic chip embedded, so a buzzer will ring if the wrong key is put in. Also, the lock is custom-made and the key to the lock is difficult to duplicate. Conan is about to quietly ask Masumi a question when suddenly the audience begins freaking out. The two of them are interrupted and they turn their heads toward the chest, only to see Shoutoku Takeki lying inside a pile of apples.\n\nConan and Masumi rush down from their seats to inspect the body. Shoutoku is already dead for more than half a day. After the audience is escorted to a separate room, the police come to investigate. Detective Takagi asks Producer Taruoka about chest-locking process, which was devised by Shoutoku Takeki himself. First, Terafumi Kasuga secretly fills the chest with fruits and locks it up. After that, the chest is sent to Nichiuri TV, where the producer asks his AD, Wataru Furuya, to put another lock on the chest before delivering it back to Terafumi. The food coordinator unlocks his own lock and then sends the chest back to the TV station. At the beginning of the show, the MC receives the key, which is stored in a safe at Touto Bank before the show, from the producer, and the fruits inside the chest is revealed to the contestants and the audience. As the police investigate, Terafumi arrives as well. The food coordinator is at Nichiuri TV because Shoutoku called him here, stating he will catch and expose the culprit who secretly reveals the contents of the fruit chest during the show. Shoutoku is probably doing this because the defending champion of the show won for six weeks in a row.\nSuddenly, Detective Chiba tells everyone that Shoutoku Takeki mixed in with the extras of yesterday night's historical play and snuck into the TV station. Blending in was easy, since he always wore a kimono and the extras did too. Apparently he asked the play's director, an acquaintance of his, to lower his enemies' guard. This means he hid in the room where the chest was stored but got ambushed by the culprit.\nThe police, Kogoro, Conan, Masumi, Terafumi, Toshihide, and Wataru are in the surveillance room, where they see Shoutoku enter the storeroom last night at 9:05. In the camera film, the next person that enters the room is the producer Toshihide Taruoka, who states he was checking to see if the chest arrived. After all, he is fully responsible if the its contents are leaked out. According to him, he was in that room for 30 minutes because he was searching for the chest. At 10:20, Wataru Furuya and two other AD's arrive in front of the storeroom. Wataru says he was in there for quite a while because he was smoking while checking his text messages after he quickly checked the chest. At 10:54, he came out of the room. After that, Terafumi Kasuga entered the storeroom and was in there for about half an hour to check the TV station's lock and take photos to show Shoutoku. He tells the police the chest was fully locked and so he went home after that. Nobody went in the storeroom the next day before the staff members took the chest, so those three people are the only ones that have a chance to commit the murder.\nAs the police continue investigating, Kogoro, Masumi, and Conan head back to the stage to try to solve the murder case; to do that, they need to figure out how the culprit even unlocked the chest in the first place. There are blood traces inside the chest, so Shoutoku was killed when the chest was open. The culprit is the one who opened it because the cuisine critic would not want anyone else besides Terafumi to know what is inside the chest. Kogoro wonders why there are so many apples in the chest when the contestants will not be using more than ten during the show. Sonoko and Ran come to the stage to tell them why. First of all, a full chest is visually appealing to the audience. Secondly, the extra fruits will be given to the gallery via lottery. In fact, the chest has a false bottom so that it will not be too heavy. The fruits inside the chest are rare, so many people apply to the gallery just to try to win those fruits. Kogoro tells them there is a bigger mystery than that: he wonders why Okino Yoko's hair, which was in her last live broadcast, suddenly became so long. Ran and Sonoko tell them it is because she used a hair extension; upon hearing this, Conan figures out who the culprit is.\nMasumi figures out too, and when she asked Conan if their thinking the same thing, he sees her left canine tooth as she smiles, confirming to himself he has seen her before. As the officers prepare to take the chest to conduct a thorough inspection, Conan asks them if those are all the apples in the chest. Even though the chest was supposed to completely full, there is a huge gap in the middle of the apples; however, the officers answer yes. Conan and Masumi found the evidence they need and run out the gallery. As Ran sees Masumi dash away, she thinks of waves; somehow, she can hear the sound of small waves when she sees Masumi running from behind, as if a spell was activated on her.\nConan and Masumi arrive at the storage room and ask Detective Takagi if the police found anything in the storeroom. He tells them when the police came to inspect the room, an AD was scolded because a kitchen prop that was to be used for the show was not properly washed. They tell him to bring the police and the suspects here for their magic show, which in fact is them explaining the truth behind the murder.\n",

    "Resolution": "On the night before the show, Takeki surprised him as he had suspected that someone was leaking the contents of the chest to Shuuihei Kurimura and had hid in the room to catch the person in the act. Takeki had seen him open the treasure chest, and in the ensuing quarrel Furuya killed him and placed his corpse in the chest, but, as this trunk was always filled with fruits to the brim, he had to remove several apples to have enough space.\nIn order to get rid of those apples, Furuya put them in a mixer and drank the blended apples. Since he was in a hurry to get rid of the apples, he did not remove the seeds before putting them into the blender. Conan pointed that further exams could detect the seeds, which would still be in the culprit's stomach, and Furuya surrendered. Shuuhei admitted to knowing the fruits in the treasure chest before every show.\n",
