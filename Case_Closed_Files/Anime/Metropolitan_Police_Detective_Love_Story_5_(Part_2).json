    "Situation": "Takagi and Sato are on a date at Tropical Land. Meanwhile, Shiratori, along with several other officers, are at the park in a surveillance van investigating a rumored drug deal involving a dealer in hiding named Asakichi Yakura. Shiratori also plans to intentionally interfere with Takagi's date. Shiratori has one of the officers bring the Detective Boys to the park and put them in Takagi and Sato's care. Takagi plans to present Sato with a ring inside his green backpack and discovers a bag of heroin inside. He realizes that he picked up the wrong backpack during the roller coaster ride. They return to the ride and learn from the attendant that no one returned asking for the backpack. Conan discerns the bag's owner was delivering the drugs without knowing what was inside, causing Sato to suspect Yakura's involvement. The backpack's strap reveals that the owner wore it on his left shoulder, suggesting he is left handed. They proceed to a photo-booth to examine the passengers who were with them on the roller coaster. Meanwhile, the officers misunderstand Sato's conversation, believing Kekkon (血痕?, lit. \"Bloodstain\") to mean Kekkon (結婚?, lit. \"Marriage\") and Heroin to mean Hirōen (披露宴?, lit. \"Reception\") which causes them to believe that Takagi proposed. This allures them to seek out Takagi's backpack with the ring. At the photo booth, the four suspects are a golfer, a baseball player, soccer player, and swimmer. The golfer's writing reveals him to be left handed due to the ink smearing to the right.\nThey confront the golfer and discover he is not the owner of the backpack.\n",
