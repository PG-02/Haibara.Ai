    "Situation": "With the intent of deliberating the conception of the stage drama utilizing Kogoro and Heiji as prototypes, Conan and the rest visit Kyoto, where the drama director resides. The producer, stage director, and screenwriter are also reunited. Heiji, after having a brief inspection of the screenplay, focused his attention on the fiancée of the main character who was based on Heiji. The fiancée, of course, was based on one of the individuals who tagged along: Momiji Ooka, who continues to claim that she is Heiji's fiancée. Heiji continues to scan through the screenplay, and he was convinced that the main character in the drama would have a wife. However, the self-proclaimed \"Heiji's fiancée\" has set a trap for Ran and Kazuha by providing a Kyoto Dessert Tour.\nAt the place where Kogoro's group is meeting, he and Heiji are shocked to learn that Kogoro takes the supporting roles for the main character, even though the script is almost consistent with the plagiarized sounding character names: Daigoro Mouri is played by Osamu Kenzaki and Heiichi Hattori is played by Hyoga Komoto respectively, while the character Heiichi will be engaged to will be played by Momiji Ooka. Then another director named Kyousuke Kabumoto comes in and explains the situation as to why the script had an engagement scene, and reveals another special guest who is Hyoue Kuroda. Meanwhile, Kazuha and Ran also understand this was Momiji's arrangement, with Iori reassuring that someone more trustworthy than him is also attending the event as well.\nRan and Kazuha are still struggling to stop Momiji's plan, meanwhile, outside the film crew building, the pizza delivery guy arrives and everyone starts to share their pizzas, except for Kabumoto because he's on a diet. While eating, Kuroda comments on the detail of the Japanese policeman bribing with... candy, because for him, bribing isn't just limited to money. Afterwards, Kabumoto decides to go to sleep since the sleeping pills he took have taken effect and asks everyone to wake him up 30-40 minutes later.\nAfter a while, after giving advice, Kuroda is about to leave because he has some works to do, but suddenly remembers something and asks everyone about an actress who committed suicide and had a close relationship with Kabumoto named Ninka Gyōda, there the colleagues mention the aftereffects of her suicide and the role she was supposed to play in this movie. However, when everyone is about to let Kuroda say goodbye to Kabumoto, they discovered that the door wouldn't open, just like the scene of Gyōda's suicide, at that time Conan and Heiji take the ladder that everyone mentions to enter the room through the window, with Kuroda (and later, Kogoro) also following and destroying the balcony door to enter the scene.\n\nInspector Ayanokoji, after arriving at the scene, recounts what has happened and begins questioning everyone about their actions at the time: Inaba was the one who opened the hallway door, but only partially, with Kimata confirming this; not to mention that he immediately recognized the piece of cloth as the shirt Kabumoto was wearing at the time; Karuo now felt worried about him, remembering the same thing that happened to Gyōda, so everyone decided to check on him through the window when they discovered the body. Ayanokoji concludes that this was a locked room scene and a suicide, but Conan and Heiji say that this was not a suicide because:\n- There was no spoon to put the powdered poison at the scene and there were no traces of poison on the bottle's seal if the powder had been poured into the bottle.\n- The inside of the bottle cap was dry because if you wanted to mix the powdered poison, you had to shake it well before drinking it.\nThat means everyone here will be suspects (except for Conan, apparently), first Heiji and Kogoro mentions that the victim's three co-workers went to the victim's room 15 minutes after he fell asleep, but in reality they came to check on the situation and didn't see the bottle of water or the poison that Heiji and Kogoro were implying. Next is the remaining group consisting of Kogoro, Kuroda, Conan, Heiji and Momiji, with Momiji claiming that she was with Heiji while hugging his arm, causing him to feel her big chest. Meanwhile Kazuha is seen worrying about Heiji but she and Ran couldn't go back right away because they still have to visit the shops following the original plan arranged by Momiji.\nAs for the poison, it was clear, but another question is what occasion caused Kabumoto to consume another sleeping pill because the type he used might not be effective enough for the killer to take advantage of and kill the victim. However, today, no one saw him consume coffee or pizza, not to mention he was very sensitive when it came to lollipops because he once was angry right after tasting the lollipop that the three of them had switched to tease him. Kuroda questioned whether he really didn't eat pizza because in addition to the smell of almonds, he could smell pizza in his mouth, even though he was abstaining; and asked about pets because he kept smelling a faint scent of wild animals, which startles Ayanokoji and makes him turn around and tell Maro to be patient in his pocket, with her agreeing that.\nMeanwhile, Ran and Kazuha, who have just arrived at the next restaurant, start to eat immediately, to the tour guide's surprise, while Iori is just looking around as if it was a habit, according to him. Back to the case, the three main suspects recall the time when Gyouda's suicide had a profound impact on Kabumoto, even causing the show that everyone is participating in today to not happen, but for some reason after looking at the lollipop he was eating. But speaking of it, Momiji remembers that one of the lollipops that Kogoro accidentally dropped bounced up and down without making a sound, thanks to which Heiji and Conan learned the true truth of the incident.\nConan and Heiji bought a pizza and a mysterious item that they assumed was used to create the locked room scene. However, while in the kitchen to perform the victim's trick of eating pizza, Momiji comes in and offers to cut the pizza with a knife in the kitchen cabinet, but she holds it upside down and trips over a nearby bag of rice, forcing Heiji to come to the rescue and accidentally creates another oh my gosh incident. Meanwhile, Kazuha and Ran have three more places to eat, but Kazuha realizes that she should enjoy the food instead of eating it quickly and apologizes to Ran, convinced that the trap wouldn't work on Heiji. Back in the kitchen, Conan has to remind the other two to return to the case so Heiji could escape the fate of losing his first kiss, but we probably won't forget that incident, right?\n",
    "People": "- 48 years old\n- Producer\n- 39 years old\n- Playwright\n- 50 years old\n- Stage director\n- Victim (poison)\n- 52 years old\n- Director\n- Deceased (poison)\n- Actress\n- Ran and Kazuha's tour guide\n- Pizza Kyo deliveryman\n- Mysterious old man using a breather\n- Mysterious middle-aged with sunglasses\n- Old man's driver\n",
    "Resolution": "Kabumoto often “gutted” the pizza by cutting a long, thin slice from the middle of the pizza so that no one would notice that the pizza had been stolen. Inaba knew about this habit, so he just sprinkled sleeping pills in the middle, and any kind of theft would inevitably result in consuming more sleeping pills.\nAs for the door, it wasn't actually stuck in the first place, but he had grabbed the doorknob and kicked it to fool everyone's hearing; the cloth was arranged by Inaba after he and his two colleagues went to check on Kabumoto. Things then progressed smoothly when Kimata noticed the cloth first and helped Inaba place a rubber ball between the door and the doorstop, causing it to actually get stuck, thus creating a locked room scene. To open that door, you just need to pull and push slowly and it will work.\nHowever, while everyone was trying to approach Kabumoto through the window, Inaba actually killed the victim and then hid the rubber ball as a lollipop. Ironically, because Kogoro carelessly dropped the lollipops on the table, Momiji realized that one of the lollipops was bouncing and didn't make a sound.\nThat afternoon, Kazuha and Ran's group have finally finished the unplanned buffet and are taken to Kabumoto's house, where the crime scene had taken place. When they get off the bus, they see the police car, Heiji and Inspector Ayanokoji, who is escorting Inaba to the station, and when Kazuha wants to ask Heiji about what had happened, Momiji butts in and talks about the case and that oh my gosh incident in a positive way. This of course makes Kazuha furious.\nMeanwhile, Iori keeps looking somewhere to see if he's being followed under Kuroda's notice, the two then start talking to each other while Conan listens in. From there we learn that Iori is a former police officer named Sakakibara and that his past still seems to be painful to him even now. Also Kuroda asks if he visited the blond guy, referring to Amuro, and he says yes and says that although he's still haunted by the past, it's not that bad. Suddenly, a car with two strange men, one of whom is on a respirator, insults that the police are just idiots.\n",
