    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan are invited to comedian Asako Fujimori's birthday party, even though Kogoro failed to find her stalker. When they arrive, they discover that Fujimori has stabbed a man in a zombie mask. They presume that the zombie is Fujimori's stalker, but discover that it is Jiro Imaoka, Fujimori's partner in her comedic career.\n\n",
    "People": "- 37 years old\n- Comedian\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- 28 years old\n- Comedian\n- 60 years old\n- Manager\n- Asako's ex-boyfriend (15 years ago)\n- Stalker and bully\n- Elementary school boy\n- Elementary school boy\n- Elementary school boy\n- Elementary school boy\n",
    "Resolution": "Conan's investigation leads him to believe Asako Fujimori made up the stalker in order to murder Imaoka. He tranquilizes Kogoro and reveals that Fujimori and Imaoka met at a nearby park, evidenced by the cockleburs, only found in this park since they are rare in Tokyo, found on Imaoka's clothes and Fujimori's shoes. Fujimori then pretended to lose her key and faked a heart attack forcing Imaoka to enter through the apartment's balcony to retrieve her heart medication. Fujimori, entered her apartment before Imaoka did and killed him. She then moved his corpse onto the carpet and put the mask on him.\nShe broke the window from the outside to make it realistic and purposefully injured herself with a bruise but it was done the wrong way since the handprint didn't correspond with Imaoka. Another proof is that glass shards were found inside the mask which proved she broke the window before putting the mask on Imaoka which Imaoka wouldn't do. The decisive piece of evidence is that the fruit punch she had made is in fact too sweet and icy proving that she cooled it before taking it out pretending she had been making the punch.\n"
