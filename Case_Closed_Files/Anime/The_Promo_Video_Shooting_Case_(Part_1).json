    "Situation": "Conan, Ran, Sonoko, and the Detective Boys are invited to an Okinawa Prefecture island for free diving lessons, but bad weather prevents them from doing so. While exploring the island, they find a filming crew lead and directed by Yuya Miyasaka, an actor who lost his fame due to assault causing the drama he starred in to cancel. While they watch, they see that Miyasaka physically harrases many of the crew members. It starts to rain soon after and every one returns to the resort, but Miyasaka is found murdered later on.\n\nThe resort staff, film crew excluding Miki Kitagawa, and Conan's company meet in the lobby to discuss the identity of the murderer. Due to the rooms having an automatic lock when closed, they conclude Miyasaka had let the perpetrator into his room and suspects it to be the work of one of the crew members. The main suspects are fellow actress Saeko Akimoto, assistant director Eiji Yamamoto, stunt double Mitsuo Okita and cameraman Shingo Takayama.\nKitagawa returns to the lobby and exclaims she saw Shingo Takayama, the cameraman, fleeing from the resort. Lead by Kitagawa, they find Takayama's body. He had fallen off a cliff.\n\nAfter investigating Miyasaka's body and the camera which recorded the first instance the body was found, Conan realizes who the culprit is.\n",
