    "Situation": "Kogoro and Conan walk past Beika Park and see Megure, Takagi, and Chiba along with witnesses on a canvassed area. They decide to look further into it.\n\n\n\n",
    "People": "- Victim (burned?)\n- 63 years old\n- Housewife\n- Former elementary school teacher\n- Victim (burned - survived)\n- 28 years old\n- Government office employee\n- Yasuko's eldest son\n- Deceased\n- Yasuko's husband\n- Yuichi and Eiji's father\n- Victim (beaten)\n- 23 years old\n- Unemployed\n- Yasuko's youngest son\n- 32 years old\n- Construction company worker\n- Yasuko's past student\n- Beika Business Hotel customer\n- Drunk lady\n- Beika Business Hotel bellboy\n- PM convenience store cashier\n- PM convenience store clerk\n- PM convenience store manager\n- Hinode Pier construction site supervisor\n- Rintaro's boss\n- Nebada Brewery bar employee\n- Tokyo Cruise Ship water taxi tourist\n- Tokyo Cruise Ship water taxi tourist\n- Tokyo Cruise Ship water taxi tourist\n- Tokyo Cruise Ship water taxi tourist\n",
    "Resolution": "- At 8:00 PM, Takase enters the bar but sits opposite to the customers so they don't see him;\n- At 9:00 PM, Takase's friend enters and pretends he wants to see someone. They change in the toilets and switch roles, his friend pretending to be the noisy Takase at the back of the store and him pretending to be the customer who hasn't found his drinking partner;\n- At around 9:40 PM, Takase arrives at Beika Park after a 30-minute walk and kills Eiji;\n- At around 10:10 PM, Takase comes back to the bar as the customer looking for his friend and changes back with the fake Takase who leaves the place saying to the waiter that he got the wrong date;\n- At 11:00 PM, Takase leaves the bar without being suspected of having left earlier.\n- Rintaro's friend and lookalike\nKogoro tells him that his motive is that Yasuko helped him in the past and that he thought he owed her because of it. He saw her at the hospital a few days ago and saw her injured so he wondered who could have done this to her since she was so careful. He learned from PM store's cashier and clerk that she was constantly abused by one her sons and he assumed that based on his mischievous personality, Eiji was the one. After learning about it, he took matters in his own hands to end it and that was why he killed Eiji. Although he doesn't have any evidence, Kogoro forces Takase into confessing as he reveals him the truth behind the fire. The sleeping detective reveals Yuichi Kadowaki was the real one behind the domestic abuse as confirmed by the fact that on the day Yasuko was at the hospital, Eiji was at the police station after he got arrested for having got into an argument with the bar owner which leaves only Yuichi as the one behind it. Eiji was in fact the protector. Yuichi had a grudge against her for having messed up his childhood and wanted to seek revenge by abusing her daily. The fire was also started by him because he accidentally killed her when he threw her to the wall after a fit of rage. Kogoro also adds that Inspector Megure called him to tell him that Yuichi confessed to it. Takase then kneels and feels sorry for what he has done because it led to his favorite teacher's death.\n\n",
