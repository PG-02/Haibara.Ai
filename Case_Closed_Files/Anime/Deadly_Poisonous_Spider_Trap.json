    "People": "- 32 years old\n- Beika Agriculture University assistant professor\n- Mitsuhiko's neighbor\n- 38 years old\n- Spider fan\n- 28 years old\n- Biology magazine reporter\n- Tooru's girlfriend\n- Victim (poison)\n- Beika Agriculture University professor\n",
    "Resolution": "The spider was already dead before the professor came into contact with it. It had been planted on a needle hidden in the phone receiver. When the victim answered the phone, he would think that he had been bitten by the poisonous spider. The anti-venom had been hidden beforehand, and when he couldn't find it, he panicked. Because of his weak heart, he had a heart attack and died.\n"
