    "Situation": "One day, Ayumi is sick. She takes a day off from school and while she naps, her mother nips out from their apartment to do some shopping. When Ayumi wakes up, she hears noises from the front door. Excitedly, she runs to the door to surprise her mother as she comes in, but when she peeks through the peep hole, she finds that it isn't her mother at all, but a strange man with a ponytail fiddling with the lock. Terrified, she runs for the phone and tries to call the police, but her fingers are too slow, and as the door handle turns, in a frenzy of motion, she dives for a hiding spot and drops the phone in the process.\nThe robber, disguised as a deliveryman, enters and immediately sees the phone lying on the floor. It's very suspicious, why would anyone with such a well-kept home, drop their phone on the ground and not bother to pick it up? And so, he stalks through the house, looking around for someone that could be hiding, and then he sees it. The sleeve of a yellow shirt caught outside of a closed closet, a hiding place cliched because it is so great for hiding people in. With a malicious smile, hoping to find the hiding one, he throws open the closet door and Ayumi is not in the aforementioned closet. He then turns back and starts searching other rooms, while Ayumi was still inside, hidden under the bed.\nShe relocates to a closet, to afford herself more materials to communicate a secret voiceless message to Conan and as Mitsuhiko and Genta discuss their plan to surprise visit Ayumi at her apartment, she alerts Conan through his Detective Boys' badge. They hear the Yaiba clock declaiming the date and time and then, using a clever system of taps, she communicates that she can't talk, nothing is wrong and she was essentially prank-walkie-talkie-ing them.\n\n\nEveryone is reassured, except for Conan. He thinks that prank-walkie-talkie-ing people is out of character for Ayumi and would be more of the kind of idiotic activity that Genta or Mitsuhiko would participate in. Haibara picks up on his worry for Ayumi, and she provides the key to the message that Ayumi was really communicating before being interrupted by Conan, who runs out of the classroom.\n",
    "People": "- Robber\n- Suspected of killing l'Escargot's owner\n- Resident of Ayumi's mansion\n- Deceased (stabbed)\n- Restaurant l'Escargot owner\n",
    "Resolution": "- Conclusion\nConan yells for the teacher to call the police and then runs out of the classroom for Ayumi's house. So much time has passed since her message to them, that he fears that the robber will soon be killing and leaving the apartment. He recalls that the murdering robber in the paper had only killed just before he left and so he calls under the guise of Professor Agasa and offers to return 5,000,000 yen. Thats five million yen. Or so the materialistic robber thinks, and filled with the lucre of the opportunity, he decides to wait for this \"old man\".\nTrue to form, Conan enters the apartment nonchalantly with a soccer ball and threatens the robber with it. Conan then kicks the ball very hard at the helmeted head of the robber. But, the head of the robber was helmeted! And so, the robber takes out his baton and tries to beat Conan. This time, the rest of the Detective Boys take the opportunity to take down the robber, Haibara spraying Fire Fighting Concentrate Foam into his eyes and then Mitsuhiko and Genta sitting on him.\n- Epilogue\n",
    "Trivia": "- Mrs. Yamamoto's room appears in Grabbing Karuta Cards in Dire Straits.\n- Ayumi lives on the 30th floor of the apartment building.\n"
