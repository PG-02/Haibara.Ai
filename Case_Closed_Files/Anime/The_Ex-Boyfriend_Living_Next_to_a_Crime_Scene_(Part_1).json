    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Conan and the Detective Boys run into Naeko Miike and Yumi Miyamoto, who were talking about Yumi's ex-boyfriend.\nNaeko Miike shortly receives a call from her acquaintance, Sakurako Yonehara, about a dead body. When the police arrive on the scene, the case seems to be a suicide, but Conan points out that the ripped-out suicide note does not match the ripped page of the victim's notebook. Also, the note is signed with the victim's full name, while all of her other notes were signed with only her first name. Thus, the case develops into a possible murder. And among the suspects is Yumi's ex-boyfriend Shukichi Haneda, who lives next door to the crime scene, because he know the code to the mail box where a spare keys is kept.\n\nConan pieces all the clues together: the suicide note with somewhat strange contents, Shukichi Haneda mentioning a \"well-prepared move\", same phone models of all the family members, the trick behind the bedroom door closing upon Sakurako and the victim's husband entering the room, and the victim's phone on the floor.\n",
    "People": "- 52 years old\n- Condo resident\n- Victim (hanged)\n- 52 years old\n- Naganobu's wife\n- 28 years old\n- Condo resident\n- Yumi Miyamoto's ex-boyfriend\n- 22 years old\n- Naganobu's son\n- 7 years old\n- Naganobu's niece\n- Apartment building housekeeper\n- Sakurako and Yumi's acquaintance\n- Tokyo MPD Police officer\n",
    "Resolution": "The note was in the victim's handwriting, but it was four years old from an incident, an almost fly crash, where she almost died, so it wasn't a suicide note, but a farewell note to her family. The handwriting was shaken because the plane was about to crash. She wrote her full name, so the authorities would know who wrote it and pass it on to her family. The note mentioned things, like that her niece could borrow a kimono to a seven-five-three celebration, but the niece who is now seven, was three four years ago. The note also mentions an 'injury' the victim caused her husband, and while the husband claimed it was a bruise to his face, the son revealed that four years ago just before the fly crash the victim accidentally broke her husband's foot. And as for the mention in the note of her son to study hard for his exam, it wasn't the drivers test she meant, but the test to get into the university four years ago. The husband came across the note by accident and after the argument, where he was hit it the face, he decided to use the circumstances to kill his wife, so it would match the note and the police would believe it to be a suicide note and close the case as a suicide.\n",
