Ryoji trips and falls, but the Detective Boys help him and accompany him to the house. The women keep treating Ryoji as a servant and order him to cook for them, while they go jogging, but a minutes later the boys hear a scream, and find that the women were hit by a car.\n\nThe women are delivered to the hospital in an ambulance. Meanwhile, Conan managed to follow the car that ran over the women, and the driver is a young lady. Conan follows the woman who arrives to Beika Hospital and talks to Ryoji, who is also there.
