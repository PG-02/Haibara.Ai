During lunch, the woman shows the kids two videos: one in which her husband is learning how to swim with the help of a kickboard and one in which the man has finally learned to swim. After a few hours, while playing the kids see the entrepreneur jump into the sea and drown.\n\n",

    "Resolution": "After that, Nao used a water-soluble polymer, which most likely rose the water density above 1.3, which is dense enough to easily float a person while they're  reading. After jumping into the ocean, he realized that he couldn't keep himself afloat properly and drowned as a result. Nao as shown in the video delayed the rescue attempt on purpose to ensure that he stayed in water enough for him to die.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The truck from Shirakabe Hotel named \"Hotel Delivery\" is an unknown Isuzu truck, with its license plate half visible: わ, 27-94 (Wa, 27-94).\n"
