    "Situation": "Ran, Sonoko, and Conan are at Tropical Land ice skating. A murder occurs in the women's bathroom and there are what appear to be two dying messages, an S smeared in blood and the victim's phone, which reveals the letters KIX when the redial function is pressed.\n\nThe murder trick is revealed.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (gunshot)\n- 27 years old\n- Company President's daughter\n- 29 years old\n- Banker\n- 28 years old\n- Office worker\n- 30 years old\n- Housewife\n- 29 years old\n- Firefighter\n- Deceased (suicide by gunshot)\n- Chihiro's previous boyfriend\n- Mother with child\n- Woman A's friend\n- Woman A's child\n",
    "Resolution": "",
    "Motive": "When confronted with this proof, the murderer confesses: she killed Chihiro for dating Narita then ruthlessly dumping him, driving him to suicide (but the other friends thought he'd simply had a fatal accident while cleaning his gun). Before he killed himself he called Izumi and in tears told her, Chihiro had told him that she had been two-timing with his best friend Kunitomo Oda. Oda reveals it was a misunderstanding and that Chihiro was lying about them having a relationship as the one he truly loves is Izumi herself telling her perhaps she killed the wrong person, leaving her stunned.\n",
    "Aftermath": "",
    "Differences between the manga and anime": "- Due to the brutal nature of the murder, the expression of Chihiro is changed to be more peaceful, and her eyes are closed, compared to the manga. This type of censorship would later be used in various cases, such as the innocent victim in Sonoko's Dangerous Summer Story, and is fully used from A Small Client onward in the anime with a small exception in Bathroom Where Ran Collapsed As Well due to plot reason.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The culprit's weapon is a Browning O/U Double Barreled Shotgun.\n- The name of four of the suspects and the person who died prior to the case are derived from airport names: Chihiro Itami (Osaka International Airport), Yoriko Komatsu (Komatsu Airport), Narita (Narita International Airport), Izumi Sano (Kansai International Airport), Yasuharu Misawa (Misawa Airport).\n",
