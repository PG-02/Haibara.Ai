    "Story": "Date, Matsuda, Hiro, and Rei are having a gathering at a restaurant with some female police academy students, which is held by Hagiwara. However, he is late. The women talk about the fact that Date already have girlfriend, while Matsuda don't. Meanwhile, Hiro and Rei are enjoying eating some food. Hiro says that even he could make it and will show Rei how, before mentioning that Rei don't know the first thing about cooking. Hearing that, one of the women want to try the food Rei made even if it is bad. Matsuda then join the conversation, saying that Rei's interest in women other than older lady doctors is zero. Another woman then jokingly threaten Matsuda that she will arrest him if he keep saying unkind things.\nLater, Hagiwara arrives. He tell the group that he was helping an old woman getting up the stairs, looking for her \"very lucky \"fortune, and bought her another \"very lucky\" fortune. The women are impressed by Hagiwara behavior, but Date feels that he is just lying. After eating, Hagiwara invites the woman to karaoke. On the way, a man appraoches Hiro. Turns out the man is the person Hagiwara helped before going to the restaurant. AFter the man leaves, Matsuda adds that Hagiwara doesn't lie about that kind of thing, although he use \"old woman\" instead, knowing that it would be received better.\nWhen looking back at the man, Hiro notice a girl. The girl resembles another girl from his childhood, who had passed away.\nThe next day, Hagiwara complains that his throat hurts after singing too much during the karaoke session. Suddenly, an RX-7 FD3S appears. The car stops and Onizuka appears from the driver seat. Hagiwara admire the car, and praise Onizuka to ride his favorite car. Onizuka then clarify that it is not his car. It belongs to a senior police detective who died on duty. He also says that four years ago, the daughter of the senior police detective declared that she will become a police officer, so Onizuka is taking care of the car till then. Onizuka then ask Hagiwara to park the car in the garage.\nHagiwara deduces that the daughter is cute, while Matsuda thinks that she is probably a stubborn tomboy. After Hagiwara drives away, Hiro ask Rei if he is interested to ride the car, as the car is also called \"Zero\". Rei quickly denies, saying that he is not into flashy car. However, Hiro could tell that he is into it.\nDuring Heavy Equipment Training, Hagiwara tell the others that his family runs an auto repair shop, and Matsuda used to visit the shop and got into trouble with disassembling and modding stuff wthout permission. Hagiwara then says that by the end, Matsuda made a research on explosive. Matsuda adds that he can tell how one is built by just looking at it. Hagiwara admits that he want to take over the shop, but whe the business was doing well, the economy suddenly collapsed, and the shop end up going bankrupt. He then decided to become a police, knowing that it will never go bankrupt.\nDuring Motorcycle Skill Training, Matsuda notice that the motorcycle Hagiwara is working on has problem on carburetor. He is not as fast as Matsuda, but in the end it is fixed. Suddenly, a man wearing sunglasses and black suit approaches both of them. He asks them if they are interested in joining the bomb disposal unit of the riot squad. Matsuda is excited and receives the offer, saying it loudly in front of the man. Meanwhile, Hagiwara wants to think about it for a while.\nLater, Rei knocks on Hiro's room, asking if he want to buy anything. However, there is no answer. Meanwhile, Hiro is going out with a serious face, while Date observes him from behind.\nIn the lounge, Hagiwara and Matsuda talks about the offer. It seems that Hagiwara is interested, but after what happened to his father's shop, he wonders if these are the gates to ruin. Matsuda then advices that he better turn down the offer, as bomb disposal is a serious business. When Matsuda seems to go elsewhere, Hagi asks if he is going to eat. Matsuda says that he was asked by Onizuka to check the engine of RX7 and wash the car, which makes him think to join the bomb disposal unit as soon as possible. Hagi then asks if the bomb disposal unit scares Matsuda. Matsuda replies that he would be lying if he says no, but he has been interested in the bomb squad for some time, and that he is all gas, no brakes.\nLater, Hiro is seen arriving at the bike shop where a man with a goblet tatto was seen. Date then approaches him, saying that he will let Hiro investigate things if he don't want to tell him. The worker still refuse to tell about the man. Tomori then appears and ask if Hiro is looking for Irie. Irie has a cup tatto on his left shoulder. He then show Hiro a group photo where Irie appeared in. Tomori then ask the reason why Hiro looking for a man with tattoo, as it is very common nowadays. There is a scorpion tattoo on the bike shop worker's neck, and Tomori has the goddess Kannon tatto on his upper left arm.\nSuddenly, there is aloud bang from outside, and a car is stuck on the back of a moving truck. Date and Hiro then chase the truck. Hiro tries to ask the driver to stop the truck. However, the truck driver suddenly passed out while the truck keep accelerating.\n",

    "Resolution": "Later, Hagi, Matsude and Rei arrive with the RX-7. First, Hagi tries to stop the truck by crashing into it. However, the weight difference is too big. Matsuda then have an idea using the police siren. He ask the stuck car's sunroof to be opened, then grab Rei's shirt. Hagi then proceed to do side wheelie, and use the police siren to jump into the air. While in the air, Matsuda and Rei jump to the car's sunroof opening. Matsuda detaches the car bumper, while Rei takes care of the truck driver.\nHiro then realizes that the road is not displyed in GPS. Date then realizes that the road comes to a gap. Matsuda finished removing the bumper's inner clips, and ask the driver to pull the hand brake, freeing the car from the truck. However, another problem is the truck that keep moving towards the gap. Hagi realizes that the truck will fall down as the braking distance is not enough. He then remembers Matsuda's phrase that he is all gas, no brakes. Hagi then quickly ask Rei to keep accelerating the truck.\nBoth the RX-7 and the truck jump through the gap. The RX-7 manages to reach the other road, but the truck barely manages to reach it. The front side of the truck crashes into the edge of the road. Fortunately, the force from the back side make the truck flip upside down, and land safely on the road. Hagiwara then realizes that hitting the gas once in a while is not a bad idea.\n",
