    "Situation": "After the confrontation with Black Organization, Jodie Starling offers Ai Haibara to join the Witness Protection Program, which allows Haibara to escape the Black Organization by faking her name and cutting ties with her friends.\nOne rainy on the way from school, Ayumi collides with an escaping phantom killer and she isn't able see the face of the killer, due to him  being concealed with a hat and hood. The phantom killer fells upon colliding with Ayumi and drops his knife he used for a recent slasher attack. Once the phantom killer gets up, he faced Ayumi and reaches out to her. Ayumi screams in fear of harm, but he only picks up a small object from the ground and then flees the scene afterwards. A clue is left behind when Ayumi realizes a mark on her hand that resembles a number 5.\n\nAyumi and the Detective Boys are taken to the police department to provide information regarding the phantom killer, but the only thing provided was that the phantom killer was a man through Ayumi hearing his voice, but that provided little help. With Detective Sato they all returned to the scene of the crime and found out the mark left on Ayumi was of a car brand. Genta was also found with the symbol on his butt from sitting on Detective Sato's car logo. With this added information, the culprit has been narrowed down to those with cars of the same mark.\nThe suspects have been narrowed to three people: Hiroshi Enomoto, Naokazu Fukuchi, and Toshiaki Degawa. Ayumi is willing to face the suspects to find out who is the phantom killer, but Haibara objects to that plan due to concern for Ayumi's safety. Haibara explains to her how the culprit would bear a grudge on her if she places the culprit in that kind of predicament and how he may also seek revenge if he is acquitted due to a lack of evidence. As a precaution, Ayumi and the others would instead watch the suspects from afar in a car with smoked glass to prevent such an outcome.\n",
    "People": "- 21 years old\n- Part-time sushi shop owner\n- 36 years old\n- Car mechanic\n- 43 years old\n- Lock shop owner\n- Victim (slashed - injured)\n- Civilian\n- Office worker\n- Witness\n- Man with bag\n- Tokyo MPD forensics officer\n",
    "Resolution": "Based on the testimonies, the Detective Boys realize that culprit is Naokazu Fukuchi.\n- Among the three suspects, Fukuchi's testimony contradicts with his actions at the time of murder: a unskilled driver would never test drive their car in a location full of people or on the day with poor visibility due to rain. In additional to that, he parked his car in an extremely close distance with the nearby car and did it very neatly, meaning that he is in fact a very good driver.\n- Despite the fact that the culprit might have disposed of the key, there would still be presence of blood in the keyhole, so Conan asked Takagi to bring in the forensics to perform a Luminol spray test. Though initially there was no reaction, Conan is able to sever the lock cylinder and reveal that the exterior of the keyhole was replaced by another one in order to remove the incriminating evidence.\n- Moreover, the police can check the key lock with the one near the wheel to confirm whether or not they belong to the same car. Additionally, Fukuchi is unlikely to have replaced the key hole near the steering wheel, which means that there must still be a bloodstain from his victim there from when he inserted his key to start up the car.\nFukuchi attempts to escape while pretending to let the police confirm the key lock, but is knocked out by Conan's dart. After intense interrogation, he reveals he was slashing random victims to become famous and gain attention, a change to his mundane life.\n",
