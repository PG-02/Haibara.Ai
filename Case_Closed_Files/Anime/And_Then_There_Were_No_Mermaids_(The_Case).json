    "Situation": "Conan, Heiji, Kogoro, Ran, and Kazuha visit the solitary Isle of Mermaids, in the high seas off Wakasa Bay, Fukui Prefecture, looking for Saori Kadowaki, who had sent a letter to Heiji asking them to save her from being killed by a mermaid. In secret Heiji confines to Conan that the letter was meant for Shinichi despite being send to Heiji's address. But when they try to look for Saori she has been reported missing. They decided to talk with Saori's childhood friend Kimie, who is the elder's great-granddaughter. Rokuro Fukuyama the fisherman is Toshimi's fiancé. Those two along with Naoko, a shop clerk, are also childhood friends with Saori. They don't seem concerned over Saori's disappearance, but that's because Saori often left home, when she had argued with her father. Every year on this island a festival is held where three people win the Dugong Arrow that is said to wield immortality to its carrier. Saori won one last year, but have lost it and had since been paranoid about being curse by mermaids up until her disappearance. Kimie offer Ran and Kazuha each a ticket to the lottery, since a couple called off, and promise to take them to Saori's house after the festival. During the festival Kazuha wins an arrow, which she receives along with Naoko and Saori's father Benzo. The festival is brought to a disastrous end when one of the winners is found dead hanging down the waterfall.\n\nConan and Heiji investigate the area and history of Mermaids Grave, a forest on mermaid island. They learn that an elder who is over 130 years old is a holder of the arrow and the head of the festival. Three years ago a warehouse got burned down and a half body was discovered missing its legs. The police from the coast said that the body was of a middle age woman, and concluded that it might have been a tourist, who snuck into the warehouse to look for a dugong arrow and accidently started the fire. The deceased was never identified. But rumors had been going around that it was a body of a mermaid. The year after the incident, the bones were buried on the island, but later moved into the forest on orders from the Elder due to grave robbers who had stolen bones from the grave. In myth it was believed that bones of a mermaid grant long life. It was that incident that made the Elder famous around the country. Naoko suggest that Toshimi had been looking for the grave, and Kimie confirms that Toshimi often spoke of it. While investigating two more murders occur. First Naoko being strangled and her arrow is missing. The only connection between the three women, beside being childhood friends, is that they all three believed in the power of the arrow, and that the Elder was immortal. Heiji and Conan decides to take a look at the book with the names and numbers for those who anticipated in the festival's lottery, but the most recent one is missing. While Kimie goes out to search for it. Heiji and Conan takes a look at the old ones. Conan finds a name, Shiho Miyano, and remembers that it was Haibara's real name, but doubts that's her. Then Kimie gets burned in the warehouse near the shrine. After the corpse's identity is determent by dental records, Rokuro breaks down crying and the 'Elder' takes to her bed muttering about seeing young life dying, while she still lives. The group splits up, Heiji and Kazuha goes out searching for Benzo, while Rokuro takes the rest to Saori's house, so Ran can see a picture of Saori and determent if she was the woman, she and Kazuha saw. After searching a bag for travel in the house Conan realizes that something is missing. He reveals to Heiji he knows who the murderer is, relay his theory, and asks him to meet up later, but later Heiji and Kazuha fall off a cliff after they discovered the much-talked-about grave. At the grave Heiji sees that someone has visited it recently and begins to wonder if Conan's solution was correct.\n\n\n\nHeiji saves Kazuha and they're still having trouble. While everyone is waiting for the deduction of Sleeping Kogoro, Ran arrives with Lady Mikoto, to the chock of the island's elder citizens. Sleeping Kogoro is now going to present a deduction.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (strangled)\n- 28 years old\n- Saori's childhood friend\n- Souvenir shop clerk\n- Victim (burned)\n- 27 years old\n- Birth date: June 17, 1974\n- Saori's childhood friend\n- Bikuni Shrine maiden\n- 27 years old\n- Souvenir shop clerk\n- Missing\n- Victim (hanged)\n- 27 years old\n- Saori's childhood friend\n- 28 years old\n- Saori's childhood friend\n- Fisherman\n- 130 years old\n- Kimie's great-grandmother\n- Island's elder\n- 52 years old\n- Saori's father\n- Fisherman\n- Deceased (burned or suffocated)\n- Buried in Bikuni's forest\n- Inspector from Fukui Prefectural Police\n- Toshimi's father\n- Fishing union head\n- Deceased (drowned)\n- Kimie's mother\n- Souvenir shop owner\n- Saori's boss\n- Bikuni town deputy mayor\n",
    "Resolution": "- Benzo sold an arrow to a couple for one million yen.\n- Rokuro doesn't have feelings for Toshimi but for Kimie.\n- A swimming ring is found at the end of the Mermaid Falls.\n- On Naoko's body are several fish scales and her arrow is nowhere to be found.\n- The only thing that was able to identify that the burned body as Kimie is her dental record from three days ago, the same day that Saori disappeared.\n- The notebook that shows the festival’s participant numbers was stolen by someone.\n- Saori's \"something\" is nowhere to be found.\n- Saori and Kimie both got awards for best director and makeup artist respectively.\n- Heiji and Kazuha found the mermaid's grave on the mountain but the two of them fell off the cliff.\n- Benzo was caught, but his only crime is that he stole the arrow from his daughter. He found Toshimi's number from the end of Mermaid Falls and the reason that he stole the notebook is because he didn't want the police to think he killed Toshimi for her number. Also, Naoko doesn't trust him so there is no way for him to call her to the fishing net and that his target doesn't have to be Naoko, it could be Kazuha if he just wanted to steal the arrow.\n- Despite having motive for killing Toshimi, Rokuro has no motive at all to murder Kimie. Also he doesn't need a swimming ring to murder her.\n\nConan reveals that the murderer is Mikoto Shimabukuro. He then reveals the rumor of Mikoto being 130-years-old is a lie and that the \"Elder\" is just a fictional identity assumed by the Shimabukuro lineage to continue the tradition of the Dugong Arrow festival. The elder's true identity is Kimie Shimabukuro, the only one capable of pulling off a disguise as she used to work as a cosmetic artist. She was able to move around at such a restricted height by attaching roller blade wheel guards to her calves.\nKimie's mother who was the previous \"Elder\" has moved in the same way and only half of her corpse was found because the bones of her lower body easily destroyed because she had died with her legs bound to shorten her height. She had used the accident on the sea, where her husband, Kimie's father, died, to make her 'death' official and to become the Elder full time.\nKimie then faked her death and the burnt corpse they found in the warehouse was actually Saori Kadowaki, who was already murdered a long time ago. Kimie fooled the authorities by tampering with Saori's denture records. Saori was the one who was treated by the dentist, but on way to the mainland, Kimie stole Saori health card; With it lost, Saori had no other choice than to borrow Kimie's card and be treated in Kimie's name. The scene where Kimie's voice was heard in front of the elder was just a tape recording she played in advance. She killed Ebihara by chloroforming her and placing her on a dinghy with her neck tied to a shore rock with a rope. The current would drive Ebihara off the falls and effectively hang her. Kimie established an alibi for Naoko's murder by disguising herself as the missing Saori Kadowaki, not long after they returned to the island after having gone to the dentist.\nKimie's motive for the murders was revenge. When Saori, Naoko, and Toshimi failed to win the Dugong Arrow lottery when her mother assumed the \"Elder\" title, they got drunk and burned her alive in one of the warehouses to see if the Elder was truly immortal.\n\nWhen the women saw the Elder appearing unharmed (which was Kimie who took over the role), they became convinced that the Elder was immortal and her body was that of a mermaid, who she had supposedly ate flesh of. The reason Kimie didn't came forward after the fire and reveal who the body was, was because her mother's last wish had been that the existence of the 'Elder' should continue for the island.\nKimie herself discovered her mother's killers when Saori suffered a psychotic breakdown during a conversation between the two of them. In the middle of her sanity slippage, Saori asked Kimie for either a new arrow or the location of the 'mermaid's' grave, revealing that she had known that the 'Elder' had been inside the warehouse when it caught fire, and unknowingly insulting the dead Mrs. Shimabukuro. And since Naoko and Toshimi too were convinced of the Elder's power and that the body was of a mermaid, Kimie guessed that they too had been involved. After killing Saori, Kimie lured Naoko and Toshimi out, telling them that if they won an arrow at the festival, she would tell them the location of the grave.\nKimie continued the \"Elder\" tradition for her mother, but Heiji wounded but alive reveals that all the middle aged denizens of the isle knew her secret and that the half demolished mermaid corpse was her mother. After the fire they had considered ending the festival, but when they realized that Kimie was going to continue the myth of the Elder, they decided to support her from behind, as it was their duty. So all the town people bowed their heads and apologized for not telling her sooner.\nKimie cries due to her guilt ask why they did not tell her anything. Heiji states that she should have awoken from a nightmare to an extended life, he stated that life is short, will be appreciated, and to live their life to fullest. He asks an unconscious Kazuha if he is right.\nThe next morning, Kimie was taken away by the police and local residents came to say goodbye to her. As the large waves stop the police boat from leaving, Conan noted that it was as if the sea were trying to prevent her from leaving and that Kimie, who became the \"Elder\" three years ago, supported the island until the final night afterward.\nRan asks Heiji to show her the stab wound that Kazuha placed with love causing Kazuha to be embarrassed. Heiji told Ran that it healed and was already gone. When Kazuha checked, she said she should have made the wound much deeper if she had known that he would’ve recover that quickly but does not care about it since the arrow had gotten people killed and was not worried. Heiji in his thoughts stated that she was naive and he would never let her get hurt in which Conan noticed that Heiji's injury was on his other hand.\nHeiji realized that the crying woman from his phone call to Saori was Kimie. She most likely had just killed Saori and was pretending to be her.\nIt turns out that it was Yukiko and Takayoshi from the murdered diplomat case who recommended Shinichi to Saori. Yukiko grew up on the island, and had been Saori's neighbor. The reason that Saori send her letter to Shinichi to Heiji's address was probably because Yukiko told Saori that the two detectives know each other. Saori might have hoped that Heiji would pass on the letter to Shinichi.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga when Kimie is removing her mask, she takes it off easily unlike in the anime where she removed the mask slowly for dramatic effect.\n",
