    "Story": "The story takes place several years ago at the Metropolitan Police Department Police Academy. One night, Rei Furuya and Jinpei Matsuda are having a duel. They punch each other at the yard. Matsuda hates Amuro, who \"really wants to become a police officer\". That night, Hiromitsu Morofushi has a nightmare about his parents' death when he was a child.\n\nHe is later awoken by a sudden knock on the door, finding an injured Rei, who is asking for some band-aids.\nThe next day, all students gather at the yard. Kenji Hagiwara, Hiromitsu Morofushi, Rei Furuya, Jinpei Matsuda, and Wataru Date are in the same class. Their instructor is Hachizo Onizuka. When Onizuka asks why Rei and Jinpei are injured, Date reasoned that they are too excited when they tried to catch some cockroaches. As a self punishment, Date instructs the class to run an extra lap. Onizuka can't manage to talk more with them as they start running.\nAnother instructor comments that Onizuka has taken five troublesome students. Rei who always getting into fights with other students, Hiromitsu who is traumatized by his parents' death, Date who can't let go of his father retirement from the police force, Kenji who has good communication skill but only uses them to attract women, and Matsuda who has outrageous behaviour and lack of cooperativeness.\nLecture begins, and Rei is able to answer Onizuka's question perfectly. Matsuda then wonders if the academy gradautes are capable of gathering information. Onizuka gets angry and ask Matsuda what he thinks the police are. He answers correctly, so Onizuka just lets him go.\nDuring lunch break, Rei asks Matsuda about his attitude change during class. Suddenly, some other student bumped with Rei, saying that someone should not be blond at a police academy.\nLater, Hiro tells Rei that Hagiwara told him about Matsuda's past. Matsuda's father, Jotaro Matsuda, witnessed a scuffle, but because he had an important match, he decided not to get involved. However, one of them is found dead, and another witness claimed that he saw Jotaro around the crime scene, so he was arrested. The true culprit was later arrested and Jotaro was cleared from charges, but his important matches was called off. He quits boxing and becomes an alcoholic. However, Hagiwara does not know why Matsuda decided to join police academy. After hearing the story, Rei decide to head to the next class, but Hiromitsu decide to stay longer. Turns out he is secretly try to investigate about his parents' murder case.\nThey later go to their shooting class. Rei successfully shoot on target five times, but Onizuka reminds him that there is always someone better than him. He then tells a story about a man who fired 20 shots right into the middle, but later quit the police force and runs a detective agency in Beika. When Matsuda tried to shoot the target, he feels that a part of the gun is broken. He then decide to dissasemble the gun, which angers Onizuka. Onizuka decides to cancel the class.\nLater, they find out that one bullet is missing. Onizuka accuses Matsuda as the one who stole the bullet. Onizka then asks Date to convince Matsuda to turn in the bullet, while he checks the roof repairs. Date knows that Matsuda is innocent, and plans to find the true culprit.\nSuddenly, a worker falls down from the roof. Onizuka tries to save him, but he gets strangled by the rope. The whole class starts panicking, except the five people, who are the only ones who know what to do.\n",
