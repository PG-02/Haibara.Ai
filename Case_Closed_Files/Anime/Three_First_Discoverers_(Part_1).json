    "Trivia": "- Lum Invader, a character from the external manga series Urusei Yatsura by Rumiko Takahashi, is a pun on the similar sounding of the names \"Lum\" and \"Rum\" due to the Japanese pronounciation of the Katakana syllable \"ラ\" (\"ra\") used in both. In the Japanese original, Haibara adds the word \"-datcha\", which is a famous speech affection used by Lum.\n- Incidentally, Fumi Hirano, Lum's voice actress in the anime version, previously performed the role of Reiko Shimizu in The Private Eyes' Requiem\n- She later voiced Rumi Wakasa, one of Rum's potential true identities.\n- The name of the suspects come from different brands of rums[1]:\nMamoru Gan'no (雁野 守) comes from Captain Morgan (キャプテン・モルガン ,Kyaputan Morugan?);\nYasue Komai (駒井 保江) comes from Myer's (マイヤーズ ,Maiyāzu?);\nDenji Shibakaru (柴苅 殿治) comes from Bacardi (バカルディ ,Bakarudi?);\nRonpei Sakaba (阪場 論平) comes from Ron Zacapa Centenario (ロン・サカパ・センテナリオ ,Ron Sakapa Sentenario?);\nKuramichi Habanaka (幅中 倉道) comes from Havana Club (ハバナ・クラブ ,Habana Kurabu?).\n- Mamoru Gan'no (雁野 守) comes from Captain Morgan (キャプテン・モルガン ,Kyaputan Morugan?);\n- Yasue Komai (駒井 保江) comes from Myer's (マイヤーズ ,Maiyāzu?);\n- Denji Shibakaru (柴苅 殿治) comes from Bacardi (バカルディ ,Bakarudi?);\n- Ronpei Sakaba (阪場 論平) comes from Ron Zacapa Centenario (ロン・サカパ・センテナリオ ,Ron Sakapa Sentenario?);\n- Kuramichi Habanaka (幅中 倉道) comes from Havana Club (ハバナ・クラブ ,Habana Kurabu?).\n- Mamoru Gan'no (雁野 守) comes from Captain Morgan (キャプテン・モルガン ,Kyaputan Morugan?);\n- Yasue Komai (駒井 保江) comes from Myer's (マイヤーズ ,Maiyāzu?);\n- Denji Shibakaru (柴苅 殿治) comes from Bacardi (バカルディ ,Bakarudi?);\n- Ronpei Sakaba (阪場 論平) comes from Ron Zacapa Centenario (ロン・サカパ・センテナリオ ,Ron Sakapa Sentenario?);\n- Kuramichi Habanaka (幅中 倉道) comes from Havana Club (ハバナ・クラブ ,Habana Kurabu?).\n",
