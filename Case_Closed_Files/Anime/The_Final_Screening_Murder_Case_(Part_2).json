    "Situation": "The Detective Boys attend the final opening day of a theatre as it is about to be demolished. They plan to watch three films of Gomera, a parody of Godzilla. During the second film, the man who bought and planned the demolishing of the theatre is found hanged.\n\nThe four suspects are the theatre clerk, a photographer, theatre manager, and projector technician. The episode ends with Mitsuhiko proclaiming he saw the theatre clerk looking at herself in the mirror.\nThe clerk went to fix her contact lenses. Takagi comes in explaining that the Victim owed a large sum of money. Agasa comes by to pick up the children, but Ayumi, Haibara, and Conan were still inside with the girls going to the bathroom while Conan walked around. Conan comes to an conclusion while looking in the bathroom mirror after Haibara parted some words, he runs into the theater and finds a clue in the pile of cigarettes' where Haruta was sitting as well as a footprint. Conan goes to Agasa and explains what he has discovered, though it is never said to the viewer. When Conan goes to whisper to Agasa the kids come in saying how rude he is (how about how rude they are for eavesdropping?) Tagaki tells Megure about what Haruta's neighbors had to say, that he was in a bad mood because of his debts and that he was arguing with the bank. Its revealed that the theater hasn't been sold yet. As the suspects keep saying that it was a suicide, the lights go dark and Agasa appears in the window, having repeated the 'trick the murderer has conspired today'.\n",
    "People": "- 21 years old\n- College student\n- 23 years old\n- Concession manager\n- 62 years old\n- Theater owner\n- Victim (hanged)\n- 43 years old\n- Real-estate agent\n- 39 years old\n- Projectionist\n",
    "Resolution": "After that, he began the mirror illusion trick. He used mirrors so that the light coming from the left window, which was where he hung the victim, would instead be projected from the right window. In this way, he could hang the corpse and play the movie from the other window. Moreover, he wouldn't need to cut the film and be in the projection room while the shadow appeared. After setting that mirror illusion, he went down to the theater, killed Seiji, and hung him in front of the left window while the movie was playing from the other window. Then, he went back to the projection room and removed the mirrors so that the light will flash through the left window and since the corpse is blocking the window, a shadow of it will be casted on the theater screen.\nThat way, even when the shadow appeared, he and Yuriko would be in the same room together and would sustain his alibi. The evidence is in Toshiyuki‘s camera. Toshiyuki captured the scene in which the shadow appeared. From there, they realized that the focus is wrong. That's because when Minoru moved the mirror back to the original window, the reflections will cause the scene to blur. All theater's projection machines fit the screen perfectly. Since they are supposed to fit the screen, it takes a lot of time for him to fix the focus and make it perfect in both ways, but no matter how hard he tried, there was no way for it to happen. He wasn't able to avoid the shaky part either. Yuriko went to the bathroom because there wasn’t any mirror in the projection room.\n",
