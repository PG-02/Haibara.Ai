    "Situation": "Ran, Sonoko, and Conan run into their old third grade teacher, Akiko Yonehara, who invites them to spend the night at a Nagano Prefecture mountain villa with her co-workers, who are taking a small weekend trip. A mysterious journalist arrives and tells them that a massacre similar to three years before will happen that night, and true to the man's words, people are attacked with different results. Can Conan help find the clues before too much damage occurs?\n\n\n\nConan is unable to figure out how a piece of rope disappeared, but when he figures out who is wearing something VERY special in his/her person, he realizes that the person has killed two people on the same night. Using Ran to reveal the secret by using his own voice, Shinichi reveals the information to everyone present, but the revelation will shock everyone involved, especially Ran and Sonoko.\n\nWith Agasa's help, and right before making the big revelation, Conan is able to get very important information about a certain \"Minako\" person.\n\n",
    "People": "- Victim (beaten - injured)\n- 30 years old\n- Haido Elementary School teacher\n- Former Teitan Elementary School teacher\n- Victim (strangled)\n- 30 years old\n- Haido Elementary School teacher\n- 29 years old\n- Haido Elementary School P.E. teacher\n- 27 years old\n- Haido Elementary School nurse\n- Victim (strangled)\n- Haido Elementary School music teacher\n- 37 years old\n- Newspaper reporter\n- Deceased (hanged)\n- 12 years old (3 years ago)\n- Haido Elementary School student\n- Man living in Nagano mountains\n",
    "Resolution": "Knowing the identity of only one of Minako's two murderers, Yonehara organized the trip to gather the teachers that she knew Minako looked up to. She first killed Sugiyama and left his body hidden outside the lodge to freeze and trick people in regards to the time of his death. Later, she attacked Sonoko to have an alibi, then immediately afterwards pretended to be a victim as well (using Sugiyama's body to such effects, that's the \"Yonehara\" Sonoko actually saw before being attacked), and used her lipstick to spell out Minako's name in all of these cases. Shimoda's panicked reaction upon realizing the last detail revealed his involvement to her, so she tricked him into meeting up with her and killed him as well.\nThe murder weapon was Yonehara's wig: she had cut her hair too short for her liking a while ago and hid it via a very long wig, and then decided to use it to strangle her victims by braiding it, excluding Sonoko as seen in the picture, without leaving clues. Ran says that there were small bloody scratches on the dead Shimoda's neck, and that there are some droplets of his blood in the wig.\nSeeing that she’s been uncovered, Yonehara takes off the wig. She admits her responsibility for the crimes and says she couldn't forgive those teachers who betrayed their students and even killed one of them, but then she adds she's not one to talk because she harmed Sonoko to make her trick work.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- The reason why Conan refrains from knocking out Ran is due to her nearly finding out his identity in The Cornered Famous Detective! Two Big Murder Cases. The anime omits this reason as it places the two stories in a different order.\n",
    "Translation changes": "",
    "Anime": "- The names of the characters in the Funimation Dub are:\n- Akiko Yonehara - Anne Preston\n- Kohei Shimoda - Paul Keen\n- Ryuichi Sakai - Brett Shore\n- Minori Nakamura - Shelly Tilton\n- Sugiyama - Larry Sullivan\n- Atsushi Mori - Drake Ziegman\n- Minako Mochizuki - Moreen Manahan\n- The characters that the culprit wrote on the victim’s hands were changed to be Mass-Acre-Night, spelling out massacre night which in turn was the reason Paul Keen (Kohei Shimoda) had been intimidated.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The Nagano Prefecture snow mountains reappear in Ara lodge from Magic Lover's Murder Case. Open spoiler box to see images.\n- This is the first case Ran solves, though technically it was Conan using his voice changing bow tie to help her as Shinichi. This would happen again later in the series.\n",
