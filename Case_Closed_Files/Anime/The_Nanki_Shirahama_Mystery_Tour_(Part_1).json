    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan go to Shirahama, Wakayama Prefecture, on a vacation they won, and there meet a group of medical college students and introduced themselves as Maki Shinjou, Tatsuhiko Yura, Madoka Mitsui, Kanako Miyahara, and Kouta Fuji. They are all in the same art club, but don't seem to get along well. The next day, Conan sensing a diabolical presence. When Madoka is drawing, she finds the body of one of her fellow students, Maki, stabbed in the heart.\n\nBecause three out four suspects each has an airtight alibi during the time of the murder: Yura was at Shirahama, Kanaka was at Engetsuto, and Fuji was at Adventure World, the suspicion falls on Madoka who was the first discoverer.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (stabbed)\n- 21 years old\n- Naniwa Medical School 4th year student\n- 21 years old\n- Naniwa Medical School 4th year student\n- 21 years old\n- Naniwa Medical School 4th year student\n- 21 years old\n- Naniwa Medical School 4th year student\n- 21 years old\n- Naniwa Medical School 4th year student\n- 35 years old\n- Detective from Wakayama Prefecture Police\n- 29 years old\n- Detective from Shirahama Eastern Police\n",
    "Resolution": "- Fuji's hand has a stamp given by the staff for the visitors that want to temporary leave Adventure World, something that shouldn't be there given that he was supposed to be at the location the entire day. More over, his camera contains a photo of a member of the staff in the dolphin show that didn't perform on that day, as well as lacking any additional photo for the entire two hours before the discovery of Maki's body.\n- The reason that Fuji had to temporary leave Adventure World was because he went to buy Suppa-kun, a keyholder from Shirahama Station that Madoka likes but Yura didn't buy for her, and rushed to Sandanbeki where Madoka was.\n- Fuji was the one who was informed of the murder first by Madoka, instead of the more logical choice: her boyfriend Yura.\nHowever, neither of them had committed the murder, as the true murderer is Kanako Miyahara. Originally, Maki was planning to kill Madoka because she stole her boyfriend, evidenced by a pairs of gloves found in her coat's pocket. Because she was the only one with a clear motive for the murder, Maki had Kanako disguise as her and head to the Shirahama Station at the same time as Kogoro, Ran, and Conan would be returning from Toretore Market and on their way to Adventure World: this would give her an alibi during the time of the murder. However, Kanako double crossed Maki and killed her instead.\nKanako's actions on the day are in this order.\n- First, after Maki had dropped everyone off at their designated location, she returned to Engetsuto to pick up Kanako. The two then headed toward Sandanbeki with Kanako disguising as Maki while inside the car.\n- Later, as Maki was sneaking through the forest toward Madoka, Kanako followed her and stabbed her with her own knife. Afterward, she collected Maki's knife and purse to disguise the crime as robbery.\n- Following up with the original plan, Kanako drove the van to Shirahama Station and appeared in front of Kogoro, Ran, and Conan, in order to shift the time of death by an hour. After that, she quickly drove toward Sanzo Shrine, disposing the disguise, money, and knife along the way, dropping the purse and van off at Sanzo Shrine, and rushed back to Engetsuto to create an alibi for herself. She also repeatedly called Maki's phone in order for Madoka to discover her body as fast as possible.\n- In a rush, however, Kanako forgot to wipe out all the trace of Maki's unique Parisian lipstick from her lip, and there should still be a remnant of her saliva on the lipstick itself, proving that she had been disguised as Maki. Additionally, because the culprit uncharacteristically took only the van key instead of the entire set, Conan deduces that Maki was the one who removed the van key herself and gave it to Kanako.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Maki Shinjou's car is a 2000 silver Toyota Estima (Second generation).\n- The bus is a 1985 Hino Blue Ribbon [P-HT235BA].\n- The taxi is a Honda Accord.\n- The real world locations spotlighted in this case are, in order of appearance: Shirahama Station on the JR Kinokuni Line, Minakata Kumagusu Museum, Shirarahama Beach, Sandanbeki Cliff, Senjoujiki Rock Plateau, Adventure World, and Toretore Ichiba. This case also features the fictional former site of the Marine Palace.\n",
