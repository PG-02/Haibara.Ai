    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan are invited to stay at a mansion by Beniko Suo, the hostess of a car accident charity, in North Shinjuku forest. While driving, they find a message from the Phantom of the Cursed Masks, who tells them they should not go the place. Once there, they find other famous celebrities: a baseball player, a prophet, a rockstar, and a photographer who lost his wife in a \"Hit and Run\" incident. The mansion is huge and divided into east and west sides, with the twin sisters Minaho and Honami Shimogasa taking care of each wings, and the only room connecting the two sides is the mask room. The mask room is locked at midnight each night due to Beniko's collection of Julio González's masks, a collection of 200 masks that are believed to be cursed. They were created by a famous man who lost everything and became engrossed in his masks; once he created 200 of them, he was found dead in his room surrounded with bloody masks. People who have owned his masks have suffered tragic fates. Suo, who now owns all 200 masks, had a priest place a seal on the curse, but the room is locked at midnight to prevent the masks from wandering. During their stay, Suo is murdered in a locked room, with Shobel's masks surrounding her and a dagger in her throat.\n\nSince the victim's room is in the west-wing of the mansion, it is originally deduced that the culprit is among the guests who stayed on that side. However, the question still remains: how did the 200 masks got into the locked room?\n",
