    "Situation": "When a body is discovered in a bonfire at a ritual Fire Festival by a tourist, the murder investigation begins.\n\nAnd when Kogoro finds out that the victim is the same man that he had been tailing for the past three days, he realizes that he has been had. The man who hired detective Mouri uses his testimony to create the perfect alibi. But Kogoro is sure that his client is the guilty one, and Conan agrees. Can Conan crack the case before this prime suspect leaves the country or will he get away with murder?\n",
    "People": "- Victim (burned)\n- 42 years old\n- Birth date: August 15, 1954\n- 42 years old\n- Company president\n- Negishi's friend\n",
    "Resolution": "Negishi really died on Tuesday night, the night before Yutaka left on his vacation in Kyushu. The next day, Yutaka had Kogoro follow a fake who looked like Negishi in order to make him think Negishi was alive through Wednesday night. Negishi is right-handed but the man on the photos is left-handed. This is the proof that the person Kogoro stalked is not Negishi but a different person.\nNegishi's body was found on Thursday evening, during the famous fire festival. Yutaka carefully checked ahead of time to make sure the times matched. With the body burned by flames, it was impossible to find the exact time of death. This led to Kogoro to think that Negishi died from Wednesday night to Thursday night, when in fact, he really died on Tuesday evening. Then, Yutaka came back from his trip on Friday night acting innocent with his complete alibi. Kogoro is completely infuriated when he realizes that he had been lied to, but he can only prove that Yutaka tricked him into following a double, NOT that he is the criminal.\nYutaka's plan is to escape the country, going to Seattle, taking Negishi's money with him. Fortunately, Conan confronts him for the murder before he escapes on an airplane and Conan manages to trick him and record him admitting the crime.\n\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "The manga version of the story sets up Conan being in school, as well as introducing his newly created Power-Enhancing Kick Shoes, which he tries while playing soccer while at the grade school soccer field. Additionally, this case takes place much, much earlier in the manga, being the fourth case in the series.\n",
