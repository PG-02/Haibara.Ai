    "Situation": "Eri Kisaki is the attorney for a man named Shinji Usami who is convicted for the murder of Tsuyoshi Hirasawa while in a drunken state.\n\nThe authenticity is doubted due to the fact Hirasawa murdered Shinji's son five years ago, but was not convicted because the murder was done while he was drunk.\n\nEri attempts to confirm Usami's alibi through his estranged wife Masako Kameda. Kameda reveals that Hiraswa visited her bar and that Kogoro should be able to confirm it. Kogoro reveals that he fell asleep at the bar, and was waken by Kameda who told him he had a phone call; The time on the phone proves that Usami was at the bar at the time of the murder. During the hearing, the prosecutor Reiko Kujo points to that fact that Kameda could have changed the time on Kogoro's phone to establish an alibi for her ex-husband. Kameda confesses to changing the time on Kogoro's phone and thus destroys Usami's alibi.\nAfter Kogoro was turned unwittingly from the defendant's witness to the prosecutor's witness Kogoro conducts his own investigation and investigates Usami's home while accompanied by Conan.\n",
