    "Situation": "Manda, a well known author, is greeted by his editor who needs his manuscript. He tells him that he is almost done and the editor goes and waits in the hotel hallway. Manda sneaks by in a disguise and goes to Haramoto's house, a man who has been ghost writing for Manda. Haramoto gives Manda the script and then tells him about a new mystery he is planning to unveil once Manda introduces him to the right people. Manda kills Haramoto with a vase and steals the detective story before returning to his hotel room.\n\nGenta hits a baseball through the window of Haramoto's house and breaks a vase. They go inside to apologize and find Haramoto dead. Conan realizes that the victim must have known the killer, and Manda is acting suspicious especially when he interrupts the housekeeper when she mentions the mystery Haramoto was working on.\n",
