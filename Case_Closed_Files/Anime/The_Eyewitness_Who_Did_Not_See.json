    "Situation": "Kogoro enters a barber shop and rests in a chair with a towel over his face. A few minutes later, a statue breaks and the owner, Ebihara, is found dead with a poisoned dart through his heart.\n\nConan investigates and realizes who the murderer is.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (poison)\n- Barber shop owner\n- 43 years old\n- Clock shop owner\n- 28 years old\n- Linen services employee\n- 45 years old\n- Pharmacist\n",
    "Resolution": "- Conclusion\nHe tranquilizes Kogoro to reveal that Masao Noda, the man who slept in the chair beside him before the murder. Conan reveals that Masao Noda had murdered Ebihara beforehand and explains Ebihara was the man in the chair when Kogoro entered the shop. Noda, disguised as Ebihara, was the one who invited Kogoro to the barber shop and covered his face with a towel. Noda then switched places with Ebihara and used an aimed dart to knock down some pottery to catch Kogoro's attention. As evidence, Conan reveals that Noda should have the same shirt as Ebihara. Takagi then proceeds to take off Noda's coat so he unbuckle it to show that there is only a blue sweatshirt under. Kogoro explains it's a childish trick that is to revert the clothes and that the logo should be on the other side which meant that if we had found it, only the culprit would've needed to do it. Takagi takes off Noda's coat resulting in a struggle pushing Noda on the ground and showing the other side of his shirt written Darts Hearts. Noda confesses and reveals that Ebihara sold him to loan sharks which made his wife worry and commit suicide.\n",
    "Aftermath": "",
    "Trivia": "- During the scene where Masao Noda fights Takagi and falls down, the back of Masao's shirt is incorrectly spelled. It says \"darts hears\" instead of \"darts hearts\".\n- The school bus is a 1998 Mitsubishi Fuso Rosa.\n"
