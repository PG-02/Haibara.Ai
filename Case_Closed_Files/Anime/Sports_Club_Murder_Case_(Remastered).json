    "Resolution": "After Megure and his men are brought back into the pool area, Kogoro (Conan) reveals to them that Naoya Saijo's death was a murder, not an accident. He mentions that the murderer first knocked Naoya out and dressed him up in swim clothes and ear plugs. However, the earplugs were not the same ones that Naoya had when Conan first saw him. He then points out that a swimming cap was used to disguise the fact that there was no blood or hair found on the diving board. This leads him to reveal that Naoya was killed poolside and the swimming cap was just a ruse and that the murder weapon was a concrete block.\nLastly, he mentions that the old man was unwillingly used as witness for the murder. He could attest that he saw someone diving, as he viewed the building from his apartment at the same time every night. However, the old man never saw who it was exactly due to the lights being turned off, but it was the culprit that took the dive. Kogoro (Conan) then points to Hisashi Kijima as the murderer, due the fact that he was a speed swimmer, who all wore swimming caps. Kogoro (Conan)'s evidence to seal the case is that the old man drew the sparkle from Hisashi Kijima's earring which he was known for as per his nickname.\n\nHisashi reveals that his motive was Naoya blackmailing him for Hisashi's drunk driving accident that led him accidentally injure his girlfriend.\n- Hisashi's girlfriend\n",
