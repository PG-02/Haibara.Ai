    "Situation": "This time Kogoro's client turned out to be a lady who had just recently lost her husband; according to herself, her husband, Yutaka Nemoto, died in a traffic accident three months ago. However, when she was going over her late husband's belongings, she noticed a big stack of bank notes, summing up to 20 million Japanese yen (that's about 134 thousand US dollars) in total. She also called Nemoto a \"tragic genius\", since he was fairly good in baseball competitions and achieved quite a success, but injured himself right before playing within Koshien Stadium; he also developed himself amongst the racing aspect, but he encountered an accident and was forced to retire; he also attempted to become a competitive eater, but unfortunately, he ended up in the hospital when he was supposed to compete in the world championship... Therefore, Nemoto had lots of trophies and souvenirs regarding his splendid career experiences but never managed to reach the top for each of them. Thereafter, he went into despair and was considering committing crime activities... until he met the lady, Eriko Nemoto. Despite undertaking numerous obstacles, they still managed to make a change and were successfully married to each other. They have been married for nine years, and they took one photo for each year, which can be seen in the lady's home. She wondered if her husband had been committing a crime before the car accident, and thus she would want Kogoro to investigate the source of the 20 million yen she found earlier.\n\nUsing the query features embedded into the search engine, there were only three cases that met the qualifications of both \"robebry\", \"three months ago\", and \"20 million yen\". Kogoro was firmly convinced that Nemoto is the culprit, so he began asking around the premises that the three cases happened:\n\n\n\nKogoro was about to tell the truth to his client and asked Ran and Conan to go home. All of a sudden, Conan recalled something from the security footage of Kaneko Jewelry Store, and thought that there were flaws in their initial deduction and must impede Kogoro from telling the false theory to Eriko... Just as Kogoro began speaking to Eriko, Conan arrived at her apartment on time and rang the bell in order to interrupt Kogoro's speech. When Ran and Conan entered the room, Conan immediately tarnquilized Kogoro and began his deduction...\n",

    "Resolution": "",
    "The Origin of the 20 Million Yen": "Conan found out that there was one item being auctioned off for 20 million between three and six months ago - helmet of Randy Schumaker. It was the helmet he was wearing when he first became a motorsports world champion. It was given the information that it was recently sold inatuction for 181,000 US dollars, which can be coconvertednto approximately 20 million yen. This can match with Yutaka as he had a past experience as a racer (retired after the accident mentioned before). The side of the helmet was also written: \"To Yutaka\", this could serve as the evidence for this assumption.\n",
    "Yutaka's Intentions": "Then what did he want to do after selling Schumaker's helmet? The answer was to buy his wife a tenth anniversary gift. This explains why he was lingering within Kaneko's jewelry store; the behaviour that made Conan believe that he was not acting suspicious, was that he was in fact smiling rather than planning to cause harms. So buying jewelry for his wife would seem valid. So the robber who stole the 20 million yen in the store that day could not be Yutaka, as that culprit was targeting cash at the outset, so it must be somebody who knew about the transaction. To finish up Sleeping Kogoro's deduction, Conan brought up the nine photos placed in the room and remarked that her husband gave up his treasured item to commemorate the special tenth anniversary. Lastly, Conan showed Eriko the ring that Yutaka was about to buy for her. After seeing the precious ring, Eriko's tears began to fall as though a waterfall, and she was touched by her husband's kidnapping.\n",
    "Aftermath": "After solving the Yutaka case, Kogoro smoothly cooperated with Takagi and resolved the other three 20 million yen-related incidents:\n- Madam's acquaintance\n- Mr. Kizushima's son\n",
    "Trivia": "- Starting this episode, the former producer and planning staff of the series since 1996, Michihiko Suwa, stepped down from the supervisor role; his name has been in the credits for 27 years and 9 months.\n- The character Keita Kaneko and his jewelry store reappears and encountered a robbery once again.\n- Just like other episodes written by Yamatoya, the characters' names come from certain horse racing-related terms[1] :\nYutaka Nemoto (根本 豊) comes from a Japanese jockey Yutaka Take (武 豊 ,Take Yutaka?);\nRandy Schumaker (ランディ・シューメイカー) comes from an American jockey Bill Shoemaker (ウウィリー・シューメーカー ,William Shoemaker?).\n- Yutaka Nemoto (根本 豊) comes from a Japanese jockey Yutaka Take (武 豊 ,Take Yutaka?);\n- Randy Schumaker (ランディ・シューメイカー) comes from an American jockey Bill Shoemaker (ウウィリー・シューメーカー ,William Shoemaker?).\n- The browser Kogoro and Conan use is \"Guruguru\" (グルグル), which is a reference to the popular browser Google (グーグル ,Gūguru?).\n- Yutaka Nemoto (根本 豊) comes from a Japanese jockey Yutaka Take (武 豊 ,Take Yutaka?);\n- Randy Schumaker (ランディ・シューメイカー) comes from an American jockey Bill Shoemaker (ウウィリー・シューメーカー ,William Shoemaker?).\n",
