    "Situation": "Kogoro is invited to Kagoshima for a variety talk show to promote their local shochu and is later invited by Takakuma Shochu to sample their handmade sake. Tatsumura wants to increase production of sake by mechanizing the production process at the expense of quality. Fumiko takes Kogoro on a tour of the city and asks him to decline Tatsumura's offer to be a spokesperson. Later, Tatsumura is found to be missing. There is blood on the floor and evidence to suggest that he was struck with a blunt object and kidnapped. Two days pass and then through an anonymous tip, the police discover Tatsumura dead in his car in a park.\n\nConan, Kogoro, and the police continue to search for clues to solving the case. Conan learns more about Tatsumura, the current owner, Satoshi, and the company's history from one of the employees. Satoshi is unwilling to fire Tatsumura because he was responsible for saving the company years ago. Conan learns that Fumiko used to be a nurse, and that she made sure Tatsumura got a check up the day before he got murdered/kidnapped. Everyone gathers to hear Kogoro's deduction, and Conan reveals the culprit's trick.\n",
