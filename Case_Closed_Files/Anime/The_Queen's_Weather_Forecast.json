    "Situation": "Kogoro is at Nichiuri TV office, filming \"Detective VS Weather Reporter\" with Yasumi Sekine while Conan and Ran watch at the sidelines with Yukio Kodama, Takuya Yamaguchi, and Hiroko Shinohara. After the filming, Kogoro and Ran rest in a room while Conan goes to a vending machine to buy a bottle of oolong tea. As he picks up the bottle, he notices Yasumi and Yukio conversing secretly. After the small talk, they head out and split off. Then, Takuya hesitantly comes out of a room and follows Yasumi, and Conan follows him. Yasumi meets with Hiroko, who tells her the stage is good and ready. Hiroko asks her if she wanted to check the stage, but she said no because she trusted her.\nThe two women thank Kogoro for spending time for the filming of the TV show. After everyone meets up in the room Kogoro is resting in, Yasumi heads to a nearby room to shoot a video. In this shooting, she would stand on a misty stage, with snow falling steadily all around her. Since Kogoro is done filming, he, Ran, and Conan can go home. However, just when they thought about leaving, they hear a popping noise, followed by the sound of gas spraying, then Yasumi's scream, and finally the sound of something falling. Everyone rushes out of the room, only to see Yasumi already fallen from the second floor through the broken railings to the first floor, dead.\n\nConan, who is examining Yasumi's body with Kogoro, notices a few strange points. Only the left side of her hair is tangled up, she wrote a dying message beside her with her own blood, and her hair accessory is near the wall, far away from her body. After the police arrive to investigate, Conan and Kogoro inspect the stage, which contains roses at both sides and tinsels on the way down, and notice a blue popped balloon, which is what caused the popping sound before Yasumi's scream. Kogoro suddenly gains insight and tells everyone his deduction about the case.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (fell)\n- 27 years old\n- Weather forecaster\n- 49 years old\n- Nichiuri TV producer\n- 35 years old\n- Yasumi's manager\n- 28 years old\n- Nichiuri TV assistant director\n",
    "Resolution": "Yasumi was checking the stage and fell for the trap, which was only meant to frighten her. However, she was so shocked that she staggered to the railing and fell through it to her death. The detective found a strip of duct tape stuck on the tensil and declares that the culprit is Hiroko Shinohara, who has a roll of that same kind of tape. Also, the TV producer overheard her conversation in the kitchen yesterday, declaring she would embarrass Yasumi with that trap. She admits to devising that trap because she hated Yasumi for her selfishness and arrogance. Though she admits that she never thought that the trap she set would've have killed Yasumi.\nHowever, Conan thinks something is not right. Kogoro's deduction, while not entirely wrong, does not explain why there was the sound of gas spraying, why only the left side of Yasumi's hair was tangled, and why her hair accessory was found near the wall. He heads to a pile of roses and finds a smoke machine, with some brown substance smeared on its funnel.\nAs Inspector Megure, Detective Takagi, and Hiroko walk away, Conan puts Kogoro to sleep and tells everyone there more to the case than just Hiroko's simple balloon trap. Even though Yasumi said she would not check the stage, she went there anyway because the true culprit told her about Hiroko's trap. The culprit advised her to pop the balloon before the filming to make a fool out of Hiroko, who Yasumi wanted to torment even more. He also told her she would be safe if she stood near the railing.\nShe did exactly what he told her and popped the balloon, which unexpectedly activated a second trap the culprit set up. When she popped the balloon, he turned on the smoke machine that was set to maxiumum power. The machine sprayed out carbon gas at great intensity, causing her to be blinded and back off to the railing, which most likely was already broken beforehand, and resulting in her falling to her death. The gas sprayed from her left, tangling up the left side of her hair and blowing her hair accessory off her head and toward the wall. Essentially, the culprit put his trap behind Hiroko's so that he could use her as a scapegoat for the crime to avoid suspicion.\nThe true culprit is none other than Yukio Kodama, who knew about Hiroko's balloon trap. The conversation Conan overheard when he purchased a bottle of oolong tea was about Yukio telling Yasumi about Hiroko's trap and advising her to stay near the railing. The first piece of evidence that he is culprit is the brown smudge on the smoke machine's funnel. Yukio polished his brown shoes this morning, but because it was drizzling and humid, the shoe polish did not dry.\nBefore the incident, the funnel was pointed toward the railing, so after the fall occurred, he had to turn it back to its original position. He did that with his foot, as a result some of the brown shoe polish was smeared on the funnel. The second piece of evidence is the remote control he was carrying the whole time to activate the smoke machine. Since he was with everyone else during Yasumi's fall, the smoke machine had to be controlled wirelessly.\n"
