    "Situation": "Agasa takes the Detective Boys to his uncle's house which has been abandoned fifty years ago for a treasure hunt he had set up. Conan finds a 1 yen coin and reveals to Agasa that those coins were not produced until forty years ago and that someone had been living in the abandoned house. Conan investigates and finds evidence that an old man who spent his spare time carving coins lived in the house. Conan notices that someone has drawn strange codes on objects throughout the house. The codes are symbols consisting of the moon, star, and sun. The Detective Boys manage to find their treasure and realize that someone had destroyed them all. Conan deduces that an unknown culprit entered the house in search of some kind of treasure and was angered when Agasa's riddles lead him to a box of toys. Conan and the Detective Boys gather all the objects in the house with the strange codes on them and attempts to solve it. Agasa reveals that his aunt was receiving letters in the same code and that he had Yusaku Kudo decipher the message. He also reveals that when his aunt began receiving those letters, someone was looking through her mail. Conan realizes the symbols refer to Hiragana and that the culprit who was looking through Agasa's aunt's mail is the one who destroyed the toys and is searching for the treasure in the house.\nWhile they were investigating, there was a man who was lurking around the house. They found an attic and a dead man who become a skeleton. There's also a map beside his body.\n",

    "Resolution": "- Deceased (illness)\n- Counterfeiter\n- Artist\n- Robber\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga, the voice-changer is in the form of a pen instead of the Kamen Yaiba Voice Changer.\n",
    "Trivia": "- In the manga, this case was before Ai Haibara make an appearance, while in the anime she didn't want to come and play along with Agasa, so the Detective Boys' statement in Search for Maria-chan! and Agasa's in The Antique Tray Can't Be Hidden are wrong.\n",
