    "Situation": "Kisaki found herself defending a burglar being charged by the state prosecutor with murder instead of manslaughter. The burglar had been caught in the act in the inner office of a company by the proprietor. He managed to flee after a struggle where he knocked out his opponent with an ashtray. The proprietor had been discovered dead by his son-in-law and the building superintendent, who witnessed from the eyehole of the inner office door the taking place.\n\nThe superintendent went to call the police while the son-in-law knocked the door open. According to the charges, the suspect forced the victim to open the safe, where a large sum of cash was discovered missing, and subsequently fled through the window. The suspect admitted the burglary attempt, hitting the victim, but denied stealing the money. During the first hearing, Kisaki discovered the reason why the prosecution pressed for the murder charge: the victim had once cheated the daughter of the suspect. Ran persuaded Kogoro to investigate to help Kisaki defend the suspect.\nConan went along with Kogoro during the investigation. He helped Kisaki and Kogoro realize that the superintendent only saw the shadow image of an assault.\n",
