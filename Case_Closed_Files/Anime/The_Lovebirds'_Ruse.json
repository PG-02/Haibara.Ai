    "Resolution": "The case is actually murder, and the culprit is Seiko Kanbayashi. The Kanbayashis merely pretended to be happily married, but their life together has long since gone to shambles, and they have become interested in different partners. Chosaku had been hatching a plan to kill his wife to reap in her life insurance, but he wasn't aware that Seiko was trying to do away with him as well.\nChosaku originally planned have the documents sent to his wife to make her come to him. Then he would pretend to leave his office for cigarettes, then go into the neighboring building to open a bathroom window on the fifth floor. After returning to his office (for an eyewitness testimony), he intended to jump from his building into the bathroom next door, intercept Seiko in the park which she was sure to walk through, and strangle her. Then he would return the same way and deliver his manuscript, again with an eyewitness, thus consolidating his own alibi.\n"
