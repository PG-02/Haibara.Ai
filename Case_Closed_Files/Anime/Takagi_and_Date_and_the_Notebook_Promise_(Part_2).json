    "Situation": "Conan, Haibara and the Detective Boys have just visited Agasa due to his injury from a previous case and are now returning. They help each other to cheer Haibara up after the previous events, and luckily Yukiko also came back to cook for her at that time so everything was fine. However, they encounter a robber being chased by Inspector Takagi, he runs toward the boys, terrifying Haibara because she associated that image with Gin chasing her. Fortunately, Sato comes to the rescue in time, much to the admiration of the Detective Boys, and then when Takagi is about to write down the time the robber was captured in Date's notebook, he sees a string of characters and a note: Meet Takagi on Sunday. This made him remember the memory of his senior, the day before he passed away due to a traffic accident, Sato and the boys also begin to pay attention to the note above, and from here the decoding begins at Poirot's, where Conan quickly notices the code.\nAzusa is a little surprised to see Takagi and Sato with the kids, but is later drawn into the group to solve the code, first starting with the reason why the code leads to Poirot's:\n- Call the SMS center with a phone with a tone and a recorded message will play.\n- Follow the instructions and enter the recipient's phone number\n- Start the message with *2*2, compose the message with two numbers for each character according to this table, and finally end it with #s\nExplaining why Date wanted to appeal to Takagi's male instincts, Amuro assumes that his deceased friend wanted Takagi to solve a case to become a real detective, and thinks that a shady plot might be going on here. While discussing the location, Conan notices a piece of tape under the table he and the others are sitting at, so he asks Azusa about it, who only remembers that there was a game console with a game running in sleep mode with tape right on the floor in that chair and she is now currently holding it. It seems that the person who was supposed to appear in the shop didn't show up, causing it to fall down after a while.\nShe is then asked if she had seen anyone suspicious, to which she mentions a boy who would make a strange gesture in front of the shop while in his car every Sunday afternoon. During those five minutes, the boy would always hold up five fingers, then fold his thumb, then fold his other four fingers, and then rewind the action. Conan and Haibara immediately recognize this as a distress signal after confirming that he was a foreigner, as the hand gesture was a distress signal originating from Canada.\n\n\n\n",
