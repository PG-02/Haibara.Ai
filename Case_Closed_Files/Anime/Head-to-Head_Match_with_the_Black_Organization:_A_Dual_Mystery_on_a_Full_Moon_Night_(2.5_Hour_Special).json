    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Kogoro receives an invitation to a Halloween cruise; the Halloween cruise is famous for hiring guests to star in a horror film. Conan receives the same invitation from Vermouth; the invitation however is addressed to Conan Edogawa and Shinichi Kudo, meaning Vermouth knows his true identity. During the cruise, the party members are divided into groups with team devil consisting of Kogoro, Sonoko, and people disguised as a werewolf, a mummy, a medusa and an invisible man. During the party, the host is shot by a crossbow, attached to the arrow is a card from team devil.\n\nThe Mummy is the prime suspect since he lacks an alibi and his card is missing.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (arrow shot)\n- \"The Haunted Ship\" series movie producer\n- Real name: Senzo Fukura\n- Party participant in the Devil's card group\n- Party participant in the Devil's card group\n- Signed in as Shinichi Kudo\n- Party participant in the Devil's card group\n- Party participant in the Devil's card group\n- Party participant in the Devil's card group\n- Party participant\n",
    "Resolution": "The invisible man gathers the party guests to the bow of the boat and reveals his identity as Shinichi and declares the Werewolf as the murderer. He reveals that the werewolf placed his mask on the Mummy to establish his own alibi evidenced when the Werewolf come out of the Mummy's bathroom stall. Shinichi speculates that he obtained sleeping gas from the organization beforehand and drugged the Mummy participant unconscious to perform this trick. To support this, Shinichi points to the fact that the Werewolf claimed he was busy concentrating on staying in character so he could be hired to star in the movie, yet the Mummy participant unknowingly disguised as him was drinking a cocktail, known as a \"Silver Bullet\" and this object being the only thing that could kill a werewolf brings suspicion to the Werewolf. As evidence, Shinichi reveals that there was glass shards on the balcony where the host was killed and that there should be glass shards between the soles of the Werewolf's shoes. The Werewolf confesses blaming Vermouth for his ordeal and begging for help. He revealed that he expressed sentiments to kill Senzo Fukura on a hate forum because his taking over as the new producer of the \"Ghost Captain\" movie series completely ruined the show. Vermouth found this post and sent him threatening pictures of his house and family to blackmail him to kill the captain and lure Shinichi from her attempt to murder Haibara. Elsewhere, Haibara is picked up by Jodie while they are followed by Tomoaki Araide.\nJodie confronts Araide at the pier who reveals that it is Vermouth in disguise. Back at the party, Shinichi is revealed to be Heiji in disguise, this was done to distract Vermouth from noticing Conan's absence. Jodie recalled the events 20 years ago: Vermouth killed Jodie's father and burned his house to ashes to stop an investigation against her. By coincidence, Jodie was not in the house at the time of the fire and was saved.\n\nTo take over Tomoaki Araide's identity and approach Haibara, Vermouth attempted to murder him and his family. It was intervened by FBI so they escaped safely.\n\nBack in present time, Jodie Starling revealed Vermouth's disguise and was about to capture her. However, unbeknownst to her, Vermouth had disguised as Jodie and lured the FBI agents away. Jodie was then shot by Vermouth's accompanying partner, Calvados.\n\nUpon seeing the situation change, Haibara is revealed to be Conan in disguise and attempts to subdue Vermouth. However, the real Haibara arrives at the pier and is narrowly saved from death by Ran's timely appearance.\n\nThe last character then entered the scene. Akai Shuichi, revealed to be an FBI agent, shot Calvados to render him useless. Calvados then committed suicide.\n\nSeeing the situation is disadvantaged on her side, Vermouth fled away, capturing unconscious Conan as hostage.\n\nConan reveals to Vermouth he has a covert listening device on him that will send everything that was said to the authorities in the event of his death. Vermouth exhales a sleeping gas on Conan and tells him she will postpone her plan on murdering Haibara for now. Conan awakens to find out the device has been destroyed and no evidence of the Black Organization remain.\nSummary\n- Vermouth was disguised as Tomoaki Araide.\n- Vodka was disguised as Zombie.\n- Conan Edogawa was disguised as Ai Haibara.\n- Heiji Hattori was disguised as Shinichi Kudo underneath the Invisible Man costume.\n- Yukiko Kudo was disguised as Medusa.\n- The murderer which Shinichi Kudo and Ran Mouri encountered in New York was actually Vermouth.\n- The given codename for Vermouth in the FBI was \"Rotten Apple\".\n- Shuichi Akai was previously considered by Vermouth as the Black Organization's \"Silver Bullet\", but from the end of this episode onwards (even up to The Raven Chaser) she finally thought the organization's real downfall would be Shinichi Kudo.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the anime, in the flashback to Vermouth killing Jodie's father Vermouth has a bruise/or dirt/or a scratch of some kind on one side of her face that is consistent across several frames looking like a defensive mark. This mark is not present in the manga at all.\n- Akai is shown to cock and fire the shotgun singlehandedly, having his other hand in his pocket, in the manga and in the anime they show him using both hands.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This case is the first two and a half hour special.\n- Jodie's car is a white Peugeot 607 with the license plate of .823.\n- Araide's car is a Toyota Prius with the license plate of .323.\n- Calvados had a rifle, a shotgun, and three handguns, although Akai missed his pocket pistol, which was used to commit suicide.\n- In the post-credit scene, Gin is now driving a Porsche with the license plate of 43-68, in stead of the 48-69, which it was in Reunion with the Black Organization.\n- When Jodie was talking with Araide about an upcoming trial, she was referring to The Blind Spot in the Darkness case, where he is expected to testify at, only she now knows the truth about that case.\n- Yukiko revealed that it took her six hours to perfect Heiji's disguise.\n",
