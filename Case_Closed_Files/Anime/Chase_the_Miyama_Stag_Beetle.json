    "Situation": "At Teitan Elementary School, Genta and Mitsuhiko see a student showing off because he managed to catch a beetle and get jealous.\nAt Agasa's house, Genta and Mitsuhiko tell Agasa about catching the rhinoceros beetle and Agasa knows a place to get them. Agasa's old friend lives in Kofu, Yamanashi Prefecture, so Conan, Haibara, Agasa, and the Detective Boys go on a trip.\nWhen they arrive, they meet Agasa's old friend named Ryutarou Namatame. Later, Genta is thirsty so they all go to the shop called \"Michi no eki\" where they sell food and drinks. Namatame talks to a man named Kei Yabe who's eating ramen while getting a bit upset about Yabe telling Namatame a lie that he's been playing pachinko. Yabe tells Namatame that it's not what it looks like.\nGenta and Mitsuhiko find the bug cages filled with all kinds of beetles and they are excited about it until suddenly, the man named Shuhei Ikeda tells Genta and Mitsuhiko not to touch it. He tells them that the Tocoro Department is coming to retrieve them. Namatame tells Ikeda that the kids want to look at them and Ikeda doesn't have to make a big fuss about it. After that, Namatame tells the Detective Boys when Ikeda was a child, he was very stingy.\nAt Namatame's house, the Detective Boys are having watermelon for a snack. They have made a plan to go into the forest and catch some beetles.\nIn the forest, Conan puts slices of stinky bananas mixed with sake into socks that each of Detective Boys are holding and ties the socks to the branches of a tree so later the beetles will be attracted to it at night.\nWhen Conan, Haibara, and the Detective Boys find a truck, Genta looks inside and Yabe suddenly appears from under the truck. Yabe angrily asks Genta what is he looking at. Genta didn't do anything wrong so Yabe tells the kids to go away.\nThat night at Namatame's house, Namatame and Agasa are having a little conversation about Agasa's inventions. At precisely 10:00 pm, the Detective Boys head back to the forest where they left their bait to attract the beetles. Namatame warns the kids that there could be snakes in the forest so Agasa decides to go with them.\nIn the forest, they are lot of beetles on the socks attached to the tree branches, and the Detective Boys are very happy to have caught them. As they head back to the house, they spot Ikeda walking on the streets moaning about Namatame.\nWhen Conan, Haibara, Agasa, and the Detective Boys arrive at Namatame's house, they find Namatame lying on the floor, bloodied and injured.\n\nConan tells Namatame to get a hold of himself and suddenly, Namatame says \"Miyama stag beetle\" (ミヤマクワガタ ,Miyama Kuwagata?) before losing consciousness. When Haibara is about to call an ambulance with her cellphone, she notices that the Buddha statue Ryutarou had is gone.\n\nHaibara doesn't have a signal on her cellphone so she goes outside to look for one. Conan finds a small amount of hair on Namatame's back and wonders what did Namatame mean by \"Miyama stag beetle\".\nNamatame is taken to the hospital still unconscious. The police arrive, and the investigation begins. Conan and the Detective Boys report everything they've seen, and also about the Buddha statue that had gone missing. The police also mention a similar case involving another missing Buddha statue that took place at Kenkan Temple. Conan gives the hair he found on Namatame to the police so they can give it to the forensics team to exam it. Agasa is still wondering what Namatame meant when he said \"Miyama stag beetle\", because, of course, the culprit can't be the beetle. Haibara mentions that she and the Detective Boys saw Ikeda while walking in the forest. Genta now knows that he has seen the beetles at Michi no eki.\nThe police find Ikeda and they want to bring him in for questioning. The police ask Ikeda where he was at 12:00 am. Mitsuhiko says that he was walking on the streets angrily saying, \"That Ryutarou! I can't let my guard down!\" The reason why Ikeda was saying that is because when he was watering the rice garden, the water suddenly turned off. The only one who could and would do that was Namatame. That's why he wanted to teach him a lesson when saw him again. He says that he never would have tried to kill Namatame. Conan asks Ikeda about the Buddha statue. Ikeda remembers there was a dirty one and he has a clue. He talks about Kei Yabe who had lots of tools in his truck while being very sneaky. That made Ikeda suspicious. Genta remembers Yabe was wearing a Miyama stag beetle shirt.\nThe police visit Yabe because they want to question him. They ask Yabe where he was at 12:00 am. Yabe says he was at home, alone. Ikeda calls Yabe a liar because when Ikeda was watering the rice field and when he was on his way home, he visited Yabe's house and his truck wasn't there. The police asks Yabe if he did enter Namatame's house, assault him, and steal the Buddha statue. Yabe denies it. Conan asks Officer Iwanaga about hair that was found on Namatame and Officer Iwanaga says it belonged to a dog.\nConan, Haibara, and Agasa head back to Michi no eki to find some clues. Conan asked anybody if they remember Conan and the group visiting to Michi no eki. Nobody can remember except one person who sells plants. The plant owner remembered they was a couple buying the potted flower. The plant owner showed the potted flower to Conan and seeing this finally helps him solve the case.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (beaten - injured)\n- 52 years old\n- Agasa's old friend\n- 27 years old\n- 50 years old\n- 45 years old\n- Yamanashi Prefecture Police detective\n- 27 years old\n- Yamanashi Prefecture Police sergeant\n- 55 years old\n- Yamanashi Prefecture, Kofu Station police detective\n- Woman's husband\n- Man's wife\n- Michi no eki Flower Shop owner\n- Couple's dog\n- Maltese breed\n",
    "Resolution": "Ikeda and Yabe is not the culprit who assaulted Namatame and stole the Buddha statue. However, Yabe did commit a robbery when he stole the Buddha statue from the Kenkan Temple last night, not from Namatame. Conan found it under Yabe's truck before he investigated the Michi no eki. If Ikeda and Yabe were the culprits, since Namatame had already known their names he wouldn't have had to say Miyama stag beetle. When Conan and the others arrived back at Namatame's house, the lights were on. Namatame went to bed but he heard something, and went to the meeting room, turned the lights on, and was attacked.\nWhen they visited the Michi no eki, Namatame was gloating about the Buddha statue from the Kamakura period. At that time, a couple that looked like tourists were there. The couple bought one potted plant. Haibara shows the potted flower with the little tag to the police and they could not believe what they've just seen. When Namatame said Miyama stag beetle he was not referring to the insect, but the plant with the same name (Miyama Kuwagata in Japanese but the scientific name is Pseudolysimachion schmidtianum subsp. senanense). They are both pronounced the same but have different meanings. Namatame did see the culprit's face but didn’t know the name of the culprit. So instead what he meant was that the culprit is the one that bought the potted flower. As evidence, according to the plant owner that sold the potted flower, the plant owner said the couple had a dog. The little hairs that Conan found on Namatame came from the couple's dog. If the DNA matches, it will prove that they are the culprits.\nAfter that, with quick work from the police, they searched all the hotels that allowed pets and managed to find the couple. The couple that was caught and arrested in Tokyo thought they could sell the Buddha statue that they heard was from the Kamakura period for a high price. They followed Agasa's car and snuck into Namatame's house to steal it. However, when they got it appraised, it was not made by anyone in particular and wasn't worth much at all. Namatame was released from the hospital after about 2-3 days.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Namatame's house reappears in a painting in Suzuki Museum from Kaitou Kid and the Blush Mermaid.\n- Ryutarou Namatame's truck is a Mazda Bongo.\n- Kei Yabe's truck is a Mazda Bongo. The license plate number is 甲府 410, は 19-20 (Kofu 410, Ha 19-20).\n"
