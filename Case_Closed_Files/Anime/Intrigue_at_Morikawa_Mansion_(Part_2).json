    "Resolution": "Conan deduces that Yujiro was killed when he asked Yuichiro to meet him at the tank room. The evidence is the bamboo charcoal Yuichiro used to make the new soft serve flavor, which was found at the tank room and Yuzaburo's room. Yuzan, who oversaw all of this using the cameras installed in every room, mustered the last bit of his strength and killed Yuichiro. The evidence is that there was the smell of the gunpowder, medicine, and Yuzan himself inside the tool room.\nYuzan clarified that Yujiro is the one who tried to kill Yuichiro. Yuzan plays the camera footage that shows when Yujiro and Yuichiro had a fight at the tank room, Yuichiro ended up getting the upper hand and killed him accidentally. Yuzan confesses that the reason he planned to rewrite the will is that he wanted his sons to remember what he had taught since they were boys, which is the willingness to share with each other. In the end, he asks Conan to tell the police what happened, and to make sure Yuichiro's recipe sees the light of day. After saying that, Yuzan dies peacefully in his bed.\n\nLater, Oi arrives at the room and informs Conan that Yuzan has entrusted whoever solved the case with the distribution of his inheritance, which means Conan is the one who will do it. Conan decides to leave the entire inheritance to Yuka Shito, in whom he saw actual interest in the soft serve over the money. Through Oi, he hands over Yuichiro's recipe and asks her to make it public and she agrees remembering the good times that she and the three brothers shared when they were children.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Screenplay writer Akatsuki Yamatoya disclosed on his personal horse racing blog that the plot inspiration comes from the conversation between him and his drinking friends in 2019. Yuichiro Morikawa, Hiroki Oi, and Yuka Shito are all named after his drinking friends.\n- The scenario that Ran squeezed out ice cream contaminated with blood pays homage to the Kindaichi movie Opera House, The New Murder (1996).\n- The soft serve rice bowl is inspired by Hijikata Special (rice topped with mayo) in the anime Gin Tama.\n- The mansion's car is a black Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit Stretched Limousine.\n",
    "Quotes": "- Yuzan Morikawa (to Conan Edogawa):\nMoney leads people astray, both those who have it and those who don't. Those who have money build walls to protect it, while those who don't easily break laws and hurt people to get their hands on it.  (金は人を惑わせる、持つ者も持たざる者もな。持つ者はそれを守らんと壁を作り、持たざる者はそれを無理にでも得ようと、いとも簡単に法を破り、人を傷つける｡)\n"
