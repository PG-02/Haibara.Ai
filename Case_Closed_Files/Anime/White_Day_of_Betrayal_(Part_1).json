    "Situation": "Kogoro appears in a commercial to promote white chocolate for White Day and is invited to the chocolate company's White Day party. Kogoro, Ran, and Conan attend and are introduced to the company presidents, Taruto Urai and his wife Hoshie Urai. During the party, Taruto collapses. At first thought to be one of his practical jokes, Conan quickly notices that Taruto has died from cyanide poisoning.\n\nInspector Megure and his officers are called to investigate the death. The investigation leads Hoshie to be the prime suspect. As she is taken away to be searched, Hoshie trips and falls on a table causing many lemon tea glasses to shatter. Meanwhile, evidence of a medicinal wafer containing poison is found in Urai's mouth, suggesting suicide.\nDespite all appearing to be a suicide case, Conan is certain that Hoshie is the culprit and investigates on how she delivered the poison to her husband, finally finding several pieces of critical evidence and exposing her.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (poison)\n- 53 years old\n- Urai Confections Company president\n- 49 years old\n- Taruto's wife\n- Urai Confections Company vice-president\n- Tokyo MPD CSI Officer\n- Haido Hotel master of ceremonies\n- Haido Hotel staff\n",
    "Resolution": "\n- Deceased (Suicide)\n- Hoshie's boyffriend\nWhen confronted with the facts, Hoshie Urai confesses, revealing her motive is revenge for the death of her boyfriend who had started his apprenticeship along with her in Taruto's confectionery. During a competition, her boyfriend was clearly considered the prospective winner because of his outstanding sour confections, but Taruto, who favored Hoshie, decided to push him out of the race by claiming that his confections were way too sour. Devastated by this fake assessment, the boy had hung himself; Taruto's subsequent distaste for sour things resulted from his panging conscience for inadvertently having caused his apprentice's death. His guilt came to daylight after Hoshie had recently fed him a sour lemon cake, whereupon Taruto had collapsed and told everything.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Episode 609 was originally scheduled to be aired on March 12, 2011. However, due to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, it was postponed to March 19, 2011.\n- The names of the suspects come from \"fortune-telling\"[1] :\nTaruto Urai (浦井 垂人) comes from \"tarot fortune-telling\" (タロット占い ,Tarotto Uranai?) and \"tarts\" (タルト ,taruto?), as related to his occupation ;\nHoshie Urai (浦井 星江) comes from \"horoscope\" (星占い ,hoshiuranai?).\n- Taruto Urai (浦井 垂人) comes from \"tarot fortune-telling\" (タロット占い ,Tarotto Uranai?) and \"tarts\" (タルト ,taruto?), as related to his occupation ;\n- Hoshie Urai (浦井 星江) comes from \"horoscope\" (星占い ,hoshiuranai?).\n- Taruto Urai (浦井 垂人) comes from \"tarot fortune-telling\" (タロット占い ,Tarotto Uranai?) and \"tarts\" (タルト ,taruto?), as related to his occupation ;\n- Hoshie Urai (浦井 星江) comes from \"horoscope\" (星占い ,hoshiuranai?).\n",
