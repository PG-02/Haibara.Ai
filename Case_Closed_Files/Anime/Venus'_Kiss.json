    "Situation": "Kogoro is invited with Ran and Conan to an aquarium where an underwater play is to take place. They meet the man named Masato Hayashi who is a stage director. Next to him is the woman who plays as Venus named Michiko Oosawa. When Hayashi gives a tour around the aquarium, they meet two other people. There's Yasuyuki Murakawa, the head of staff. Finally, there's Yuriko Minegishi, she counts as another Venus in the group. Later during the show, Oosawa's dead body rises from the water when it's her cue to come out of a clam's shell in the play.\n\n",
    "People": "- 40 years old\n- Beika Street Aquarium stage director\n- Victim (drowned)\n- 25 years old\n- Underwater show actress\n- Plays as Venus\n- 44 years old\n- Beika Street Aquarium staff head\n- 30 years old\n- Underwater show actress\n- Venus replacement\n- Beika Street Aquarium staff member\n- Michiko's father\n- Oosawa Construction Corp CEO\n- Beika Street Aquarium owner\n",
    "Resolution": "Conan realizes that Michiko's death isn't an accident but a premeditated murder. He stuns Kogoro and explains to everyone that the culprit snuck in while she was putting on make-up. The culprit knocked her out, put a medicine wrap on her leg, and then placed her inside the shell. When the shell filled up the water, she drowned while she was unconscious. The medicine wrap was to mislead people as to her cause of death, by making them think that she drowned due to leg pains.\nThe evidence is an upside-down lipstick mark that got on his shirt when he was carrying Michiko to the shell. Only the culprit could've got such a mark from carrying her body over his shoulder.\nMurakawa confesses and revealed that his wife and his child were killed in a \"hit-and-run\" car accident two years ago.\n- Deceased (car accident)\n- Yasuyuki's wife\n- Deceased (car accident)\n- Yasuyuki's child\n\n"
