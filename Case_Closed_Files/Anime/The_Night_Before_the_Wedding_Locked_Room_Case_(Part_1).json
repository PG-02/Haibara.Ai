    "Situation": "Heiji and Kazuha visit Tokyo accompanied by Kogoro, Ran, and Conan. They run into the butler of Heiji's mother's late friend's family and are invited to their mansion. The son of the friend is getting married the next day. There a murder occurs and the butler is found dead in a locked room. It seems he was dragged to another room after being stabbed in the heart.\n\nContinuing the investigation, Heiji proclaims the family servant was the murderer and he is taken away, screaming his innocence.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (stabbed)\n- 51 years old\n- Morizono family steward\n- 22 years old\n- Kikuhito's fiancé\n- 23 years old\n- Morizono family servant\n- 28 years old\n- Eldest Morizono daughter\n- 57 years old\n- Morizono family head\n- 26 years old\n- Eldest Morizono son\n- Deceased (car accident)\n- 38 years old (4 years ago)\n- Michio's wife\n- Yurie and Kikuhito's mother\n- Shizuka's classmate\n- Morizono family's cat\n- Nichiuri TV reporter\n- Nichiuri TV reporter\n",
    "Resolution": "The real culprit is revealed to be Kikuhito Morizono. Heiji and Conan fake him out by stating Sakuraba is the criminal, and have Kikuhito recover the bundle of murder discovered by Heiji and Conan eairlier. The trick explained earlier was not really used. The proof is the presence of bloodstains on the lock but absence of it in the balcony. Actually, there were no tricks used, since, in reality, Kikuhito was there in the room all the time. Conan joins the deduction show and points out that Kikuhito were hiding behind the left curtain in the room next to the one where the body was found. That's why the shutters was closed, so that no one could see from the outside that he were hiding behind the curtains. He also switched the lights off and dragged the body from one room to another, leaving a bloody trail. This way, after forcing the door open, they would logically follow the trail to the next room and their attention was focused on the corpse. After that, Kikuhito came out from behind the curtains and joined the people who had gathered at the scene while pretending to be innocent. He put the cat in the room so as to make Sakuraba's alibi fragile. He knew his father would ask Sakuraba to find the cat if it was missing. The blood-splattered shirt was one he had stolen from Sakuraba. He rolled the shirt around the murder weapon and the gloves together and throwed them through the window. He broke the window with the chair to get their attention and have them found the body. The tools he threw ended up stuck in the tree so the police can't find it. Since his afraid of heights and he needs to get rid of the murder weapon, he didn't have a choice so he threw it.\n",
    "Motive": "Kikuhito admitted the crime. He said that Shigematsu was blackmailing him to cancel the wedding. If he didn't cancel the wedding, Shigematsu will tell his father about his company's bad payments. That's why he killed his butler, so his secret will not be found out and to prevent future blackmailing. He wanted to put the blame on Sakuraba, who stole his fiancee. However, the truth is Sakuraba didn't steal her. Kaede always came there to see him. Shigematsu, thought she was there for Kikuhito, arranged the marriage. He was wrong, just as Kikuhito's father was long ago. He never mentioned it because he didn't dare, thinking of the shock it would cause him. Furthermore, he was the one who united them. Shigematsu didn't want to blackmail him. He only wanted him to renounce the wedding so Kaede and Sakuraba could be together, so that couple wouldn't have to endure the same circumstance as he had long ago.\n",
