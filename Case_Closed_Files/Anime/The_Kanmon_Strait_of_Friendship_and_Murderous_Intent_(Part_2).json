Eiko excuses herself and leaves the group, at which point, Akane explains that Eiko was a girlfriend of Hondo and still remains single because she couldn't forget him. Akitaya also leaves as well which Ran senses something but chooses not to say.\nThe trio has dinner with them which is interrupted again by Hario, who is trying to buy Akitaya's businesses, but he refuse to sell. Hario quickly leaves afterward but not before insulting the late Hondo and knocking away Otsubo.\nThe next day, Kogoro, Ran, and Conan plan to visit the famous Mōri Motonari, claimed by Kogoro to be one of the Mouri family's ancestors. However, they're soon caught up in a murder at Kanmonkyo Bridge.\n\nKogoro immediately suspects the four friends, all of whom had motives. However, when he questions them, all of them have solid alibis during the murder time, forcing the police to release them. However, something tips Conan off when he notices that Eiko wears eyeglasses when driving.\nWith some investigation by the police and Kogoro, Conan begins and investigation of his own. He discovers that the friends took advantage of Eiko's poor eyesight, so that one of them could commit the murder. It is then revealed that thirteen years ago that man caused their fifth friend to commit suicide.\nAfter some talk with Ran, Eiko turns herself to the police and confesses that she murdered Hario because he refused to apologize to the late Hondo.
