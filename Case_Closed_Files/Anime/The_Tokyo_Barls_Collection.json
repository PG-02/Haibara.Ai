    "Resolution": "- It is virtually impossible for someone to plant a cabbage core inside the monja to choke Toyoko and murder her, as Monja's ingredients were all chopped up during the time that it was made, meaning that it must be planted the moment Toyoko was about to take a bite and thus only she herself was capable of the crime.\n- Her three friends all share the same filmsy motive for the \"murder\": Toyoko stealing each of their boyfriends durings the highschool, all of which happened roughly sixty years ago.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The episode's title is a play on Tokyo Girls Collection, which is a semiannual fashion festival, replacing the katakana for \"ga\" with the kanji \"ba\" (old woman).\n- Renya Karasuma is added into the opening after his identity is revealed in the preview episode.\n"
