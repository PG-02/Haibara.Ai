    "Cast": "",
    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Yumi was unaware of Shukichi being a famous shogi player for a long time, mostly due to her lack of interest in investigating, and an apparent personal disinterest in shogi (she is more of a Mahjong type). She assumed Shukichi was a \"meijin\" at some minor game like shiratori or fishing. She eventually saw Shukichi on television and figured it out. After realizing that meijins can make 100,000,000 yen in salary, she desperately tries to reclaim an envelope he left for her, which her ornery building manager had seized. (After Yumi had mistakenly put it in an old magazine and took it out to the trash on the wrong day).\nThe envelope was given to her by Shukichi Haneda, and was said to open it when he had collected all seven. Those seven were figured out to be the seven titles of shogi meijin.\nThe building manager, a shogi fan and a former pickpocket, looked inside the envelope to find the marriage registration form, and made a game that would uncover the 8 digit password for the marriage registration. The game was for the purpose to challenge Yumi, whom he called 'ChaCha', and to find if she was worthy of being Shukichi's wife.\n",
    "People": "- 68 years old\n- Condo caretaker\n- Former pickpocket\n- Shogi fan\n- TV announcer\n",
    "Resolution": "Meanwhile, Shukichi lost the last game and therefore was unable to acquire the seventh Meijin title. He then called Yumi to cancel the proposal. An angry Yumi then shredded the marriage registration form into pieces, all the while pretending not to know what was in the envelope, shouting to him so that he would try to get the seventh Meijin title the next time. However, Yumi was unaware that the title match only occurs once a year.\nKohji was mentioned by Shukichi to Yumi Miyamoto on the phone. Shukichi says that he respected Kohji, and Kohji's motto was \"one should stick with one's original plan\".\n",
    "Manga to Anime changes": "- Unlike in the manga in both episodes of the anime when the marriage registration is showned it's displayed in its entirety, showing information that would be revealed later in the manga.\n",
    "Trivia": "- In the episode's intro segment, a scene from the zombie film appearing in A Cottage Surrounded by Zombies is broadcast on the public screen.\n- Koroku Hachitsuka (八塚 虎六)'s name comes from Hachisuka Masakatsu (蜂須賀 正勝), XVIth century feudal lord and ally of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, known by his common name \"Koroku\" (小六).[1]\n",
