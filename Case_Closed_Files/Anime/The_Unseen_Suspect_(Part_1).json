    "Situation": "Kogoro Mouri was invited to make an introduction in an episode of a popular detective TV serial. The star of the show, Yoshiki Kazami, revealed himself to be very disagreeable with the rest of the cast. One of them, Ruri Ujo, turns out to be a fellow classmate of Kogoro when they were children. Ruri revealed to Ran and Conan that she, Kogoro, and Kisaki, had been classmates since kindergarten. Ran and Conan learn that the brainy Kisaki and the underachiever Kogoro seemed inexplicably drawn to each other to quarrel. As the other classmates suspected, time showed that the arguments were intended to disguise their mutual attraction. Yoshiki challenged Kogoro to solve the mystery of the murder scene being filmed. To prevent Kogoro from embarrassing himself, Conan used the tranquilizer dart on Kogoro and cracked the puzzle with the clues present. During a break in the filming, Yoshiki is discovered dead.\n\nNo murder weapon could be found at the scene. The immediate suspects were the other members of the cast, including Ruri and the Nagumo father-son.\n",

    "Resolution": "Akira slit Yoshiki's throat by using a box-cutter blade. It was speculated beforehand that none of the bladed objects at the film set could be used as a weapon because all Luminol tests were negative, and none of them (excluding the box cutter blade) are long enough to cause a 10 cm indentation. However, the blood splatter could be negated by wrapping the weapon using duct tape, and the blade can be hidden by breaking it into tiny 2 cm pieces. The blade fragments were then hidden in the interior of a lighter. The cotton inside the mechanism was removed and taped onto the floor along with the rest of the duct tape to hide it, as the floor had been spiked earlier with tape for the film shoot.\nThe evidence that seals Akira's guilt is that he is the only person aside Mouri who would use a lighter as a hiding place, having once been a heavy smoker. It is further speculated that the crime was committed at the spur of the moment, since none of the items used in the crime had been prepared in advance. The method used to hide the murder weapon is impossible to do while wearing gloves, so fingerprints of some sort will definitely be found upon further inspection.\n",
    "Trivia": "- In the second part of the case, the opening was changed to Kaze no Lalala.\n",
