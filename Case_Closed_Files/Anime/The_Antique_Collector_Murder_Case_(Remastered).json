    "Situation": "\n",
    "People": "- Victim (stabbed)\n- 51 years old\n- Maru Group chairman\n- 34 years old\n- Denjiro's wife\n- 37 years old\n- Beika Hospital doctor\n- Denjiro's attending physician\n- 48 years old\n- Engraver\n- 46 years old\n- Suwa Dojo instructor\n- Maru's house staff\n- Maru's house staff\n",
    "Resolution": "Using his gadgets to tranquilize Kogoro, Conan reveals that the killer is Yuji Suwa.\nWhile Suwa was fiddling with the answering machine to prove he wasn't the killer, with the last of his strength, Denjiro wrote Suwa's name on the drawers using the katana Suwa used to cut him in the first place as a dying message to prove he was the killer. When Suwa noticed this, he shuffled the drawers then added a few more markings so it couldn't be recognized, and marked the rest of the room so it wouldn't stand out, to erase a dying man’s message from the police's eyes.\n\nSuwa then charged at Kogoro with a sword to kill him, but stopped just when the sword was about to hit deep into Kogoro's head. Suwa claims Kogoro must be very brave to just stay still in the face of death. After Suwa was arrested however, Kogoro finally wakes up and notices a tiny drip of blood on his head and freaks out.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "Because this one episode case was adapted from four manga chapters, several scenes were shortened or removed.\n- In the manga, Denjiro is shouting a couple times for someone to greet the visitor at the door before realizing he gave the staff time off and sent them out due to having a detective over. Kogoro asks if his wife was told to leave as well with Denjiro mentioning that she left at noon for a Koto lesson, though he's disbelieving due to the photo. Afterwards, he leaves to greet his visitor while mentally cursing Ineko. In the anime, Denjiro simply calls for someone to answer the door once before realizing that his staff is out and simply goes to greet the visitor.\n- In the manga, Conan also points out that the culprit must escaped through the backgate after committing the murder, this part it omitted in the anime.\n- In the manga, Conan and Ran realize that Hatano was lying about watching movie \"The Santa Claus of Summer\" during the time of murder, and Ineko reveals shortly afterward that she has been having an affair with him, providing their affair disguises as evidences. In the anime, Conan tips off Kogoro immediately about Hatano having the same perfume smell as Ineko, with Kogoro announcing that Hatano is Ineko's affair partner instead of Ineko herself.\n- In the manga, Conan temporary removes Suwa from the suspect list along side Kogoro due to him supposedly being framed before the resolution. This is not the case in the anime where he still considers Suwa as a suspect.\n",
