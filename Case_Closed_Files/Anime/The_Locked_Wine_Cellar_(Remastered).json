    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan are invited to a private party by a president of a financial business, Shohei Kusaka, who is known for his expensive collection and various tastes in wine. Three other guests have attended: Takeo Nonaka, Jyokichi Tonomura, and Yukari Takano. All of whom have borrowed money from the president. Kusaka challenges Tonomura to a tasting challenge: if Tonomura guesses all of the wines correctly, Kusaka will forget his debt. As Tonomura guesses two of the wines correctly, the president gets frustrated and goes to his wine cellar for a rare wine. After taking a break, they all realize that the president has taken too long to return. Toshiko and Kogoro go to check on him, Conan following behind, and they discover his body in the wine cellar.\n\nConan takes notice of the victim's odd position on the floor. During the investigation, it is discovered that Shohei and his wife, Toshiko, are the only ones with the keys to the wine cellar, which was locked. In addition, the window could only be opened from the inside, and has a security alarm so it can't be forced open.\nBased on what was found so far, the culprit should still be in the house. Fingerprints have been found on the door by two of the suspects, Tonomura and Takano. Nonaka went outside and never touched the door, and Toshiko was in the kitchen and couldn't leave without passing by Kogoro's group. Conan puts the pieces together, and uses Kogoro with the aid of Takagi and Chiba to reenact how the criminal killed the president.\n",
