    "Situation": "Ran, Sonoko, and Conan are invited to the opening ceremony of a chocolate shop that is supported by the Suzuki Group. They meet a woman named Mayuko Sakura, the shop producer. Next they meet a man named Yukihiko Tsujimoto, the chocolatier and he's Mayuko's fiancé. During Tsujimoto's show, the fire breaks out in the shop, killing Tsujimoto. Was this a terrible accident or a planned murder? Inspector Yuminaga, as a pathetic naive, considers Conan only a noise on the crime scene.\n\n",
    "People": "- 25 years old\n- Shop producer\n- Victim (burned)\n- 41 years old\n- Chocolatier\n- Mayuko's fiancé\n- Tokyo MPD forensics officer\n",
    "Resolution": "The fire was caused by a practically applied principle which makes air batteries create electricity: a chemical reaction between aluminum foil placed at the bottom of the swan piece's silver bowl, with a layer of steel wool above it, and salt water in the teapot. The fire was triggered when the self-samely created electricity flowed through the steel wool, igniting it and, consequently, the fruit liquor. The original intention was to have fresh water meet and dissolve a piece of dry ice to create a mist effect.\nIn addition, Sakura had prepared some additional means of making the fire spread rapidly: pistachio shells placed underneath the liquor bottles on the shelf to make them topple over more easily, and a paper bowl with spirytus, a highly concentrated vodka brand. The latter was hidden beneath the table on which the demonstration of the chocolate swan was to take place, and the volatile fumes from the alcohol were kept in check by the tablecloth until it was lifted by Sakura, releasing the vapors and thereby making the fire go wild. The only reason that Sakura's sleeve caught fire was because while she was fixing the tablecloth, part of the alcohol splashed onto her sleeve.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The police make reference to Spirytus or Rectified spirit, an almost pure alcoholic drink containing at least 95% ABV (Alcohol by Volume), and is prone to flammability.\n- This case includes the aluminium-air battery technique.\n"
