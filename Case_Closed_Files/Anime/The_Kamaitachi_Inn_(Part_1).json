    "Situation": "It started when they are going to Kamaitachi Inn. Heiji asked Kogoro to investigate the Kamaitachi who've been lurking at the inn. The culprit's weapon is a scythe or a sickle. Hattori said that the Kamaitachi rides on whirlwinds and cuts people clean in half. And they were shocked except Kazuha, Conan and Heiji. The hot springs were at the outdoor's inn. The photo was taken by the same angle by the writer who published this photo and it was a man. And it was Nakama Daigo, writer for IZUNA's magazine. He was here to take photo of the Kamaitachi.\nMidori Koyanagi said that the Kamaitachi never existed in the first place. And then the boy named Kohei Ono witness the running of the Kamaitachi and it was very fast. He tried to chase him, but he can't walk on water. He was almost drowned and couldn't move like a spell or a magic. When he woke up, he was lying down the hallway, soaking wet. The landlord. Bonzo Ono said that only monsters can make customers come-in everyday just to see the Kamaitachi. The blade or sickle is about 60 cm long. Midori Koyanagi wants to buy it, and they found the sickle on the warehouse. And suddenly, the hands of Hattori and Kogoro were bleeding cause by the sickle and then the booming of the bulb.\nThe worst is Midori Koyanagi was cut onto her cheek and it was attempted murder, and they thought it was the Kamaitachi's doing.\n\n\n\nInspector Yamamura said that the Kamaitachi never exist. When they go to the warehouse, the inspector thought that Daigo Nakama was the one slashed them with a sickle. They know what's the weapon, but they don't know how did the bulb boom. And they found Bubble gum and etc.\n\nAnother incident, Bonzo Ono was found dead in a room, the murder weapon is a sickle. They found him at the annex, and the victim was lying down when he was dead. The reason why the balloon was popped up because of BB pellets scattered around the floor. Kazuha said that the popping of the balloons were at the same time. But the BB pellets were only three. And Conan smell something, Ran said that there are still glass shards all over the floor. The strange smell is a cleaning detergent, and then he said that it was cold because it got covered in rainwater or something. And then they heard about the head chef who was throw off, but she didn't know, she only heard about it when she was married into the family. And they solve the case without a doubt.\n",
    "People": "- 35 years old\n- Writer\n- Victim (slashed - injured)\n- 26 years old\n- Writer\n- 7 years old\n- Landlady's son\n- 34 years old\n- Inn's landlady\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- 72 years old\n- Landlady's father-in-law\n- Gunma reporter\n- Filmed a show about the Kamaitachi Inn\n- Gunma Prefectural Police CSI officer\n",
    "Resolution": "In the post-credit segment of the episode, Kazuha and Ran approach Heiji for his \"confession\" about his actual feelings for Kazuha, but Heiji claims that they have merely misheard: Instead of \"ore no Kazuha\" (\"my Kazuha\"), he had said \"onore\" (\"Damn you!\"). The reason for Heiji's denial is that - much like the way Shinichi did in London - he simply wants to wait for the right place and time to make his actual love confession.\n",
