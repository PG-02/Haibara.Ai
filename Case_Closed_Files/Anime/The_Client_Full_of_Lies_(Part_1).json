    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "A woman named Shizuka Ikenami asks Kogoro to help find a man named Shiro Shibata so she could retrieve an old photograph; Conan realizes that the Ikenami is lying to Kogoro when she introduces herself for unknown reasons. Realizing that Shiro was skilled with kendo, Conan assumes that his name would show up in past kendo competitions. After finding an address, they enter Shiro's apartment and find out Shiro has been murdered.\n\n",
    "People": "- 42 years old\n- Kogoro's client\n- Victim (beaten)\n- 42 years old[1]\n- Physical education teacher\n- 47 years old\n- Shiro's friend\n- 38 years old\n- Shiro's wife\n- Shizuoka Prefectural Police Department forensics officer\n- Shizuoka Prefectural Police Department forensics officer\n- Medical examiner\n",
    "Resolution": "- Because of the time frame between the murder and its discovery, Conan removes Shizuka and Yoshikawa from the suspect list. If Shizuka did murder Shiro, fled the crime scene, and went to hire Kogoro in order to create an alibi as the first to discover the body, then she should have known that the door wasn't locked and would’ve used it as an excuse to get everyone inside to the crime scene, not to stall the discovery time and the time of death further. Moveover, it's unlikely for her to not have noticed the photo in the victim's hand and retrieve it, since it would've been an incriminating piece of evidence against her. Likewise, Yoshikawa had a large amount of time to dispose of possible evidence(s) against him, and had no need to return to the crime scene after almost half the day had passed, and even if that's the case, it's unlikely for him to keep the arrived Kogoro and the rest from leaving if he wanted to sneak into the crime scene.\n- Conan reveals that Kyoko falsified Shiro's time of death by placing the morning newspaper by Shiro's late night supper after she returned from the golf club in order to pretend it was breakfast, and by using a timed video cassette recorder to record a show the time of murder would be shifted to during the morning, thus she would be removed from the suspect list due to having an alibi during the time frame. Kyoko originally intended to become the first discoverer of the body, but after she heard a message from Yoshikawa she decided to let him play the role instead of her. She hid inside the emergency exit until the time came and pretended that she had just returned from the golf club.\n- Conan reveals that the photo of Shizuka was used to hide Shiro's real dying message, his wedding ring covered in blood in his right hand, which he noticed after seeing the ring mark on his palm. After she successfully removed the ring, Kyoko knocked down the photo album to make it appeared that Shiro used his last strength to grab the photo. Failing to put the ring back in Shiro's finger, she used bandages to cover the ring mark and took the ring with her, planning to dispose of it after the police left. The fact that she is in possession of the bloodied ring is solid proof that she is the murderer of her own husband.\n",
    "Motive": "Kyoko confesses and reveals that Shiro was addicted to gambling in Mahjong with Yoshikawa, causing them to fall in debt and forcing them to sell many of their possessions such as their television, jewelry, LD player, etc. When she heard that he had decided to sell her set of golf clubs and the dowry given to them by her father as their wedding gift she was forced to kill him. Before being taken by the police, Kyoko asks to change her clothes first, Conan realizes that the dowry she meant was in fact a katana that she was trying to use to commit suicide.\n\nConan rushes over and opens the door revealing Kyoko with the Katana, she threatens them and tells them to stay away. However Shizuka tells them to leave this to her and she pulls out her folding fan while slowly walking towards Kyoko. Kyoko swings the katana wildly but shizuka manages to block it with her fan at the same time swiftly disarming Kyoko in an instant.\nShizuka reprimands Kyoko for trying to take another life, however Kyoko confused says that she was trying to take her own life. But Shizuka calls her a fool stating that every life is valuable including hers and that she should not take these things lightly. Kyoko willingly surrenders and remains quiet as she is taken away by inspector Yokomizo. After Kyoko is taken away, Conan asks Shizuka about her true identity after noticing that she had lied to them four times:\n- If she has dust allergy, it's unlikely that her hobby is knitting with yarn.\n- She easily identified the fish in the victim's meal by it’s slices, meaning that she is skilled at cooking.\n- Coincidentally, like Kyoko, Shizuka hides the fact that she is married by covering her wedding ring mark with bandages.\n- There is no character named Reiko in the novel, as what she was referring to at the café was actually Rei-Co (冷コー) or Ice Coffee. She wanted to order the said drink, but relented as only Osakan would call Ice Coffee by that term.\n",
