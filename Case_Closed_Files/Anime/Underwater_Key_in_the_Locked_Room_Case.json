    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan pay a visit to an old woman, who had meet Kogoro when he was a student. She decides to take them to her grandson, but he's found dead when they get into the house. The front door is locked however. How could this have happened? Rather than use Sleeping Kogoro for the case, Conan solves this one as himself.\n\n",
    "People": "- 73 years old\n- Hikari Maison landlady\n- Kogoro's old friend\n- Victim (wrist slit)\n- 22 years old\n- Mitsue's grandson\n- Jonan University architecture student 4th year\n- 22 years old\n- Makoto's friend\n- Jonan University medical student 4th year\n",
    "Resolution": "After locking the front door, he attached the key to a beetle with a string made of toilet paper and dropped it through the mail slot. He put a sweater on the front door tiles so that the beetle could walk more easily. He covered the top of the model with a scent that attracts male beetles in order to guide the beetle. As it walked across the bridge, the key fell into the model's moat and the string melted, leaving the key behind. The beetle would then fly out of the room through a window, attracted to the light outside. In this manner, he was able to create a locked room.\nThe proof is Yoshihiko's handkerchief, which was covered in Mitsue's homemade juice that she brought to the apartment that afternoon. While in the apartment, he had cleaned it up earlier to keep the beetle from being distracted by the juice's strong scent.\n"
