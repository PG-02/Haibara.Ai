    "Situation": "Conan and the Detective Boys go to a Beika coffee shop to meet up with Professor Agasa. Nearby, Ohara and Aida are having a meeting. Ohara gets up to go to the bathroom, and while he's gone, a truck slammed into the coffee shop and crushed Aida who is still seated. Conan realizes it wasn't the negligence of the driver but a murder.\n\n",
    "People": "- 52 years old\n- Ohara Planning Corp president\n- Victim (crushed)\n- 35 years old\n- Ohara Planning Corp designer\n- Beika policeman\n- Beika policeman\n- 25 years old\n- \"Haido Unsou\" delivery truck driver\n- 46 years old\n- Ohara Planning Corp secretary\n- Peach Sunday's owner\n- Peach Sunday's waitress\n",
    "Resolution": "- The cut on Ohara's finger, as a result of the piano chord. Blood from the cut was found on the windowsill.\n- A piano wire was used to attach the stop to the back of a bus.\n- When Genta knocked on the bathroom door, there was no reply, indicating Ohara wasn't in the bathroom.\n- A wooden stop was found, which served to stop the truck.\n- A glove was found inside Ohara's car with blood on the same spot as the cut on Ohara's hand.\nOhara killed Aida because he had supposedly forgotten the favors. He owed Ohara and threatened to quit the company. This would have resulted in the company's bankruptcy. So, Ohara decided to kill Aida in order to collect the insurance money. Furthermore, Aida spoke of collecting large sums of money before quitting.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The coffee shop Peach Sunday reappears in a three years ago's case from Magic File 2.\n- The ambulance with license plate number 新宿 88, せ 41-67 (Shinjuku 88, Se 41-67) is the same from The Bank Robber's Hospitalization Case and The Traveling Drama Troupe Murder Case (Part 1), but this time there is a mistake with 33, instead 88.\n- In The Trembling Police Headquarters: 12 Million Hostages, an \"Haido Unsou\" delivery truck had killed the culprit's accomplice in an accident seven years ago.\n"
