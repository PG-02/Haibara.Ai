    "Resolution": "It turns out Haru Kamogawa is trying to scam Kazama instead of her being scammed by him. The proof is when Kazama took his coat off because of the hot temperature inside Haru's limousine and went to the bank to claim the money, she hacked into Kazama's bank accounts using his phone and withdrew all of Kazama's money. Kamogawa defends herself by saying that she even doesn't know what a smartphone is, but Conan says that the glasses she wears help to block blue light from digital devices, indicating that she uses smartphones and computers. She finally confesses how she wants to avenge her friend who was tricked by Kazama and died six months ago. She left her ring to her friend after Kazama took everything from her. She also reveals that its her first time doing a scam, and that she never did something illegal and also how she \"studied\" to prepare it, like knowing how to use a computer and also she says to Conan that he got so much potential to be a good detective, and when the police, Ran and Sonoko arrives, she also apologizes to the girls and the money Joji scammed will probably be returned to all of his victims.\n- Deceased\n- Haru's friend\n- Yuki's victim\n"
