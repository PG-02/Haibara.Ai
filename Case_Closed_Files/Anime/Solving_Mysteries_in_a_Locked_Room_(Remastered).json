    "Resolution": "Kogoro deduces that the man who attempted to murder Azuma was his own secretary, Haruhiko Kasai. Conan then puts Kogoro to sleep and presents the rest of his deduction. Kasai's sister had got scored a well-paid job at a bank. Benkichi Yamanami threatened him to kill Azuma or he would have revealed his underhanded acts, depriving his sister of her job.\nHowever, this seems to be a plot written by Kana Tomurai from Nichuiri Television to fool Kogoro and acted by the members of a drama club. This was the reason Azuma was hesitating involve the police in this matter.\nKana Tomurai wanted to avenge the death of Takashi Utsubo. She tried to kill Kogoro with a gun. The dynamite which was fitted in one of the drama club's members was also not a prop. She threatened to blow him up if they tried to fail her plan. Finding no other choice, Conan resorts pleading, crying and begging Kana not to kill Kogoro, trying to emotionally manipulate her in every possible way to buy him enough time to fill up a PET bottle with water. With her guard down, he threw the PET bottle at her, disrupting her balance, climbing her and tackling her to the ground, also stealing the gun alongwith. The drama club members then prevented her escape by forcing her to the ground. The police are called and she is arrested.\n\n\n",
