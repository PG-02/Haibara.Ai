    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan find a cat belonging to a rich British woman who offers to pay their expenses on a trip to London so Kogoro could share his detective stories with her friends. To get past airport security, Haibara gives Conan two antidotes to the APTX 4869 for the trip and the way back home. At the Holmes Museum, Ran calls Shinichi asking him if he wants a souvenir from London. His weak reaction causes Ran to angrily hang up. Outside the museum, a kid named Apollo Glass asks to see Holmes' Apprentice to solve a code that will prevent a person from being murdered. Conan offers to solve the riddle by posing as Holmes' Apprentice. Apollo reveals a strange man gave him a note containing seven coded riddles, declaring someone in London will die if it is left unsolved. They learn from the police that many children have received the same code which Conan speculates to mean a large number of people will die. Conan and Agasa separate themselves from the group as they attempt to decode the riddles.\nRan, feeling upset as she believes Shinichi does not return her feelings, is confronted by Apollo's sister, pro tennis player Minerva Glass. Minerva then parts ways with Ran advising her that \"Love is Zero\" (a pun referencing that the term \"Love\" is used in Tennis to denote a zero score) and would never amount to anything no matter the effort. Ran calls Shinichi for advice on the riddles. Conan, tells Ran the first riddle \"A rolling bell rises me\", refers to Big Ben and accidentally reveals he is in London. Realizing Ran will discover Conan's true identity if she finds him, Conan and Agasa flee from her. Conan becomes cornered in a phone booth and is forced to take the antidote, APTX 4869, for the return trip and confronts Ran as Shinichi. Ran confesses her pain of liking Shinichi who is indifferent to her feelings and runs away as Shinichi is left chasing after her.\nThe next day, the police reveal the identity of the man who created the note, Hades Sabara. Shinichi's research on Hades Sabara shows him, an originally good person, turned a cold-blooded serial killer after his mother died. He had previously murdered people who hound him for money and his friends whom advised him to invest on stock market. On the run, Hades met a woman named Hestia who was an expert in bombing, but apparently had committed suicide.\n\n\n\nKogoro and Ran decode the riddle \"My portion is like a chilled boiled egg like a corpse\" which refers to City Hall. There, they find many dolls with \"Mazarin Stone\" written on their shirts where when beheaded, reveals the letter \"T\". The riddle \"I finished up with a whole pickle\" refers to 30 St Mary Axe where they found scratched up pens labeled as Dancing Men reveal the letter \"N\". At Big Ben, Ran and Kogoro find an arrow pointing to a drain where The Valley of Fear of fear is inscribed. They deduce from the story that something had been sunk in the river, and find a drain cover with the letter \"A\". Apollo leads the two to the next riddle, \"Now I remember to ask a cake to celebrate in advance\" referring to St. Bride's Church where they find letters entitled, \"A Scandal in Bohemia\". Soaking the letter in water reveals the letter \"S\".\nShinichi has returned to Conan again. However Haibara had only given him two pills, he will have to figure something out. Conan, Agasa and Kogoro continue to chronicle Hades' action, revealing \nHades also bombed two hospitals that refused to treat her mother, causing heavy casualties, and sent video clips to Scotland Yard afterward. Curiously, in both cases, he sent cryptic advance notice to the police to challenge him solving the cases.\n\n\nIt means to apprehend him this time, they have to solve the riddle, and approach him without his knowledge. Gradually deciphering the note handed out by the criminal, Conan discovers that the place where he plans to attack will be at Wimbledon, where Minerva Glass is supposed to be playing. When they reach the stadium, the criminal has already entered, and since they do not have tickets, they stay outside. However, they can watch the game from a screen that is located outside of Wimbledon at Murray Mound. Minerva has lost the first set 0-6 and is losing on the second set. Remarkably; however, her serves are flawless: although she keeps hitting \"let\" services, she stays remarkably consistent in serving. It seems Hades is targeting her and she is trying to relay some message to the audience.\nMinerva is losing because she's writing a message in braille by hitting the ball on the lawn, which Conan understood. He convinces Apollo to give him his ticket. When he enters the stadium, he spots a written slip of paper in Minerva's wristband, but could not read it. He tells Minerva that he can help, proclaiming himself as \"Holmes Apprentice\", which Minerva believes in and starts relaying the message, also using Braille letters. The message is \"GAME, SET, DEATH, MOM\" which shows Hades actually targets Minerva's mother, Juno Glass.\n\nConan focuses on finding Hades and asks Minerva to lengthen the game. Minerva gets to play and the party has to decide in the tie-break.\nSee resolution\n",

    "Resolution": "Conan meets his parents and is given a ticket to enter the box that Hades is sitting. After locates Hades with the help of Minerva, bystanders see Conan as \"Holmes Apprentice\" and compliment him and then Hades sees him. Before even pressing the button to trigger the bomb, Minerva throws a tennis ball and hits Hades. After that, Conan then takes the ball and kicks it. It hits Hades and he got stopped by the police.\nThe suspicious woman is Yukiko Kudo in disguise, and Hestia indeed died from the explosion. It turns out Yukiko has ran around London in disguise to help Conan, Ran, and Kogoro solving the code. She and her husband, Yusaku Kudo, also help Conan at the Wimbledon by having Scotland Yard's police ready to apprehend the culprit, and reserving tickets for Conan in all possible gates. It is shown aftermath that Yusaku has already figured who the culprit is, but could not approach him since the culprit remembers Yusaku's face.\nAs the audience was giving a standing ovation for Minerva, Mouri Kogoro realizes in horror that the woman who sponsored his trip is from the royal family, and in a dinner he apparently threw an English prince to the floor by his one-arm shoulder throw.\nMinerva wins the match and meets with Ran. She says Shinichi told her that the zero is also a starting point.\nIn the post credit, it was shown that Yusaku and Yukiko came to London following Haibara's request. Knowing Shinichi will use an antidote for Ran's sake, Haibara gave Shinichi's parents an extra pill. Shinichi remarked if Haibara could read his mind, she should have given him 100 pills, which Agasa comments that he did not learn the lesson (refer to the scene in The Blue Spark of Hate).\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga, when Conan accepts Diana's invitation to visit her in London, Azusa Enomoto mentions in an obviously stunned manner that Conan can speak English, an observation also made by Ran. [1] In the anime, while still taking place in the Café Poirot, Azusa is completely omitted from the scene. Instead, Kogoro takes over her role of noticing Conan's ability to speak English. [2]\n- In the manga, Hades Sabara's past is elaborated on in more detail. Shinichi reads online that after his mother died, Hades invited the acquaintances hounding him for money to his house where he slaughtered them all. One week later, he went to the home of the friend who suggested he invest in the stock market; not only did Hades murder the entire family, but he ripped out all of their hearts. While the online source did not explain the reason behind such brutality, Shinichi speculated that his mother's serious disease could have been related to the heart. [3] The anime only states that Sabara killed these people. [4] The omission is likely due to the dark nature of the crimes and the gruesome background panel accompanying the story of Sabara's past in the manga, an image which was likely too graphic for animation.\n- Many dialogues during the scenes at Wimbledon was changed from English to Japanese in the anime, including the conversation between Juno, Apollo, and Ares, and Hades Sabara's monologues.\n",
    "Trivia": "- It should be noted that characters inside the arc were named after the Roman and Greek gods.\nDiana Kingstone - Diana, refers to the Roman counterpart of Artemis, the Greek God of the wild and hunt. Her name may also be an allusion to Princess Diana.\nVenus - Venus, the Roman counterpart of Aphrodite, the Greek Goddess of beauty and love.\nMinerva Glass - Minerva, the Roman counterpart of Athena, the Greek Goddess of war.\nApollo Glass - Apollo, the God of the sun, medicine, archery, music and poetry.\nAres Ashley - Ares, the Greek God of war.\nHades Sabara - Hades, the Greek God of the underworld and death.\nHestia - Hestia, the Goddess of the hearth\nJuno Glass - Juno, the Roman counterpart of Hera, Goddess of family and fertility, Queen of the Gods\nDemeter Bauer - Demeter, the Greek Goddess of agriculture.\n- Diana Kingstone - Diana, refers to the Roman counterpart of Artemis, the Greek God of the wild and hunt. Her name may also be an allusion to Princess Diana.\n- Venus - Venus, the Roman counterpart of Aphrodite, the Greek Goddess of beauty and love.\n- Minerva Glass - Minerva, the Roman counterpart of Athena, the Greek Goddess of war.\n- Apollo Glass - Apollo, the God of the sun, medicine, archery, music and poetry.\n- Ares Ashley - Ares, the Greek God of war.\n- Hades Sabara - Hades, the Greek God of the underworld and death.\n- Hestia - Hestia, the Goddess of the hearth\n- Juno Glass - Juno, the Roman counterpart of Hera, Goddess of family and fertility, Queen of the Gods\n- Demeter Bauer - Demeter, the Greek Goddess of agriculture.\n- It is revealed that on Ran's phone some of her contacts include Sumiko Kobayashi, Genta Kojima, and some miscellaneous people who have not made an appearance in the Detective Conan franchise as of yet.\n- The anime makes a mistake in displaying the score before Minerva relayed the message. It was shown correctly in the manga that the score was 0-6 and 0-2.\n- The message \"GAME, SET, DEATH, MOM\" that the culprit sent to Minerva, was relayed in a single game in Minerva's turn, ending at Minerva's favor and she reduced the deficit to 1-3. Writing the message in Braille, including break between words, requires 44 services from Minerva. Given \"let\" services (balls hitting the net, requiring server to serve again) also counts towards writing the message, it is quite a long game but not impossible to achieve, especially given Minerva tries to stall this particular game.\n- The sports cap Minerva is wearing has a logo similar to Babolat's, a french company specialized in making equipment for tennis, badminton and squash, which's logo is shaped the same style as the one on her cap.\n- The London two-story buses are AEC Routemasters.\n- Diana Kingstone - Diana, refers to the Roman counterpart of Artemis, the Greek God of the wild and hunt. Her name may also be an allusion to Princess Diana.\n- Venus - Venus, the Roman counterpart of Aphrodite, the Greek Goddess of beauty and love.\n- Minerva Glass - Minerva, the Roman counterpart of Athena, the Greek Goddess of war.\n- Apollo Glass - Apollo, the God of the sun, medicine, archery, music and poetry.\n- Ares Ashley - Ares, the Greek God of war.\n- Hades Sabara - Hades, the Greek God of the underworld and death.\n- Hestia - Hestia, the Goddess of the hearth\n- Juno Glass - Juno, the Roman counterpart of Hera, Goddess of family and fertility, Queen of the Gods\n- Demeter Bauer - Demeter, the Greek Goddess of agriculture.\n",
