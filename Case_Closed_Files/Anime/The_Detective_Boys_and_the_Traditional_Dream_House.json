    "Resolution": "Akito Haga is the culprit behind a robbery eight years ago. His motive for buying the house was to retrieve the money he had stolen and buried in the backyard. After realizing the money was used by the previous owner and was likely the source for the gardener killing his spouse, he becomes disgruntled. After Akari finds out about his motive, he tries to kill her, which was part of his original plan.\n\n\n",
    "Aftermath": "After the case is concluded, we learn that Akari moved out, which the Detective Boys say is understandable, since so much happened with the house. As they are saying this, a couple walks by the back-on-sale kominka and become interested in buying it since it must have some history with it. Genta decides he will gladly tell them about the history, but is held back the other Detective Boys, while Conan says to himself that that information must be disclosed to buyers anyways.\n",
