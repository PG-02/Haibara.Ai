    "Situation": "Kogoro goes undercover at Beika Sports Center: stalking a man named Shoichiro Hitomi who is negotiating with a rich man by the swimming pool. After the negotiation failed, the man enters the sport club's restroom while Kogoro receives a call from Ran and Conan. The two informs him that since he won't be back for the lunch, they decide to go and have \"cheap and unlimited buffet\" by themselves at Viking which causes Kogoro's stomach to growl. At the same time, the target exits the restroom with a serious expression, worrying Kogoro. He follows Mr. Hitomi to Beika Hotel and witnesses him calling someone with a payphone. However, he runs into Ran and Conan who informs him that they are having lunch at the hotel. The three spy on Mr.Hitomi who repeatedly glances at the reception when a young woman asks the employee if he has a package from a man named Manabu Anzai. Later, as Ran and Conan are eating in the restaurant, they witness Mr.Hitomi falling off the building.\n\nThe police soon arrive and take away Mr. Hitomi's body. Kogoro summarizes the situation before the accident to Megure: he was riding the elevator with the victim and Minamizato when the victim left on the ninth floor. Kogoro quickly followed him to the stairway and witnessed him forcing his way into Minamizato's room and attacked her. He broke the door down and saw the unconscious Minamizato on the floor and Hitomi attempting to escape through the balcony. The man slipped, and fell to his doom.\n\nMegure interrogates Minamizawa who denies having any connection with her attacker/the victim. They find out that the last person who made a call with the victim was his sister-in-law, Kanako, at 11:20 AM. Afterwards, Minamizawa asks the group to leave. At the lobby, Conan points out that despite having a mobile phone, the victim was using the payphone in the hotel prior to the accident. As they're conversing, Megure arrives and informs the three of the death of Hitomi's twin brother at Haido Mansion.\n\nKogoro reveals that the person who hired him was Takehiko Hitomi as he suspected that his twin brother was impersonating as him and engaging in illegal businesses. He also found out that the man had a huge amount of debt. Although they think that the two cases are separate, they decide to head to the site of murder. The crime scene showed that the murderer broke in through the window to rob the house, and that the house key is a special one that cannot be duplicated easily. They interrogate Kanako, who informs them that she was at Beika City before returning home and witnessing her murdered husband. Kanako reveals that she gave her brother-in-law her spare key and her phone number as she wants them to reconcile after the two fought due to their father's will of leaving the company to Takehiko. She also reveals that she was called to Beika Station by Shoichiro at 12:30 PM but he never came. From the information, they conclude that the two cases are not connected and are just synchronicity. However, Conan still has his doubts about the attempted murder of Minamizato and her unknown connection with the two victims.\nRecalling that Minamizato was at the lobby asking about a package from Anzai, the three head to her room to question her about the man's identity when a man in sunglasses attempted to murder her with an ash tray.\n\nAt the hospital, Minamizato reveals that she was in a relationship with Anzai and they were thinking about marriage. However, she lost all contact with him half a year ago after giving him a huge amount of cash and came to Tokyo to find out about his whereabouts after some people told her that he was last seen in Tokyo. Kogoro concludes that the man must be a gold digger who is only after her money. Also, the picture of Anzai matches with the man Kogoro spotted in the Sports Centre where he tailed Shoichiro, which the fitness instructor reveals that the man also went under another alias known as Tanizaki. They also witness him with another woman who is clearly targeted by him for her money. With this revelation, Conan finally connects the relationships of all the people involved with the two cases and begins the deduction.\n",

    "Trivia": "- Manabu Anzai car driving with lady is a Red 2000 Ford Mustang Cobra GT [SN95] convertible.\n- The pastry shop at Beika Station from The City Crows reappears in the first part.\n- The idea of murder exchange is based on the movie Strangers on a Train, which is a 1951 American psychological thriller film noir. The story concerns two strangers who meet on a train, a young tennis player and a charming psychopath. The psychopath suggests that because they each want to \"get rid\" of someone, they should \"exchange\" murders, and that way neither will be caught. The psychopath commits the first murder, then tries to force the tennis player to complete the bargain.\n",
