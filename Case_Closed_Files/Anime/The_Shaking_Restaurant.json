    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan are all walking and are very hungry, so they stop by at a western restaurant that Kogoro frequently visits, where they meet Shigeru Hanaoka, the owner of \"Karantei\" Restaurant, his wife Reiko Hanaoka, the new waitress Saki Yoshizawa, and the cook Minoru Wada. There is construction work going on next door, so the restaurant constantly shakes from the work, causing spills and broken plates. They go back the next morning only to find Shigeru Hanaoka, who wanted to go swordfish fishing in Hachijou Island after long time, dead.\n\nAt first it looks like the construction made a vase fall over and hit him on the head, killing the owner, however, the construction wasn't happening at the estimated time of death. Could this be more than just an accident?\n",
    "People": "- Victim (bashed)\n- 40 years old\n- \"Karantei\" Restaurant owner\n- Fishing group member\n- 30 years old\n- Shigeru's wife\n- \"Karantei\" Restaurant worker\n- 20 years old\n- \"Karantei\" Restaurant waitress\n- 35 years old\n- \"Karantei\" Restaurant cook\n- Reiko's lover\n- 40 years old\n- Photographer\n- Shigeru's close friend\n- Fishing group member\n- Deceased (illness)\n- Shigeru's first love\n- Saki's mother\n- Kogoro's mahjong friend\n",
    "Resolution": "Yoshizawa confesses and reveals twenty-one years ago, Hanaoka was a fisherman living on Hachijou Island. There, he swore a girl named Aiko Morimura, to share their future together. But Hanaoka said that he wanted to study cooking, so he abandoned Aiko and left the island. Aiko sends him off in silence, not even telling him about her pregnancy. Aiko waited she gave birth to their child alone, and kept waiting Hanaoka's return while bringing up her child. Then, after waiting for so long and suffered all the hardships, she died alone last spring. She's reveals to be the daughter that Hanaoka never known that he has, Saki Morimura.\n",
    "Quotes": "- Sleeping Kogoro:\n. I don't know why I don't know why Hanaoka-san never contacted her, but regardless of what he did in the past, there must have been ways for you to tell him how you feel. Ways other than committing something abominable like murder.  (咲さん、花岡さんが なぜ連絡を取らなかったのか、それは私にも分かりません。しかし、たとえ過去に花岡さんがどういうことをしたとしても—、あなたの気持ちを伝える方法は他にもあったはずだ。殺人という、忌まわしい方法以外にもね。)\n"
