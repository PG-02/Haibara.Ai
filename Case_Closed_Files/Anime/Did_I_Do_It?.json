    "Situation": "\"Did I do it?\" A man who was all sweaty and looked rather unease troubled himself with this question phrase. He had his glasses broken and carried a jacket stained with blood. After hastily running towards the Mouri Detective Agency, he requested Kogoro to find out what he really did last night. After he suppressed his gasps, he began to tell the antecedent slowly: he is called Manabu Sako, and yesterday he screwed up on his work, and his girlfriend also dumped him. He wanted to express himself and embody his anger and sorrow deep in his heart, so he went somewhere and spent the night. During the morning, he discovered that he appeared to have a dump on his head, and he realised that his jakcet was stained with somebody else's blood. In addition to the broken glasses' lens, he suspected himself of doing something terrible. Therefore, he thought finding a detective to unravel the mystery behind all of this might be the wisest choice.\nEven though Kogoro accepted the affair, it was still pretty tough to find the starting point of the investigation. Since this man had lost the memory specifically of that night, but Conan discovered some potential clues in the man's body. For example, on the side of the jacket's sleeve, there were some olive petals stuck onto it; the shoe sole of this man was also contaminated with some pieces of concrete; and lastly, he found a golden-coloured fibre on the man's hand, which had some blood stained in the middle of that fibre. To figure out the actual place that Sako was, Conan shined blacklight from his watch onto the man's palm, and a series of characters appeared: EDEN.[N 1] In reality, it is a nightclub named EDEN that most young people usually go to during the night. Inside the club, though it was closed during the day, they came across the owner of this club, Leila Hata. She had some black blemishes on her clothes. She was also quite astounded when she learned that Sako had lost his memory that night. She then gave the information that Sako stayed at the club all the time, and she even showed two photos to support her statement. One was taken at 11PM, which Sako appeared to be rejoicing in singing and dancing with the other customers; another was taken at 4AM, which Sako was alone, lying on the sofa, and looked rather drunk inside the club. After showing these photos, Hata immediately asked Kogoro to stop nagging her and leave since the case was \"closed\". The explanation for the broken glasses and the blood-stained jacket was probably caused by a trip over by Sako himself on his way home. Despite the majority believing this speculation, Conan was still sceptical about it, as inside the photos Hata showed there was a suspicious point he noticed: in the 11PM photo, the sole of Sako was still intact, but in the second photo, which was taken at 4AM, the concrete appeared on the sole. He said that this was evidence that Sako was out for once during this period. Hata also confessed that it was Sako who requested her to fabricate this false alibi for him, but now, knowing that Sako was in fact out during that night and even dubiously instructed to fabricate an alibi, what did he actually do?\nConan led everyone to a factory nearby the club since there were some concrete grounds there, which could be a possible premise that Sako got the concrete on his sole from. When arriving there, the construction site flagger, whose name is Tetsuo Morozumi, obstructed their passage. But instantly, he recognised Sako right away. However, not from last night; he claimed that he left the factory after 5PM yesterday, so he only saw Sako in the security camera footage this morning. The same went for him; he also could not believe that Sako had lost the memory, especially for that period of time, and he confirmed to him if he really had lost his memory, and Sako admitted. He then showed the camera video taken. Sako indeed appeared in the video, even though his face was rather unclear. And apparently, the video recorded that Sako went straight at midnight and returned back at 2AM. Therefore, if he committed any crime, it must also be within the time range of 0AM to 2AM. After the confirmation from Takagi by Kogoro, they found out that there was an unsolved theft case that took place within that period; however, it was caused by multi-culprits, and no blood was involved, so the coast was cleared for Sako here.\nAt the same time, Sonoko sent Ran a message through her cellphone. It was a funny video of a man hugging a white statue. When they scrutinised it meticulously, the person who did that was precisely Sako! They got there, and Sako tried to recover the \"hugging scenario\", but it did not much with the trivial perceptions he had during the loss of memory span. After that, they met the people who filmed Sako doing that and uploaded it to the internet. Driven by the menance words uttered by Kogoro, he relunctantly showed a video he filmed but did not post it. In the video, he precisely caught Sako walking through the square, with his jakcet stained and his glasses broken as well. And evidently, he was saying phrases like \"I killed him.\" He also said that it happened yesterday at 2AM and gave the direction of where Sako came from at that time. They then found an abandoned building there, and in its yard, they planted an olive tree, so the olive petals Sako had must have been gotten from there. As they entered that building, they saw an old man dead in the corner of the room, with his feet facing towards the wall. On the side of the deceased old man, there was a little fragment of glass that remained, and surprisingly, it matched the missing gap on Sako's glass lens. Seeing this, Sako had somewhat realized and recalled what basically happened that night; according to his reminiscence, he pushed the victim with his own hands, turned around, and fled.\n\nMegure and Takagi were once again responsible for handling this case. They immediately identified the victim's identity; obviously, he was an old man who lived in the nearby apartment alone and always patrolled around the street and told off the drunks and youths that held a passion for partying. After the police had analysed the crime situation, they found out that the deceased was being pushed by the culprit, and the head of the victim hit the pillar in the building, which left a blood trace on the pillar. It was also proven that the culprit exerted a great deal of force on the chest of the victim, as a cruise could be seen on Koba's chest, which probably meant that the culprit pushed Koba brutally when they were murdering Koba. And now Sako has become the prime, or more technically, the only possible candidate for this murder. As most of the evidence pointed solely to himself: the crusie on the chest was checked and confirmed to have Sako's fingerfrints on it; the blood stained on his jacket was also analysed and turned out to be the victim's; he asked the club owner to falsify an alibi; a video filmed with his speech saying \"I killed him\"; and lastly, the estimated time of death of the victim was precisely the time when Sako left the nightclub. All sorts of clues were indicating that Sako had done it. This is probably the simpliest case ever, where all evidence was applied to only one person, but it might also be the most difficult case ever, if Sako is not the culprit?\n",
    "People": "- 38 years old\n- Office worker\n- Suspect\n- 29 years old\n- Club EDEN owner\n- 64 years old\n- Construction site flagger\n- 20 years old\n- Part-time worker\n- Victim (bashed)\n- 76 years old\n- Old man\n",
    "Resolution": "",
    "Sako is innocent": "Kogoro said that it would not make sense if Sako was in fact the culprit, since according to his description, \"he pushed the victim with his own hands, turned around, and fled,\" which already indicated that he was not the culprit from the outset. The victim was lying on the ground with his feet facing the wall, so if Sako had pushed the victim and turned around, what he would see would be a thick, sturdy wall, which was obviously not the exit and not possible for him to flee away. Conan arranged a possible story for all the clues: Sako entered the abandoned building for some reason and saw Koba lying on the floor, beaten. He wanted to save him by doing chest compressions, so he had to press the victim's chest rate to barely save him. This explained why there were fingerprints on Koba's chest. However, this was noticed by the true culprit, who had just killed Koba and beat Sako.\nSako probably had tussled with the true culprit for a while, and he pushed the culprit and was about to turn around and flee, but he eventually got beaten by the culprit as well. This action caused his glasses to break, making the fragment of glass splattered near the corpse, and staining his jacket with Koba's blood. And when Sako woke up, the alcohol and the head blow caused his memory to be lost; thus, he could not remember anything, and he thought he was the actual person who killed Koba. He then returned to the nightclub and drank a lot of alcohol to make himself forget about everything he did.\n\n",
    "\"And Then There Were None\"": "Megure inquired of the sleeping Kogoro who would be the true culprit, and Conan told him the following:\nHata, in fact, had lied to Kogoro that Sako stayed in the EDEN club all night; it might not seem obvious, but she actually could gain an advantage over it. Which was to fabricate herself an alibi too. During the morning, when Kogoro visited her club, Conan sniffed a smell of burnt wood around. And they also saw some black stains on Hata's clothes. On top of that, the two photos she showed Kogoro had another issue. Which was the disappearance of the fire extinguisher. In the 11PM photo, the fire extinguisher was still there, but in the 4AM one, it was gone. It was quite liable that there was a fire at the back of EDEN club, discovering a minor blaze was actually a serious problem, and to hide it, utilizing the fact that Sako lost his memory.\nNevertheless, it means that Leila Hata had an alibi when Sako was missing, so Kogoro excluded her from the suspect list.\nConan then pointed out that there was also something fishy regarding Atsushi. When he met everyone at the square, sharing the video he filmed about Sako hugging the statue, he had his watch on his left wrist. But now, confronting the police, he took it off. The only explanation for this dreadful act would be that the watch did not belong to him. This can be related to the unsolved theft case, which took place from 12AM to 2AM that Takagi formerly revealed. This first caught Conan's attention due to the inconsistency between his clothes and watch. After that, Atsushi took the watch he stole out of his pocket and committed the crime.\nIn other words, Chino Atsushi was one of the thieves involved in that unsolved theft case at that time. But he would not be the culprit either, as the theft location was too far away from the murder scene. Therefore, the culprit is left with...\nRan opened the video in which Sako was hugging the statue and demonstrated to everyone once again. Conan urged the rest to pay extra attention to the crowd in that video. And at the back of the statue, there was a man wearing a fancy yellow costume with curly, round hair. And that person was actually Morozumi, without the construction uniform and helmet.\nHe gave himself right away by saying he recognizes Sako, but the camera video did not embody Sako's face very clearly. In addition, since Sako wore different clothes, it would be impossible for Morozumi to recognize Sako by only viewing the camera video. He also claimed that he left the area after 5PM yesterday, but he actually appeared inside the video. Furthermore, the golden-colored fibre from Sako's body also matched the type of clothes Morozumi was wearing in that video.\nTetsuo Morozumi confessed everything; the motive for killing Koba was because the victim was mocking his golden-colored outfit that night. On the whim, he thus killed Koba inside that abandoned building. But then he encountered Sako, who just happened to pass by. Sako was drunk but still wanted to save Koba by doing chest compressions before he knocked Sako out unconscious.\nMorozumi said that he was also drunk at that time, which is why he decided to kill a person for merely that.\n",

    "Trivia": "- This is the first Detective Conan case title (excluding OVAs) expressed with a question mark (?) in it. Before this, it only contained titles with exclamation marks (!).\n- The photo taken by the club owner at 4AM, has the same date as this episode's broadcasting date, which is the 16th of September.\n",
    "Quotes": "- Sleeping Kogoro:\nDon't blame the alcohol! Sako-san was drunk like you, but he tried to save someone, while you tried to kill him. Your true natures were revealed by drink. That's all that happened here.  (酒のせいにするんじゃない！同じように酒に酔っていても、酒匂さんは人を救おうとし、あなたは人を殺めた。酒に酔ってその人の本質が出た。ただそれだけのことですよ。)\n",
