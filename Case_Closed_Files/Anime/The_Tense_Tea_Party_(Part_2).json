    "Situation": "Kogoro Mouri heads home carrying a ton of prizes from playing pachinko, only to pick up a note from Ran stating that Eri Kisaki is undergoing surgery in Haido Central Hospital. Kogoro charges towards the hospital but sees that Eri had just woken up from her surgery. She kicks him out of her room, and Conan, who had been watching Eri with Ran, follows him.\nUpon getting kicked out, Kogoro coincidentally meets up with Tooru Amuro, who is in the hospital to re-investigate the truth behind Shuichi Akai's death. Tooru asks Conan if he knew someone named Rikumichi Kusuda, a deceased Black Organization member; unfortunately, Conan makes up a bad lie, so Tooru finds out that Conan does know Rikumichi.\nMeanwhile, Reina Suto, Katsuki Beppu, Tokie Happo, and Juri Kosaka (a hospital patient) are having a tea party, and a case happens.\n\nThe police interrogates each on the suspects one by one which reveals their possible motive; Tokie's former boyfriend was stolen by Reina and became her current husband, Katsuki lost large amount of money because of the stock that Reina recommended, and Juri's son failed an exam because he caught a cold from Reina's son. The three of them denies wanting to kill the victim, since it is not possible to switch a teacup with different colors to poison her.\n",
    "People": "- 41 years old\n- Juri's Visitor\n- 42 years old\n- Juri's Visitor\n- 42 years old\n- Hospitalized patient\n- Victim (poison)\n- 42 years old\n- Juri's visitor\n- Reina's son\n- Juri's son\n- Tsuneo's classmate\n- Hospital visitor\n- Hospital visitor\n- Boy's mother\n",
    "Resolution": "During the time that the three friends were looking at Reina's cellphone, Juri switched her own Butterfly Pea Tea disguised as Hibiscus Tea with a lemon that she applied poison on the rim in advance with Reina's cup. Afterward, she removes the lemon from the cup and adds baking soda inside to complete the trick. The evidence is a stain of lipstick on her finger, and that her tea contains high amounts of baking soda.\nJuri's motive however, is not only because her son failed an exam due to the fact that he caught a cold from Reina's son (who Reina forced to come study at the Kosaka House to spread his cold to reduce his opponents in the exam), but because she was pregnant at the time. Juri had a miscarriage due to the cold and after hearing the confession from Tsuneo, decided to take revenge for Reina's selfishness.\n",
