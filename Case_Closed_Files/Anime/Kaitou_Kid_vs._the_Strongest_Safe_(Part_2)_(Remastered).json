    "Situation": "Jirokichi Suzuki receives a letter from the thief, Kaitou Kid which reveals that Kid plans on opening Jirokichi's impenetrable safe, the Iron Tanuki.\nThe letter however is not written in Kid's usual style raising the idea that an imposter is after Jirokichi's safe. Sonoko invites Ran, Kogoro, and Conan to Jirokichi's house. After examining the security of the safe, Kaitou Kid's card, in its usual style, is found confirming Kaitou Kid's plan to open the safe. Conan suspects that Kaitou Kid is one of the three newly hired workers of Jirokichi. Jirokichi however continues to proclaim it to be the work of an imposter, causing Conan to suspect Jirokichi as Kid himself.\nThe nearly hired maid and adviser inform Conan of Jirokichi's strange behavior. They reveal that after dinner, two plates are always missing and Jirokichi always brings his cane with him to the safe. Jirokichi asks the maid for a hand and they head to his room. Jirokichi leaves with his bodyguard for a drive. Shortly after, an unconscious Jirokichi is found tied up and his room and a note of Kaitou Kid is found on the safe. This causes the whole police force that are guarding the safe to abandon their position and chase after \"Jirokichi\".\n",
