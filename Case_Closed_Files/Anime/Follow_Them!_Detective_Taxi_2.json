    "Situation": "Every ten years, a so-called \"Jewelry Washing Festival\" is held at Tsubaki Shrine. Jewels that are washed by the water in the shrine's well will supposedly shine brighter and their value will increase. With such great outcomes, only wealthy people, jewelry store owners, and luxury car owners come to the festival as participants. One participant, named Yoko Matsuda, comes to the shrine for this festival, and her driver is none other than \"Detective Taxi\" Genki Ishikawa. As Ishikawa looks at the various luxury cars of other participants, he notices a suspicious-looking duo taking pictures of those cars, and decides that a case is abound.\n\nAfter dropping off Matsuda at the festival, Ishikawa heads straight to Mouri's Detective Agency to inform him of the situation. He invites Kogoro to investigate with him, but Kogoro turns down Ishikawa's request, citing that Ran's request of making sandwiches for Conan is more important. Ishikawa decides to investigate the situation by himself, but before he leaves, Kogoro gives him half of a sandwich that Kogoro messed up. Ishikawa eats Kogoro's sandwich on the way back to the shrine. As soon as Ishikawa comes back to Tsubaki Shrine to investigate the suspicious duo, he hears a scream and rushes into the shrine grounds, leading him to find Matsuda having passed out on the ground. When Matsuda wakes up, however, she screams again, and Ishikawa is then knocked out by an unknown person from behind.\nBack at the detective agency, Kogoro and Conan are eating their sandwiches (with Conan noting that Kogoro has used too much ketchup) when they hear a TV news report of a robbery that had taken place at Tsubaki Shrine. This prompts Kogoro and Conan to rush to the shrine and investigate what happened. Upon entering the shrine though, they find the police leaving. After Kogoro asks the shrine maid of what had happened, the shrine maid confirms that it was only an attempted robbery.\n\nBut no one has seen a taxi driver named Genki Ishikawa, even though his taxi is still parked by the shrine. Approaching the taxi, Conan hears a noise from the trunk, and Kogoro opens it to find Ishikawa tied up inside.\n\n",
    "People": "- Victim (attempted robbery)\n- 40 years old\n- Shrine visitor\n- Mysterious person\n- Mysterious person\n- Shrine maiden\n- Head priest\n- \"TV News\" newscaster\n- \"TV News\" reporter\n",
    "Resolution": "Kogoro and Ishikawa initially came to the conclusion that the robber wasn't came after the jewels, but the washing fee, as every participants had to pay 100,000 yen in advance. However, the money are safe and accounted for. Conan later came to a conclusion, after hearing that the suspicious duo were taking pictures of participant car's license plates, that Yoko Matsuda was faking the attempted robbery to create a commotion and lead the shrine staffs away from the main building. So the suspicious duo can get in the shrine and take information of the shrine's jewelry record. The reason to take the participant's license plates is because they can be used to identify the name and address of the owners. Which they can cross-examine with the jewelry record to find who has the most jewels and plan out a robbery crime.\nHowever, they didn't expect Ishikawa to came in before the shrine staffs. And because Ishikawa have a red-colored mark on his mouth from eating Kogoro's sandwitch (as Kogoro was putting too much ketchup) Matsuda was terrified by his face and let out the second scream which they didn't plan for. This prompted one of the suspicious duo to attack Ishikawa and trapped him in the taxi truck to keep him away.\nAfter hearing from the shrine maiden that the person who washed the most jewelry, the owner the Ginza branch of New York jewelry store named Wonder Jewelry has left the shrine a while ago. Ishikawa drive his taxi (with Conan on board) to catch up with the owner. However, by the time they catch up with her, she was already robbed by Matsuda and her suspicious duo.\n- Victim (robbed)\n- Owner of the Wonder Jewelry's Ginza branch\n\nConan was able to track down the suspicious duo with the purse via the Telescopic Lenses. So Ishikawa tried to put up a siren for an emergency chase, but Conan warned him not to do that due to it being a violation of the Road Vehicles Act. Ishikawa's taxi did catch up to the suspicious duo with the purse, but they threw it to Matsuda and tried using the road traffic to get away from the taxi. However, Ishikawa and Conan eventually found them, thanks the jewelry they're wearing shine brighter than usual as they were washed by Tsubaki Shine's well water.\nAs Ishikawa and Conan catching up with Matsuda on Kachidoki Bridge. Matsuda and the suspicious duo form together as the duo jump onto Matsuda's scooter. While Matsuda enable the scooter's modified boost mode, putting them further away from the taxi. So Conan take out his Turbo Engine Skateboard to catching up with them, and kicked Ishikawa's siren with the Power-Enhancing Kick Shoes to knock the purse out of their hand. Conan was able to grab the purse and save them, while Matsuda and the suspicious duo fall down out of their scooter and were arrested by the police.\n",
