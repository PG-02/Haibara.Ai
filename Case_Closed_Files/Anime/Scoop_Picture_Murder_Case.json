    "Situation": "In Angel City Hotel, the photographer named Ryuuichi Yanase wins the 35th Yomikiri Photography Award in the award ceremony and he also receives a brand new watch. He was nominated by the crime news department. Yanase's award winning photographs of various incidents are also shown as a slideshow.\nAfter the award ceremony, Kogoro gives his business card to Yanase and Yanase is glad to meet the famous detective in person. In return Yanase also gives his business card to Kogoro. He says he captured those wonderful pictures by pure luck and coincidence. Until suddenly, a man named Atsushi Nakai introduces and gives his business card to Kogoro revealing him to be a newspaper reporter.\nIt is obvious that Yanase and Nakai do not get along, as Yanase does not like Nakai at all whenever he's near him. Nakai then takes out some unknown white powder from his pocket and blows it at Yanase’s face. Yanase startled tells  Nakai to leave him alone and hastily leaves. Conan checks the white powder and sees that it is (Calcium Oxide: CaO) burnt lime.\nAt the Mouri Detective Agency, the phone rings and Conan answers it. It's Nakai and he wants to talk to Kogoro Mouri because he believes that his life is in danger. Conan tries to wake Kogoro up while he's sleeping but he can’t get him to wake up. Conan having no choice uses the voice changing bowtie to mimic Kogoro's voice while talking to Nakai on the phone.\nWhen Conan gets back on the phone, he asks Nakai why his life is in danger and who is threatening him. Nakai claims that someone is after his life and wants Kogoro to investigate and protect him. Suddenly, the culprit hits Nakai with an ashtray and hangs up the phone. Conan takes Nakai's business card from Kogoro's inside coat pocket and takes a ride on a taxi. Meanwhile in Nakai's apartment, the culprit turns the water on in the kitchen sink and leaves.\nConan arrives at the apartment just in time to witness Nakai crashing through his window and falling to his death while engulfed in flames.\n\nWhile he's falling, Conan sees Yanase taking pictures of the incident from the highway. The next day, all the newspapers have pictures of Nakai when he's on fire falling to his death taken by Yanase. He tells the news reporters that it was just coincidence and pure luck that he happened to be at the right place at the right time.\nRan is reading the newest article about Yanase and she thinks he certainly has exceptional luck as a crime scene photographer. But whatever he claims, it's too much of a coincidence. Then Kogoro returns, he reveals that Nakai died from blunt force trauma to the head, but the coroner came to the conclusion that he accidentally killed himself because he was drunk.\nHe accidentally set his apartment on fire, lost his balance, fell, and hit his head on the pavement. The police believe and most likely will rule his death as an unfortunate accident. Conan asks about the cause of fire and Kogoro doesn't know the details but it apparently started in the kitchen sink.\nConan went back to Nakai's apartment and investigates. Last night, the phone call for Kogoro came at 10:30 pm. By the time he rushed to the apartment by taxi ride, it was 10:50. Judging by the progress of the fire, Conan can safely conclude that the fire started as soon as the phone went dead. Yanase was taking pictures from the bridge of the apartment.\nWithout a car, it would be impossible to get up there. Suddenly, Conan notices the entrance for the highway bus. Conan goes to the road bridge and sees through the window which is directly across from Nakai's apartment. It is the perfect spot to take pictures. Yanase couldn't have gotten to the road bridge purely by luck. What's more, it takes no more than three minutes to get to the highway from the crime scene. Conan finds traces of white powder on his sleeve and it is revealed to be Calcium oxide (CaO) (quicklime or burnt lime). The lime could be the connected to the fire that started in the kitchen sink.\nLater, Conan buys a magazine article about the incident and Nakai's death. At the playground, he looks at the picture of Nakai crashing through the window. He notices something and went to Professor Agasa's house for his help. Conan wants Agasa to analyze the picture and he points to the mirror in the background of Nakai crashing through the window. Agasa puts the magazine article on the scanner and imports the picture of Nakai crashing through the window onto his computer screen.\nHe zooms in to the kitchen reflected in the mirror. When he zooms in to the kitchen sink, it's so pixelated and it's not clear enough. Agasa fixes it and he finally made the picture more sharp and clear. There's a broken watch on the kitchen counter and Conan has no doubt that it was murder and now he knows who did it. Agasa mentions that Yanase will be on tv tomorrow and he was advertising  it in a commercial. Yanase is going to invite Kogoro as his first guest to his show. Conan realized this a good chance and comes up with an idea to expose Yanase as the murderer.\nThe next day at Nichiuri TV, Yanase thanks Kogoro for coming to his show as his first guest. When they shake hands, a pink paper slip falls out of Yanase's pocket. The pink paper is actually a police notification and it's because last time when he saw the smoke, he subconsciously increased speed and got caught by the surveillance camera. Conan went to the phone and called Inspector Megure. Kogoro is getting ready for the show and Conan tells him that there's dirt on his collar and that he's going to brush it off when he actually puts the button speaker on him.\n",

    "Resolution": "First, at the time of the incident, he was taking photos from the highway, Yanase asks how did he set the fire at Nakai's apartment. Conan deduces that it only take three minutes to get from where he was taking pictures to the crime scene, if he used the staircase for highway bus passengers. He took advantage of that, went to Nakai's room and attacked him, knocking him unconscious. He set up some kind of a time device, returned to the highway, and waited for the fire to start so he could begin taking pictures.\nThe time device wasn't found at the crime scene and it was burned to ashes. The cause of the fire is lime which is a caustic lime, this is what Yanase used as a time device. Caustic lime is different from the slaked lime used to draw lines on athletic fields in the sense that when water is added, the exothermic reaction can reach up to 300 degrees. Then he conveniently used hot sake as a fuel, When bags of lime at a construction sites were dampened by rain water, it reacted and sometimes even caused a fire. He filled the sink with caustic lime and newspaper then he added water, allowing it to react.\nConan deduced that with the added newspaper, it cause start the fire to ignite even quicker. He also believed that the pictures Yanase won the award for was also taken in a similar fashion. Nakai found out about it and threatened Yanase by blowing caustic lime in his face revealing he knew about his treachery. The very pictures he took provided the conclusive evidence of his guilt. Suddenly, Agasa appeared and showed the enhanced picture of the kitchen sink on his computer.\nFirst, the kitchen sink, Water came out of the faucet by lowering the lever. The lever had been lowered 1/4th of the way, in other words, at the time of the fire, water was running from the faucet as the timed device. Also, on Yanase's wrist, the watch which he received from the award ceremony was no where to be found on his person and there was his watch on Nakai's kitchen counter in the picture on Agasa's computer. Yanase took it off so it wouldn't get wet while he adjusted the water flow, and then he forgot to take it with him.\nIt had been scorched because it was so close to the fire, however Yanase counters this buoy saying that Nakai stole his watch from him. Suddenly, Inspector Megure appears by making a V sign which means victory, a gesture popularized by Winston Churchill. He was asked by Kogoro (actually Conan when he called him on the phone awhile ago) for the floppy disk which contained video data of a highway, taken by the surveillance camera used to catch speeders. The time was 10:20 pm on the night of the fire. In other words, it was just ten minutes before Kogoro received a phone call from Nakai.\nAgasa then shows the image of Yanase driving a car. When Agasa zooms in, Yanase was wearing the watch at that moment, He was wearing it right before the time of the crime. The fact that the watch which was in Nakai's apartment is the very proof that he was at the scene of the crime. The photographer seeking to capture definite moments was captured at the definitive moment himself. Conan as Kogoro states that it seems Yanase had forgotten the most important part of being a photographer. The word \"photograph\" is composed of the characters, \"reflect\" and \"truth\". Yanase shocked and appalled by his actions surrenders and is arrested for murder.\n",
