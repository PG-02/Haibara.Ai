The match starts, but after losing the courage, Yamazaki's friends and shop owners Hajime Fujinami and Ichiro Tenryuu jump to the match to help him, but fail even after using \"dangerous weapons\" like a bottle opener or fresh honwasabi, that finally hurt Kogoro. Conan finally decides to sleep Kogoro and starts his deduction. Conan finally confronts Madam Gaga and says that the GGP has lost this match. It turns out that 'the GGP (Madam Gaga, Cutie Mimi and Rabbit Suzuki) use their events as a \"scapegoat\" to steal jewelry from different jewelries around the country. By using elemenets as a generator, a manhole and a cord, they are able to rob jewelry stores that have storehouses in an underground passageway. It is also revealed that in the meantime the event was held, Rabbit Suzuki was entering to the subterrain storehouse, but only to find police officers that arrest him. They are arrested for property damage and attempted robbery, but probably this isn't the first rob they do.\n\n\n",
