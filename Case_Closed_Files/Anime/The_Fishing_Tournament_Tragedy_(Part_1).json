    "Situation": "Ran and Conan were invited to a fishing tournament in Lake Okutani, Kanagawa Prefecture, that was being sponsored by Sonoko's father's company. After hearing that, Genta, Ayumi and Mitsuhiko wanted to come along as well. During the tournament, they met Ayukawa Saori and Masubuchi Takuya, both participants, and Funaki Toshihiko, a freelance writer. On the second day of the tournament, Funaki was found dead by Ran and Sonoko near the lake.\n\nConan suspected that Ayukawa or Masubuchi is behind the said murder.\nConan and the Detective Boys continued their investigation. They later found out that Funaki-san was murdered in a different place. Meanwhile, Masubuchi-san was being suspected by Inspector Jugo Yokomizo for the lack of alibi.\n",

    "Resolution": "Saori Ayukawa turned out to be the one who murdered Funaki. She killed him because she was being blackmailed by Funaki-san for witnessing her accidentally pushing Kanie-san that led to his death.\nOn the other hand, Conan was convinced that Ayukawa-san was the one who committed the well-thought out murder of Funaki-san. After acquiring evidence that will prove Ayukawa-san's crime, Conan shot Sonoko with his tranquilizer watch and presented his deduction through her.\nShe had positioned a wooden plank on the bridge above the train tracks and had a rock, and her handkerchief tied to it as well. While Funaki-San was busy taking pictures of the train, she used her skills as a pro fisherman and hurled her lure onto the handkerchief. Then she yanked with all her might and caused the plank and rock to fall hitting him on the head, at the same time he fell on top of the train and was carried all the way to where he was found.\nThe evidence of her guilt is the photos of the train that Funaki-San was taking and the stain that was found on his vest. Which turned out to be from the train when he rode on top of it, and finally the wooden plank with her handkerchief tied to it. Earlier she had used it to clean Ayumi's knees after she scrapped them while playing near the rocks, proving that the handkerchief belonged to her and no one else as Ayumi's blood is still on it.\nHer motive was that she had been talking to a fellow fisherman Kensuke Kanie, he had feelings for her but was too forward. When he tried to hug her, she pushed him away, which accidentally caused him to landed on top of a passing train that carried him off to his death. Funaki-San had witnessed this and rather then tell the police, he saw this as a opportunity to blackmail her every now and again.\nHe did so every chance he got, eventually the amount of money he had continually asked for kept increasing. As a result Saori Ayukawa decided to kill him the same way she killed Kanie in the past.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Ayukawa is a freshwater trout river's name.\n- There is a poster with the garden from The Mystery of the Water-Flowing Stone Garden.\n- The list of fishing participants:\n",
