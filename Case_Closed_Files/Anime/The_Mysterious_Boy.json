    "Situation": "On the Kometo Bridge, Tokujiro Nagai told Tsutomu Oshiro that he had something to discuss with him, after making him drunk by giving him a Scotch. While Oshiro's back was temporarily turned, Nagai hurled a flashing boomerang and then quickly drew Oshiro's attention to it. When Oshiro looked after the mysterious glowing object flying by, Nagai grabbed his legs and tipped him over the bridge railing to his death in the dried-out riverbed.\n\nOn a sunny afternoon, the Detective Boys were remarking about the \"UFO incident\" that happened rather recently around the area. Mitsuhiko said that there have been three sightings since the month started. And allegedly, it was something glowing gold in the sky, with some witnesses of aliens on the riverbed. Later, they noticed a shop situated nearby named \"Nagai's Toys\", and the curtains of it seemed to be opened. However, as Genta tried to open it, the door was locked.\nEveryone here knows this store. Ayumi said that the store was run by a nice old couple. Genta added that the toys they sell are too old and never the ones he wants. The majority decided to leave. At this time, Genta's strawberry-flavored ice cream imperceptibly stained Conan's clothes. Their every move was monitored specifically by the debt collector, Tsutomu, who was behind the window of the store. He was negotiating with the store owner, Tokujiro, concerning the money that Tokujiro had borrowed from him. Tsutomu discovered that the kid with glasses kept staring at a toy engine that was deposited on top of the shelf. As he was touching the toy engine, it fell from the shelf to the ground. And apparently, the little mechanical pieces of the toy were scattering all around the floor. And Tokujiro got quite angry with him because he claimed that his wife treasured this engine.\nTsutomu's aggressiveness made Tokujiro give him a bottle of scotch, and Tsutomu drank it straight away. After that, Tokujiro led him to the Kometo Bridge, and the scenario described before happened.\nMeanwhile, the Detective Boys were still searching for the curious UFO under the bridge. Conan found a \"flashing boomerang\" on the ground, and when he pressed it, the light started glowing gold. And not far away from it, the corpse of Tsutomu was lying under the bridge.\nMegure declared that it was an accident, but Conan rebutted his perspective. Since he discovered a coupon for half off at a restaurant called \"Shinobiya Ramen\" that was put inside his wallet. Conan deduced that he must be desperate to eat ramen that day, and it seemed fairly out of left field that he took a complete different route from the ramen restaurant. Hence, most of the clues did not look plausible. In addition, Conan identified something black on top of the victim's hand. What could it be?\nIn \"Nagai's Toys\", Tokujiro was fixing the toy engine that Tsutomu broke. He heard some noise outside, and as he opened the door, Conan asked if he could stay in his store for some time because their parents had not yet arrived home. At the same time, Tokujiro found out that the boy in front of him seemed to be the kid who came to the toy store ten years ago.\n",

    "Resolution": "Tokujiro Nagai murdered Oshiro in order to avenge the death of his wife. Mrs. Nagai was hospitalized due to a serious sickness, but Tokujiro's earnings were too modest to afford her treatments, so he was forced to borrow money from Kuromaru Finance. Oshiro, whenever he came by to check on the investment, callously bullied Nagai, which the old man endured for his wife's sake. But then Oshiro decided to demand repayment from Mrs. Nagai, heedless of her condition. When she heard that her husband had plunged himself into debt, Mrs. Nagai suffered a breakdown which contributed to her death soon afterwards.\nUpon that revelation, Nagai remembers Conan, or rather Shinichi, from an incident ten years ago, when one of a group of children visiting his toy shop had dropped a toy engine to the floor, breaking it. Shinichi found out which child had done it, but Nagai kindly refused to run after the offender for this accident, because he believe the child would come back by himself, which he did.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This episode marks the only time that a single-case, anime-original character discovers Conan's identity.\n- Screenwirter for this episode, Takahiro Okura, under the recommendation of Gosho Aoyama, first time participates the Detective Conan anime production.\n",
    "Quotes": "- Tokujiro Nagai (to Conan Edogawa):\nNo, that's not possible. You haven't changed at all since ten years ago. What on earth...?  (ん?あっ…いや、そんなはずはない…君は10年前と全然変わっていない…いったい…)\n- Conversation between Juzo Megure and Tokujiro Nagai on the bridge:\nJuzo Megure: Maybe I shouldn't ask, but why did you turn yourself in?  (目暮十三「しかし、私が言うのもなんですが、なぜ自首を？」)\nTokujiro Nagai: A mysterious boy appeared.  (長井徳次郎「不思議な少年が現れたんですよ…」)\nJuzo Megure: A mysterious boy?  (目暮十三「不思議な少年？」)\nTokujiro Nagai: Yes, a mysterious boy who hadn't changed at all since ten years ago. He... He may have been sent by my wife in heaven.  (長井徳次郎「ええ… 10年前とまったく姿、形が変わらない少年…彼は…彼は天国にいる妻が遣わした者だったのかもしれませんな…」)\n"
