    "Situation": "The Detective Boys while walking around town hear a woman in an apartment scream. They investigate the source of the screaming and find a dead old woman stuffed inside of a sofa.\n\nThe police arrive and interrogate Sanae Hosono, the woman who found the body, and learn that she recently bought the sofa from a flower shop. While the police question the inhabitants of the apartment, the Detective Boys along with Takagi, interrogate the employees of the flower shop who bought in the sofa. They learn that the sofa was found on the curbside of the apartment.\n",
    "People": "- 28 years old\n- Apartment resident\n- Victim (bludgeoned)\n- Moneylender\n- 39 years old\n- Apartment resident\n- Alcohol shop owner\n- 40 years old\n- Recycle shop owner\n- 50 years old\n- Recycle shop deliveryman\n- Recycle shop deliveryman\n",
    "Resolution": "- Conclusion\nMitsuhiko concludes that the culprit is Kazuhiro Tokunaga due to his suspicious testimony about hearing people fighting in Sanae's room, despite the fact that Sanae herself had gone to the theatre during the time of murder which was confirmed by the theatre staffs and visitors, which means that he lied in order to shift the suspicion to her. The reason he hid the victim's body inside the sofa at the trash collecting area was because he feared that the cat burglar, who is known to roam in the area, may have broken into his room and found the body. Additionally, because of his hardworking personality, he has never missed going to work, thus fearing that he may arouse suspicion should he took a day off to dispose the body.\nAlthough there is no concrete prove, the police are likely to find evidence remaining from the murder in his room, along with his relation to the victim once her identity is identified.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Toshimichi Hirose's truck is a 1993 Mitsubishi Fuso Canter.\n- One of the paintings in the recycle shop reappears in Kaitou Kid and the Four Masterpieces and Metropolitan Police Detective Love Story 8: The Left Hand's Ring Finger. Open spoiler box to see images.\n"
