    "Situation": "While riding the Yurikamome Line towards Wangan Island, Kogoro and Conan witness a man sitting next to them getting shot through the arm from the window. After stopping the bleeding with a scarf borrowed from another passenger, they order the train to stop and explain the situation to a station employee through a phone call. After staff arrived, Kogoro and Conan run towards the place where the culprit could have shot from and ask the staff to call the police. By looking around the surroundings, Conan figures out the shooter must have been posted in a particular apartment building and he convinces Kogoro to go with him there. At the MPD, Megure sends Takagi to the crime location.\n\nFrom the height of the wound of the victim, Conan deduces the shot must have been made from room 505, but upon investigating the unlocked and empty apartment, they conclude there is not enough evidence to prove the culprit was there. Meanwhile, there are spied upon by a mysterious black figure. Before leaving, Conan uses Kogoro's voice to call Takagi and have him search the apartment more thoroughly with a forensics team. Outside the building, the duo notice a path of blood stains, but Kogoro doesn't find any relation between the attempted murder and the path. He receives a call from Takagi who says that the victim, Daisuke Maruta is in a safe condition and that he didn't seem to have any reason to justify the shot made against him. The police detective also adds that after investigating the apartment, he found from a positive luminol reaction traces of blood in the room and that the bullet found was one from a small handgun, meaning that sniping someone using it would have been excruciatingly difficult, given the distance. Through a hint from Conan, Takagi, and Kogoro figure out that Maruta must have been shot by accident. The culprit first shot someone else at a close range inside the apartment, and the bullet pierced the body and reached Maruta by accident. This would explain the blood in the apartment.\n\nKogoro then understands that the blood path must have been from the culprit carrying the corpse away, since nobody was found inside the apartment. While following the path, they notice a peculiar smell, which leads them towards a car. Inside it was a bound woman. While looking around the car, they see traces of an oil leak and an empty gas tank on the asphalt, and Conan figures out that the culprit wants to make the car explode. From a side building, the mysterious man ignites the trail of gas, and Conan and Kogoro barely manage to free the woman from the car before it explodes.\n\nLater on, Takagi and the police team catches up with them and get the woman's statement. She is Kiyomi Tamura and was kidnapped a while ago while walking on the pavement. Since there seemed to be no reason for her to be kidnapped, the duo conclude that she was used as a bait to lure Conan and Kogoro towards her and buy the culprit some time, the same one who shot Maruta. From their reflections, it seemed that someone carrying a large object would be easily noticeable, and that the only safe place for them to carry the body around would the the Toto Market, where people come and go with substantial merchandise.\n\nUnfortunately, at the market, it seems that the culprit struck again, after a man found out about the bag they were carrying and was knocked out by them.\nThe group consisting of Kogoro, Conan and Takagi later arrive at the fish market. A police officer already stationed there informs them of something having happened in the parking lot. There, they find a wholesaler who has been assaulted probably by the same man they are pursuing, since he says that he was attacked from behind after noticing a large bag, most likely containing the body. Since his clothes and his turret truck were stolen, the group deduces that the culprit used them to blend in with the wholesalers. Detective Chiba then calls them from MPD and informs them that he has gathered information regarding the resident of apartment 505. The resident is Ichiro Akiyama, a leasing company worker who recently went unemployed, and a suspect in a robbery from four months ago.\n\nFrom the information obtained, it is most likely that, even though he was cleared since he had an alibi, Akiyama was still involved in the robbery. The gun used was a Tokarev, the same one that was used in Maruta's attempted murder, and Akiyama had recently started a lavish lifestyle, most likely after earning a large amount of money. Since Akiyama was just a company worker, he would have most likely been collaborating with a bank employee to be able to get the information about the convoy's schedules, and Takagi thus asks Chiba to check up on the bank employees that were absent on the day of the robbery. Officers then arrive in the parking lot and inform the group that they have found the turret truck, which presented traces of blood on it. Since the truck was abandoned, the body was most likely disposed in an abandoned place, and Takagi and Conan figure out the only place in the market that would have less people would be the underground warehouse. At the location, they see that the lock had been broken, and decide to go inside to investigate. At the same time, the culprit is standing next to Akiyama's body in the warehouse, and is preparing to open his body with a knife, but is stopped when he hears sounds coming from Takagi and the others. While searching, Takagi looks up the list of absent employees, but is interrupted by Kogoro, who notices sources of light coming from the other direction.\n\nWhile nearing in on the light source, they hear sounds of a struggle and end up finding Takuro Samejima, one of the absent bank employees on the list, injured on the ground, along with Akiyama's body next to it. Samejima says he was attacked by an unknown person, and is then brought out of the warehouse by paramedics. While still searching for the culprit, Conan figures out the truth.\n",

    "Resolution": "- Samejima has no reason to be in the warehouse in the first place.\n- No one else was found in the warehouse, besides the police, Kogoro, Conan, Samejima and Akiyama's body.\n- The clothes he is wearing are most likely the ones from the wholesaler he robbed earlier, an examination of the clothes will prove it.\n- Samejima took a leave four months ago on the day of the robbery.\n- Akiyama's body has a knife next to it, and Samejima was most likely trying to open it to find the key he swallowed. Closer inspection of the body will be able to detect the key.\n- Samejima lied to his coworkers about going to Taiwan when he took a leave two days ago, most likely to commit the string of crimes that led to his arrest.\n- He is carrying a gun similar to the one used in the past robbery and in Maruta's attempted murder.\n- Gunshot residue and blood was found in Akiyama's apartment, as well as on the sidewalks near the apartment.\n\n\nWhile still trying to prove his innocence, Samejima blurts out Akiyama's name by accident, which he shouldn't have known, had he not been the culprit. It turns out the police were trying to force him into making a mistake by saying the victim's name.\n- (Prior to timeline) Akiyama and Samejima rob the Beika Bank convoy and get away with the money.\n- (Prior to timeline) Akiyama keeps the money to himself and starts spending it impulsively. He also hides the rest of the money from Samejima by keeping it inside a coin locker.\n- (Prior to timeline) Samejima takes a two-day leave pretending to go to Taiwan, but uses the time to go look for Akiyama.\n- Samejima arrives at Akiyama's apartment and gets in an argument with the latter. Akiyama swallows the key and gets shot by Samejima.\n- The bullet hits Maruta as collateral damage.\n- After hearing about the injury of an unrelated person, Samejima runs away with the body and plans to open it at the fish market.\n- Seeing that Kogoro and Conan are following him, he kidnaps Tamura and tries to kill her in an explosion to divert the two away from him.\n- After arriving at the market, Samejima assaults the wholesaler and takes his clothes.\n- Samejima then accesses the underground warehouse and prepares to open Akiyama's body.\n- Samejima is almost seen by the police and injures himself to avoid suspicion.\nAfter being found out, Samejima decides to shoot Kogoro, but is stopped by Conan's soccer ball and kick shoes. He is then arrested and taken away.\nAfter Samejima is arrested, the police is able to extract the key from Akiyama's stomach and they end up finding the stolen amount in a coin locker in Toto Station. Kogoro and Conan decide to eat ramen at the fish market after the case is solved, with Conan complaining that they should have eaten sushi, since it was a fish market after all.\n",
