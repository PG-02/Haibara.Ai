    "Situation": "While on the way to a Yoko Okino concert Kogoro loses his ticket. Luck seems to be on his side when a young lady named Masayo Aoshima has an extra ticket, but the concert ends up being the last thing on their minds when they walk into her sister Mina's house and comes upon an apparent suicide.\n\nConan has his own suspicions though, since he has caught Masayo laughing hard, but can he find enough evidence to prove contrary when the victim is found in a sealed room?\nJust as it appears the perfect crime has been committed, Detective Takagi returns with news that could show Mina cared more for her sister than anyone realized. When a spot of Mina's blood is also found on the door, it is all the clues Conan needs to prove Masayo murdered her sister.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (wrist slit)\n- 24 years old\n- Masayo's younger sister\n- Haido Department Store employee\n- 26 years old\n- Mina's older sister\n- Beika Bank employee\n- Mina and Masayo's friend\n- 25 years old\n- Stage name: Ryo\n- Real-life actress\n- Waitress\n- Cashier\n",
    "Resolution": "At first, Masayo's plan was to lock Mina in a makeshift poisoned/locked room with a poured bathroom cleaner as the improvised 'weapon', expecting Mina to die of asphixiation. The cleaner was too soft, however; therefore Masayo knocked her victim out, filled the tub with water and slit Mina's wrist, placing her injured arm inside the water so she'd bleed out faster. Then she left Mina's corpse and got ready to leave to the Yoko concert, using Kogoro as her alibi.\nThe clue that let Conan identify Masayo as Mina's killer was the reddish Yoko headband that she was wearing. One of the letters forming Yoko's name was smeared in something red, Mina's blood, which was not only on the water but on the door. At some point Masayo looked through the keyhole right after killing Mina, and that's when her headband got bloodstained.\n",
