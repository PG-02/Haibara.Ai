    "Situation": "Takagi loses his notebook after breaking up a fight between a manager and his singer. He searches for his book with the help of Conan, Haibara, and the Detective Boys.\n\n",
    "People": "- 30 years old\n- Ballad singer\n- 52 years old\n- Jiro's manager\n",
    "Resolution": "\n- While helping to look for the notebook, Hanzaki purposely asked Takagi for the time, even though there was a clock right in front of him in the park.\n- Hanzaki kept checking the clock rather than eat at the all-you-could-eat as he energetically claimed he would.\n- Hanzaki bought a block of ice and a slab of concrete, which was used to create a mechanism which would eventually drop the concrete upon the manager Sugiyama's head. This was found in his apartment bathroom, along with Sugiyama.\n- Hanzaki blamed his manager for his lack of fame and success.\nHanzaki was in fact attempting to kill his manager, and was planning on using Takagi to help build his alibi. \nThe murder was to take place in Hanzaki's apartment's bathroom. He set up the mechanism to kill Sugiyama while he was elsewhere, planning to return afterwards to dump the body.\nThe Detective Boys and Takagi arrive just in time to save Sugiyama. As it turns out, the person who has Takagi's notebook is Seiichi Sugiyama. Hanzaki just observed Sugiyama taking it. Hanzaki is promptly arrested after being confronted by his manager and Takagi.\n"
