    "Situation": "After a long day of helping to clean and tidy the birdhouses at the park shed, the Detective Boys inquired of the park warden, Satoshi Kimishima, if he had more work to deploy to them. Fearing that he would not trust their abilities, they introduced themselves. After that, Kimishima finally asked them if they could find the owner of a hat that had stayed in the lost-and-found box for so long that it was time to dispose of it. After the Detective Boys had accepted the offer, the park warden walked towards another man, Hayato Izumiya, who was handing Kimishima a big purse filled with stuff. According to the park warden, there are many visitors that give the birds food, so it must be a bag full of food.\nMitsuhiko, using his perceptive observation skills, along with his astonishing deduction skills, managed to find the hat owner. Evidently, the owner of that hat is named Nozomu Katsumi. He was also surprised when Mitsuhiko handed him the hat and inquired how he knew it was his. Since the symbol on the hat looked custom-made, it was most likely an amateur baseball team. In addition, they contacted the hat manufacturer, following the clues, which helped them find Katsumi's teammates - that was how he found the hat owner. After that, Mitsuhiko disclosed that he actually consulted the \"canon\" of Sherlock Holmes Stories. And this time it was \"The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\".\nWhen the Detective Boys left Katsumi's premise, they found out by questioning some regular park visitors that most of their (or their friend's) jewels were stolen by the new burglar. That was infamously known in the entire district, and a police officer the Detective Boys met informed every resident and strengthened their awareness of it. At the same time, Haibara showed a police officer a sketch book that a female old lady gave her. There were a lot of drawings she drew within this park, and after the police officer had seen it, he pointed at a man drawn on the sketch book, which was apparently the park warden, Kimishima, and said that he had questioned him three times already because he felt him being somewhat suspicious, however, no falws were found on him. This sentence gave Conan a clearer idea of what was going on. And combining the discovery Mitsuhiko found, which all of the people who got robbed were regular park visitors, Conan figured out the culprit's trick of stealing jewels. Conan claimed Kimishima was the burglar, who knew the park visitors' time out. With this information, he could steal the jewels when the visitors were strolling out in the park. Moreover, to avoid any evidence being left on himself, he decided to take advantage of the pigeons he raised. With some practice, it should not be difficult to make them steal the jewels. He knew very well that pigeons have \"homing instincts\", which are their ability to return to their nests. But when the Detective Boys went to see Kimishima, they found Kimishima struggling in the head with tonnes of blood. What happened to him?\n\nThe Detective Boys analysed the situation of this attempted murder: there were leather shoeprints on the floor, which were apparently not the victim's since Kimishima wore sneakers; and the weapon to strike the victim's head was the bat left in the lost-and-found box. In other words, the culprit was someone Kimishina knows, probably an accomplice or a robbery-related person. The mess in the shed might not be the result of their tussling, but Conan deduced that the culprit must have been searching the shed to find someone. Most likely flee away when seeing the arrival of the Detective Boys, they must be hiding somewhere in this park to watch out for another opportunity to sneak in once again. Later on, the Detective Boys began their investigation into \"finding the culprit\". When the sun was about to set, all of the members of Detective Boys had gathered together, except Mitsuhiko, who was still poking around in the park.\nInside the restroom, Mitsuhiko was washing his hands. When he lifted his hands upward, he recalled himself carrying the birdhouse this morning, which made him think of something. He swiftly ran out of the restroom and went to the shed, seemingly understanding the truth of the case. On the other hand, the culprit was watching him at the back of the tree trunk. Thus, what did Mitsuhiko find out? And who is the culprit?\n",

    "Resolution": "",
    "Mitsuhiko's time to shine": "The culprit also got fairly curious, because he also did not find the location of the jewels, so he asked Mitsuhiko how he knew it. Mitsuhiko answered that this morning, when he was lifting the birdhouse, he felt that the box was way too heavy for a birdhouse to be. And according to the crime scene, he did not find any traits that show the culprit found the jewels. Izumiya seconded and said he hated birds. When Mitsuhiko entered the cabin, he confronted Izumiya, who was waiting for him.\nActually, Izumiya visited the victim this afternoon to discuss their deal. Obviously, the purse Izumiya handed to Kimishima was not a purse filled with food but instead a purse filled with money. On that point, Conan could agree on that as well. If you think this way, it had to be a transcation between the two of them. In this case, it was probably to trade for the jewels Kimishima stole using the pigeons. Knowing these, Izumiya visited him during the afternoon, but Kimishima said that he did not want to keep Izumiya as a partner anymore. And he made numerous rude remarks that enraged Izumiya. Along with his anger, Izumiya took one of the bats placed in the lost-and-found box (there were two initially) and struck Kimishima's head.\nAfter justifying the motive, Izumiya urged Mitsuhiko to give him the bag with jewels quickly. Mitsuhiko looked rather scared and timid, and he \"accidentally\" dropped it back into the lost-and-found box. He went to pick it up, but it took him some minutes; this obviously made Izumiya angry. He then saw a pigeon flying inside the shed. As he confessed, he hated birds, so he even requested that Mitsuhiko hand him the jewel even faster to get rid of the shed as soon as possible. After Mitsuhiko successfully found the bag and gave it to him, Izumiya left hurriedly.\n",
    "Mitsuhiko's tears": "After the culprit left, Mitsuhiko kneeled down on the floor, looking rather sorrowful. At the same time, Conan, Haibara, Ayumi, and Genta found their way to the shed and checked Mitsuhiko out. When Mitsuhiko saw them, he cried utterly in a sad tone and explained that he did not know that the culprit had not found the jewels yet, so he went to check alone. Ayumi still praised him for his guts.\nWhen the others inquired about the jewels, Mitsuhiko took the bag out of the lost-and-found box. Did not Mitsuhiko hand it to the culprit? Mitsuhiko revealed that the jewels he gave him were in fact marbles, as he hid them in the lost-and-found box. He was quite worried that the culprit would verify the content in the bag, so he used the pigeon to scare him away. Conan remarked that it was something out of a Holmes story.\nConan also told Mitsuhiko not to be anxious since he had already informed the police about it and Izumiya would probably be arrested soon. And in fact, Izumiya was being held down by several police on the ground, and when he realised the bag he got from Mitsuhiko was just some marbles, he exclaimed that he got tricked by \"that brat\".\n",
