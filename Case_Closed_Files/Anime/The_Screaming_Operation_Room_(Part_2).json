    "Situation": "When Kogoro goes to his alma mater for a \"speech\", Ran, Sonoko, and Conan end up going with him. Sonsaku Tsujiei, a 4th year student at Beika University, wants Kogoro to look at the haunted house and evaluate its accuracy. When Kogoro takes too long during his speech, Conan, Ran, and Sonoko decide to check out the haunted house themselves. Tsujiei and Kiichi Hachiya, a colleague, escort them into the haunted house only to later play tricks to scare them.\n\nMeanwhile, Sonoko has been pressuring Ran to properly confess to Shinichi about her feelings towards him. Before they're about to go in, Tadami told them, \"Be prepared to feast your eyes upon the manner of my death\". Sonoko told Ran that it's going to be all right and she knows it's all fake. Ran told Sonoko she got scared too. Sonoko then said she didn't expected that she would get scared. That's the whole point of haunted houses. When they are in the \"Operating Room\", Anna Tadami, the victim, is playing the patient during the operation and is convulsing on the operating table. When the trick is over, everyone realizes that Tadami hadn't finished her part. When they try to get her to wake up, Conan realizes she has been poisoned by cyanide.\n\nThe police have arrived at the scene. The police conclude it to be suicide after finding a cyanide capsule in her mouth and her past obsession with death. However, Conan points out that marks on the victim's face revealed an unknown assailant forced Tadami to bite into the capsule allowing the police to consider the possibility of murder.\nConan notices that the blood on the bedsheet is in a thin line.\n",
