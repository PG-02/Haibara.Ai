    "Situation": "Kogoro just finished his investigation report when he heard someone almost got hit by a car.\n\nKogoro then discovers that the man, Ritsuo Esaka, does not remember what happened during the past year.\nThey later go to detective agency, where Esaka tells about how suddenly one year has passed, and how he recovered his original memory while forgetting the memory from the past year. He checked his train card history and he used to left from and returned to Koneru. They conclude that he must have lived in Koneru for the past year.\nMeanwhile, there is a news about Akira Kisugi, a con artist who suddenly disappeared six months ago and was found buried in the mountains of Wakabadai three days ago, partially skeletonized.\n\nLater, they go to Koneru, and ask a police there if he knew Esaka, but the police does not recognize him. Kogoro then try to use shock theraphy to make Esaka regain his memory, but it does not work. Esaka later becomes scared to know if he had done something bad, so he runs away. Apparently, they find out that the police they previously meet is a serial burglar faking as police, so they try to ask the real police at Koneru Station police box. The police recognized Esaka, and says that he was found by an old man named Takuzo Kinbara.\nThey later visit Kinbara residence, where they meet Takuzo and his wife, Tae, and three other people who helped Esaka. For the past year, he had been living under the name Taro Koneru, lived in an apartment Mamoru's father owns, and worked at Hida's construction company. Mizutani also frequently cooked meal for Esaka.\nLater, Kogoro asks if there is anyone who has grudge against Esaka, but they say that Esaka never did anything wrong.\nOn the way to celebrate Esaka's recovery, a dog appears. Esaka is so scared that he climb up a nearby pole. They later find out that Esaka remember the dog's name, which means his memories are returning.\nWhile they are celebrating, a thunder appears, and Esaka feels that there was a scene that is related to dog and thunder. After he goes home, he suddenly interested in Akira Kisugi's death.\nTwo days later, Ritsuo Esaka is found dead in his apartment. According to police investigation, he commited suicide.\n\nThe police say that it is a suicide because there is a suicide note written on the laptop, and the apartment was locked, with two keys a re found inside the  room. There were also two phone call made by Esaka, one to Hida Industries construction company, and one to weather information system. It turns out that Esaka was at Wakabadai on June 10, the same day where Akira Kisugi was murdered, and there was also a lightning strike on that day. The police deduce that the murderer is Ritsuo Esaka.\nHowever, Conan finds out that one of the cup is placed differently on the shelf, which means that someone was there with Esaka before his death.\nLater, they go to Wakabadai and ask people if they recognize Esaka. A woman who owns takoyaki shop says that on that day, Esaka was chased by a dog and he climbed a pole. Later, he saw something, before a lightning appeared. The direction he saw is the street where Akira Kisugi's residence and a temple located. Conan deduces that Esaka saw the culprit, and only tried to kill him recently because they don't know where he live, which also means that the culprit lives in Koneru.\nHowever, among the suspect list, no one lives in Koneru. They later asked Takuzo about it, but he haven't heard anything about it. Hida, Mizutani, and Mamoru later decide to help Kogoro searching anything suspicious.\nConan decides to investigate the intersection where Esaka almost got hit by a car. Next to the intersection is bicycle parking lot, where Takuzo works at. After some futher investigation, Conan knows the culprit.\n",

    "Resolution": "The two struggled with each other however Takuzo was distracted after noticing that Esaka had witnessed the two of them. Takuzo immediately recognized Esaka, but he got dragged off by Kisugi into a alleyway. He managed to free himself from Kisugi, but in the process, he pushed Kisugi too hard into a wall. Causing Kisugi to die from receiving a blow to the back of his head. Takuzo later buried his body, thinking that he didn't need to worry about Esaka witnessing him. He was even more relieved when Esaka suddenly disappeared from his neighborhood.\n- Deceased\n- Tae's younger brother\n- Akira Kisugi's victim\nThree days later Kisugi’s body was found, Takuzo saw Esaka walking around the neighborhood, so he attempted to kill Esaka by pushing him on to the street but failed. He was relieved when Esaka did not remember anything from the past year, but when Esaka started regaining his memory, Takuzo became scared again. So last night he visted Esaka, poisoned him, and made it looked like he committed suicide. He also already made a spare key for Esaka's apartment at a nearby hardware store. There is also a single hair on Kisugi's body that does not belong to him, but most likely belongs to Takuzo.\nTakuzo admits that he murdered Esaka, because he afraid of getting arrested for Kisugi's murder but not because he would spend time in jail, but because his frail wife would be alone.\n",
