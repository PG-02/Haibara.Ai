    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan go on a hiking trip. While walking, Kogoro noticed a vending machine and decided to buy a bottle of \"Guts-man\" as he was suffering from a lack of sleep. He found an extra bottle in the machine and decided to take it. After careful examination of the bottle, he decided to drink it. While he was drinking the extra bottle a passing woman screams.\n\n",
    "People": "- Victim (poison)\n- 26 years old\n- Birth date: May 27, 1971\n- Graduate student\n- Family restaurant worker\n- Tatsuya's stalking victim\n- Tokyo MPD police officer\n- Woman walking her dog\n- Witness\n- Woman's dog\n- Witness\n- Man walking his dog\n- Man's dog\n- Tatsuya's father\n- Ironworks manager\n- Tatsuya's mother\n",
    "Resolution": "\nMiho says that she was too afraid knowing Tatsuya had planned to kill her eventually and the police would not help her so she decided to take matters into her own hands. Sympathetic as Miho is, a self-defense plea will not count in her case: self-defense can only be invoked if there's no premeditation, and since Miho made a whole plan to kill Nagai, it doesn't apply. However, there is evidence in Miho's favor: a bag containing an assortment of harmful tools was found by Conan in the bushes outside her home, with Tatsuya's fingerprints. This means, he had been planning on not only killing her but also torturing her in ways too gruesome to imagine. Due to this evidence, Miho will likely receive a light sentence: self-defense may not be technically appliable, but she was in a desperate enough situation to warrant killing Tatsuya to save herself.\n",

    "Anime": "- The names of the characters and places in the Funimation Dub are:\n- Tatsuya Nagai - Cary Mantle\n- Miho Nishitani - Quinly Peartree\n- Guts-man - Shugi Soda\n- Midori Dai, 3rd District - 1774 Perrybolt LN, Polbe District 55478\n- Haido- chou Family Restaurant - Greasy Meat Diner\n",
    "Trivia": "- This episode features the first use of the show's fifth post-credits stinger image, featuring Ran and Conan rushing toward the foreground, with a grim-looking Shinichi in the background.\n- This episode was likely inspired by the real life Vending Machine Killer, an unidentified serial killer or killers in Japan who tampered with drinks from vending machines. Around the time of the initial murders, the culprit was targeting vending machines that had no CCTV cameras and tampered with a specific type of energy drink, and the poison used was a pesticide that is lethal in humans and currently has no know treatment or antidote for, and the anime similarly identifies the poison as being a phosphoric acid compound typically used in pesticides. The company in the episode is similarly running a contest, which Conan realizes is a clue to identifying the culprit, and the energy drink targeted in real life was running a \"Buy 1 get 1 free\" promotion at the time, and since many people were only wanting 1 drink, they would leave the extra bottles in the pickup slot at the vending machine or next to the machine. Given that this was the early to mid 80's, and that compared to western countries like the United States or Canada, Japan has a low crime rate and typically people there wouldn't be as suspicious of a free full bottle by a vending machine, this likely is why there were so many victims. Kogoro even finds an extra bottle in the pickup slot but is cautioned against drinking it by Ran and Conan.\n"
