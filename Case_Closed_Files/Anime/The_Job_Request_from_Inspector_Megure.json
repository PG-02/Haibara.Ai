    "Situation": "Megure comes to the detective agency to implore Kogoro to help him. Kogoro accepts, and Megure explains the situation: a young man called Ryuji is suspected of having killed his uncle, a famous literature scholar. A witness claims to have seen him exit his uncle's house at the time of the crime. However, the culprit confessed to having burglarized a woman the same day, at the same time he is suspected to have killed his uncle. How could he have been in two places at once?\n\n\n\n",
    "People": "- Victim (burglary)\n- 73 years old\n- Retiree\n- 35 years old\n- Witness\n- 33 years old\n- Reigan's nephew\n- Deceased (stabbed)\n- 70 years old\n- Literature scholar\n",
    "Resolution": "\nHe then called the fire department and also made a false report of a fire in Sasago-cho. As he heard the fire trucks coming, he woke Hide up and turned on the TV in the car and asked her for the money's location before knocking her out again. He then moved her back to Sasago-cho and placed her in her original position and made it seem as if he was there the whole time all in order to make her believe she heard the siren and the TV in her home although she was in a car parked in front of Reigan's house. It would then confirm Maihama's alibi. The evidence is inside Hide's nose and ears. She smelled the fire but didn't hear the bathtub's notice programmed to be at 8am thorough investigation of Maihama's car will confirm everything. Megure then calls his subordinates to inform them of the facts and evidence. It was all clear now Ryuji Maihama was the culprit.\n",
