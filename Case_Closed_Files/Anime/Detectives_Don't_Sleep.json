She tells him that this has happened three times and that they leave gifts each time they sneak in. Kogoro visits her apartment, with Conan tagging along, and she finds that someone has placed a suitcase in her room. Kogoro opens it to see the dead body of Ryuko Kusakabe, Kae's boss, and all of them are shocked.\n\nThe police are called, and they realize that the victim died at 1 am when she was struck on her head with a blunt object. Kae informs them that the culprit snuck into her apartment on Thursdays. The forensic officer then finds a listening device in her room. While questioning the residents of the building, and old lady called Kino Kinoshita tells the police that a resident called Hisashi Tsukumo had once returned Kae's key after she lost it. While asking Tsukumo, the police find that he has his Thursdays off. But Tsukumo informs them that he has an alibi for the previous night.\nMegure then receive a call informing him that the crime occurred at a park in Hidora. The weapon and a lighter with Tsukumo's fingerprints are found near the crime scene. Tsukumo once told Kinoshita that seeing Kae reminded him of his sister. She tells this to Kogoro and Conan.\n",
