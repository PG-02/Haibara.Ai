    "Situation": "When Katsuhiko Nakamoto, a seedy real estate agent, is murdered in his condominium, the police suspect Yoko Sawaki, a well-known dentist in town. They believe that she was getting back at Nakamoto for a crime that he committed twenty-six years ago in a village of East Kofu, Yamanashi Prefecture. Will Conan's investigation vindicate the beautiful dentist or debunk her perfect alibi?\n\n",
    "People": "- 33 years old\n- Sawaki Dental Clinic owner\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- 57 years old\n- Real estate property boss\n- Haido security guard\n",
    "Resolution": "To further keep Ayumi occupied as a witness, she woke her up in time to see Kamen Yaiba live.  However, she promptly gave the sleepy child some sleeping pills instead of pain killers. After Ayumi fell asleep again, she picked her up, and drove her back to her office, and laid her down again.\nShe woke Ayumi up in time to see the preview for next week's episode of Kamen Yaiba. There was no altering of time, since even Ayumi's family can vouch that she was back at 8:05 PM, and they left right after the previews. She let her watch the episode live at her house, but the preview at her office.\nThe evidence that gave her trick away was the deck of the Kamen Yaiba cards in her apartment room. Before she got her tooth pulled, Ayumi took an Ace of Hearts from the deck for good luck. After her tooth was pulled, she put the card back in the deck. She took the card from the deck at the clinic, and 'returned' it into the deck at Yoko's apartment. There should be an extra Ace of Hearts in that deck with Ayumi's fingerprints, proving that she was there.\n\n- Deceased (kidnapped and murdered)\n- 9 years old (26 years ago)\n- Yoko's older brother\n",
