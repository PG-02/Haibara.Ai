    "Situation": "Satoru Tamai takes Emi Maeda to his mansion to have a 4-person class reunion with Kazuma Sasaki and Yosuke Okawa, and Tamai reveals that he and Maeda are engaged, much to the surprise of the other two and partly to Sasaki's jealousy.\nA month later, Tamai goes to Mouri Detective Agency to hire Kogoro to investigate the unusual events that have been happening around him and asks him to be his bodyguard. However, the next day when Kogoro and Conan arrive at Tamai's mansion, they find him drowned in the pool.\nThe police arrive and begin interviewing the suspects based on the class reunion Maeda mentions when she is questioned later. First, Maeda had been practicing for her Mermaid live broadcast that morning when the victim died, and then had lunch; next is Okawa, he was having surgery on a patient at the time; and finally Sasaki, he was in court. All three of them recalled their shared memories from their school days.\nAt the scene, Conan suddenly notices grass in the drain hole of the pool, which is quite strange in general, so he begins to investigate its mysterious origin. From there, Kogoro and Takagi follow him while Megure is still confused about what is happening, in addition, they also find strange traces on the bridge where it seems to be the place where the victim was pushed down. Meanwhile, Okawa and Sasaki are hiding in the bushes, looking surprised to see the three people investigating the bridge while recalling the real events that happened in the past.\nAnd after everyone watches the livestream video, Conan understands the truth of the matter and tranquilizes Kogoro.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (?)\n- 40 years old\n- \"Sunset\" host club manager\n- 40 years old\n- Shopping program host\n- 40 years old\n- Lawyer\n- 40 years old\n- Doctor\n",
    "Resolution": "Tamai helped Okawa and Sasaki become treasurers and secretary but couldn't win Maeda's heart, so Tamai joked about stealing money from the student council to teach her a lesson, but they actually did it. And then Tamai took responsibility and kept it a secret from her at the cost of their money. However, it is revealed that she knew Tamai did not steal the money all along because she was dating him when it happened.\nFirst of all, the culprits of the recent strange events targeting Tamai were Okawa and Sasaki, the two of them wanted him to reveal the truth about the robbery in the past, but Tamai refused, which made them very angry and pushed him into the river, the traces recorded on the two of them were the evidence. However, things did not stop there because Tamai did not die and swam to shore and talked to Maeda for a while before she knocked him into the pool and officially died.\n- On the day of his murder, Maeda did not have lunch at the antique restaurant because she cheerfully told her coworkers that she had brought her own lunch.\n- Bruises on the victim's back matched the letter on her purse.\nThe real reason she delivered the killing blow was because her husband refused to let her come out of retirement to cook for him… all for money. Before she was taken away, she called the other two murderers to follow her, and they all felt honored and followed her.\nBefore being taken away, she spread her arms out to indicate that the other two should go together. They felt honored and held hands, ending the case happily and honored. As for Kogoro, it was unclear whether it was a dream or reality when he was invited to eat jingisukan hotpot and squealed like a sheep as Conan described.\n",
