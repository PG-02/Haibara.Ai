    "Situation": "Haibara has a dream that Gin finds her. Later, after school, Conan and Haibara find Gin's car by chance. Conan plants a tracker in his car before he and Vodka take off. He then learns that Gin and Vodka are planning to eliminate someone, and already has a member named Pisco in the area. Gin then finds the tracker and destroys it, believing Sherry placed it there. Using the info they already gathered, Conan and Haibara rush to stop Pisco's mission from succeeding. Though, when they arrive, the lights go out, and a chandelier falls down, crashing on the target.\n\nThe police question everyone, and unable to maintain everyone as a suspect, the guests rush out the door. In the turmoil, Haibara is kidnapped by someone and confined to a liquor storage room.\n\nElsewhere, Gin and Vodka are on their way to the hotel. Haibara drinks paikaru, directed by Conan, in hopes that she'll be able to turn back into Shiho and climb out the chimney. Will she be able to escape in time before Gin and Vodka find her?\nGin and Vodka meet Shiho on the rooftop, already aware that she used the chimney to escape the wine cellar. There, the two shoot her down.\n\nConan arrives and shoots Gin with his needle, then distracts them with his bow-tie, turning their attention to his location. Shiho retreats, jumping back down the chimney before they're able to kill her. Conan escapes too. Gin shoots himself in the arm to remain alert, overcoming Conan's sleeping darts.\n",
    "People": "- 38 years old\n- Novelist\n- Tarumi's lover\n- 62 years old\n- Baseball team owner\n- 35 years old\n- Music producer\n- 29 years old\n- Actress\n- Victim (slashed - injured)\n- 58 years old\n- University professor\n- 71 years old\n- Auto manufacturer chairman\n- Victim (crushed)\n- 56 years old\n- Politician\n- 43 years old\n- Announcer\n- Deceased\n- Film director\n- Masterpiece work \"Rainbow colored handkerchief\"\n- Haido City Hotel waitress\n",
    "Resolution": "- The chandelier that fell on Nomiguchi was painted by florescent paint in advance on the chain area, allowing him to shoot it in the dark.\n- Similarly, Pisco marked the floor under the chandelier with florescent paint and lured Nomiguchi there by telling that he will help him escape before the police interrogate him tomorrow.\n- In order to hide the flash created when firing the gun, Pisco covered the silencer with his purple handkerchief. As colored handkerchiefs were given to all the guests at the party, it would be hard to prove the handkerchief's relation to murder even if it was found.\n- Unfortunately for Pisco, only seven guests with purple handkerchief remained at the party, including him, allowing Conan to narrow the list of suspects.\nBecause of the following reasons, Conan singles out Pisco as the only one capable of committing the crime.\n- Professor Yoshiharu Tawara and actress Chris Vineyard were within the radius of the falling chandelier which not only risk injuring themselves, but also making them incapable of firing at the chain that held the chandelier to the ceiling.\n- Baseball team owner Yasuo Mihei spitted out a piece of the chain painted with florescent, an incriminating evidence, is uncharacteristic for a murderer.\n- Announcer Naomichi Mugikura was unable to commit the crime due to him being on the stage and watched by all the guests.\n- Lastly, writer Mika Nanjo and music producer Naoya Tarumi were dancing/embracing with each others during the time of murder, establishing a solid alibi.\nPisco shoots the Polmos Spirytus Rektyfikowany 192 crate and spill from wooden box Ethanol fumes are set alight by Pisco's cigarette and the whole cellar catches fire. Conan and Haibara escape in the confusion, leaving Pisco to face Gin who arrive. Gin then kills Pisco.\n\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the anime version, the game with the boss' character is called The Great Adventures of Professor Agasa 2.\n- In the scene just before Conan gives Haibara his glasses, Shiho recalls her worst nightmare about Gin killing Conan, the Detective Boys, and the rest of her friends. In the manga, Gin's body and face are spattered with blood. The anime version removes the bloody spatter, presumably because of the implied violence.\n- In the anime, Chris Vineyard's name is mistakenly written as \"Chris Vinyard\" in the guestbook.\n- The anime version omits a brief questioning scene where the seven suspects that had purple handkerchiefs are being called for individually by Megure for interrogation. Vermouth looks out the window, presumably for Gin and Vodka who are about to arrive.\n- Conan's notebook diagram of the locations of the seven suspects at the time of the murder is different in the anime.\n- The anime omits Vodka shooting the lock out of the storage room with a silenced handgun.\n- In the newspaper picture that shows Pisco aiming at the chandelier, the figure is very difficult to see in the anime, which makes this clue nearly useless. The manga version shows the person's raised arm clearly.\n- In the manga, Vodka accurately shoots at the door where Conan is hiding at adult height. In the anime, the animators mistook the muzzle flashes of the gun for wall impacts and thus depicted Vodka shooting wildly.\n",
    "Remastered version": "On March 23, 2009, a remastered version of the case was aired. All three episodes were edited and combined into one hour long special, and scenes were edited out to fit the time slot. However, exclusive to the remastering new scenes were added to this version. In the beginning, Haibara types APTX 4869 into a program on a computer. She tells the story of the drug and she stills recall the day she and Conan encounter them. In the ending, Haibara deletes the typing and closes the program. She says that seems like enough information for whoever who is watching and mentions the watcher is now one of the people who knows their secret and is in danger now if the secret goes out, so the person should pray that nothing bad happens. She gets up from her chair then leaves, and Conan appears on the computer screen, saying that no matter what, he'll protect the watcher.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Haibara lied to Conan that the disk of copied APTX 4869 information was left behind and destroyed in the fire. In The Desperate Revival, the bloody floppy disk is hidden under a pile of disks by her computer when Ran comes to visit her.\n- The officer with glasses can speak English, and had to tell Megure what Chris Vineyard, an American actress, told him. In the credits scene, he was replaced by Yokoyama.\n- The name Shelling Ford input by Conan in the computer is supposed to be Arthur Conan Doyle's first planned name for Sherlock Holmes. Nevertheless, this name is proven to be wrong, as Sherlock's first prototype name was Sherrinford Holmes.\n- After Conan puts his glasses on Haibara, he says \"Nobody'll ever discover your identity if you wear those. Even Clark Kent would be surprised.\" This is an allusion to Clark Kent/Superman.\n- Conan wears a coat with a 'K' on it, which seems to be reference to his last name (Kudo).\n- This marks one of the few times that a person has been able to overcome Conan's tranquilizer dart.\n",
