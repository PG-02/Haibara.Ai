    "Situation": "Conan, Professor Agasa and the rest of the Detective Boys goes to a shrine ground to view Cherry blossom. There Conan meets up with Jodie to tell her that Scar Akai was Bourbon in disguise to test the FBI's reaction and find out if Akai is really dead. He futher tells her that Bourbon calls himself Tooru Amuro and works at Poirot under the detective agency.\nConan is worried because he doesn't know why Bourbon is staying despite that his mission being complete and asks the FBI to investigate him. During their conversation, a man who introduces himself as Tohei Benzaki butts in and asks Jodie if she is that foreign woman from the bank robbery case, futher saying that his wife was the woman who tied her up. He says that he had seen the scarred man a few days ago, but can't remember where, because he had a cold.\n\nConan finds three black fem-yens placed near the victim's hand and recognize them as the signature act of Kurobee, a pickpocker known for leaving those three black coins in her victim's pockets, rumored to be a mocking thank you to the victims for earning money the pickpocker steals from them. He goes through the victim's belongings and discovers that victim herself was Kurobee due to the fact that she had a purse filled with black coins. He also finds a GPS wrapped in bills, coming to the conclusion that most likely Kurobee was killed by one of her own victims.\n\n\n\n\nThe Detective Boys finds four wallets that Kurobee had pickpocketed in order to identify her victims. Excluding Jodie, who has an alibi, since she stayed with Conan, there is three suspects left, Tohei Benzaki, Yoriko Danno and Shigemori Sakamaki. All three of them have three black five-yens in their possession, which is odd, since Conan thought that the ones left near the victim's body meant that the killer was left with none.\n",
