    "People": "- Victim (bludgeoned)\n- 72 years old\n- Famous painter\n- 33 years old\n- Seiho's apprentice\n- 60 years old\n- Seiho's wife\n- 55 years old\n- Housekeeper\n- 26 years old\n- Seiho's apprentice\n- Mitsuboshi Department Store clerk\n- Mitsuboshi Department Store clerk\n- Okuho Lake resident\n- Retiree\n- Okuho Lake Train Station employee\n- Old man's pet dog\n",
    "Resolution": "\nHe waited for the sign to change since it changes when the train is supposed to depart even if it hasn't and boarded the train making people suspect he took the train at 2:02 PM which would make sense that he couldn't have killed Seiho. Because he boarded the 1:17 PM train, he was able to take the express train from Aohata Station at 1:55 PM which would leave him just enough time to commit his crime. He then struck Seiho with the bust and killed him. Obliged to confess, he tells it wasn't his fault since he made people pay in exchange for selecting them as winners and Daiki couldn't afford it and always lost. Megure then tells Daiki even if he was passionate for painting and to make children happy, he betrayed the children that modeled for him. He deceived his audience and used them to commit a murder. Nishiyama then regrets his actions and starts to cry.\n",
    "Trivia": "- One of the police cars in the parking of the victim's studio is a Toyota HiAce Fifth generation 2014. It has the same license plate has two police cars in Mystery of the Burning Tent and The Job Request from Inspector Megure.\n- The busts in Seiho's workshop are digitized pictures. One of the busts represents French playwright Molière.\n- The surnames of the characters are based on the different cardinal positions on Earth: Kengo Higashio (東尾 where the 東 intends to mean East - Higashi), Kinuko and Seiho Kitasono (北園 where the 北 intends to mean North - Kita), Daiki Nishiyama (西山 where the 西 intends to mean West - Nishi) and Shizu Minamida (南田 where the 南 intends to mean South - Minami).\n- A slight production mistake occur in the episode when, in the scene Takagi talks to Megure in the woods, we can notice that the background had been cut.\n- The Cheetah Delivery company reappears in this episode.\n"
