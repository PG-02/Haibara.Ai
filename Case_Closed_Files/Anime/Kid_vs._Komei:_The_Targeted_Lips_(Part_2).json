    "People": "- 45 years old\n- Jewelry broker\n- Lends Fairy's Lip to Jirokichi\n- 21 years old\n- Company employee\n- Fairy's Lip's true owner's granddaughter\n- Kaitou Kid's disguise\n- Jirokichi's advisor\n- Tokyo MPD Police officer\n- Tokyo MPD Police officer\n- Tokyo MPD Police officer\n- Tokyo MPD Police officer\n",
    "Resolution": "While everyone are resting in the library, Kid (as Kazuha) sneaks out to check the ice which already melted to center and asks a guard that he want to search something. He picks the Fairy's Lip, but suddenly cornered by the team of officers and guards. It is revealed that they wanted to catch Kid in action.\nHowever, Kid escapes and returns the Fairy's Lip to its true owner Moena Yamamoto and tells the story of how her grandfather was given the Fairy's Lip.\nIt is also revealed by Heiji that Naeji Torigoe is a fake owner and got him arrested, since he lied about the location of the pearl's kind. He probably read online the story of how the owner's grandfather got the pearl from a billionaire in gratitude for helping his wife giving birth safely, and decided to swindle the pearl from the owner. Even though Heiji wasn't able to identify the fake Kazuha until the end, when asked by the real one, he says that he did realize that since the fake one didn't have seaweed stuck in her mouth.\n",
    "Aftermath": "",
    "Trivia": "- This is the last episode where Kosei Tomita voices Jirokichi Suzuki, as he passed away after a stroke on September 27, 2020.\n- This is the first time Heiji meets Kaitou Kid in person canonically, both disguised and undisguised. Previous to this, they met in The Private Eyes' Requiem and Follow the Vanished Diamond! Conan & Heiji vs. Kid!.\n- The names of the suspects are a clue to whom the jewel really belongs to[2]:\n- Naeji Torigoe (鳥越 苗路) contains the characters \"鳥\" and \"路\", which when combined together read as heron, \"Sagi\" (鷺). \"Sagi\" also means \"fraud\" (詐欺).\n- On the other hand, Moena Yamamoto (山本 萌奈) comes from \"Hon'namono\" (本なもの), which means \"real thing\", as her name contains \"本\" and \"na\", as well as \"mo\" from \"mono\".\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- Moena Yamamoto has blonde hair in the manga, while the anime changed her hair to black.\n- In the manga, Ran is the one who questions if Heiji has really recognised that Kazuha is Kaito KID (as Heiji and Kazuha go together to see the sleeping quarters) which prompts Conan and Kogorou to rush after them. But this clue is removed in the anime.\n",

    "Cast (flashback and new scenes)": "On March 30, 2024, a remastered version of the episode was aired to promote The Million-dollar Pentagram. The two episodes were edited and combined into one hour-long special, along with some OST changes and additional content:\nIn the beginning, Heiji recaps some of his past moments with Kazuha in the past. The scenes from the past include:\n- Episode 118: The Naniwa Serial Murder Case\n- Episode 324: Heiji Hattori's Desperate Situation! (Part 2)\n- Episode 764: Conan and Heiji, Code of Love (Part 2)\nAfter the end credits, a new scene is added. In it, Heiji approaches Kazuha in the middle of the flower field. They then begin to kiss each other. Fortunately, before their lips meet, Heiji opens his eyes and is surprised that Kaitou Kid is in Kazuha's place instead.\nThis is revealed to be a dream, as he daydreams while researching places for the confession. Then he gets a call from Kazuha, reminding him they have plans to get okonomiyaki with Mikiko Hiramoto. But their sounds are loud enough that people at the library start looking at Heiji. So he quickly takes the books and leaves the library, dropping one book without realizing it. The book opens on a page about Hakodate, famous for its \"One million dollar night view.\"\nUnlike other remastered episodes, this is labeled as \"SP1\" on the official website, and Crunchyroll, which usually skipped remasters, simulcasted the episode.\nNew Scene Staff\n- Storyboard / Technical Director: Nobuharu Kamanaka\n- Animation Director: Kyoko Yoshimi\n- Key Animation: Ayu Imoto, Emi Kojima\n- In-between Director: Rie Hisagi\n- Color Coordination/Finishing Check: Fusako Nakao (wish)\n- Background Art: Ayami Yamaguchi (Bihou)\n- Production Advancement: Runan Koyanagi\n",
