    "Situation": "Nichiuri TV celebrates the opening of their new office building in Osaka and announce the production of the movie \"Kaiju Gomera vs. Kamen Yaiba\" by Taiho Pictures. Conan, Kogoro, Ran, the Detective Boys, Heiji and Kazuha are all there to take part in the filming as extras. TV producer Yonekura gets killed when a large monster action figure falls on him in the warehouse. Conan and Heiji deduce there were two culprits and that they are his subordinates Mihara and Kouchi, who killed Yonekura for taking credit for their work. Mihara and Kouchi try to escape arrest in Yonekura's car but Mihara is stopped by police. Kouchi drives off and crashes the car into a river. A bomb in the car goes off and kills him.\n\n\n\nThe next day, Fumimaro Ayanokoji joins the investigation as Yonekura was connected to a scriptwriter Onda, who died in Kyoto the day before Yonekura's death when he drove off a cliff. Onda drives a red car on even days and a blue car on odd days but he died in the red car on an even day. Yonekura and Onda worked together on an independent film 20 years ago. A third death occurs in Suemura, an employee of Taiho Pictures, when a bomb explodes at an abandoned warehouse. Suemura was also a part of Yonekura's team 20 years ago. The bomb used matches the one that was in Yonekura's car and the police suspect a bomb was also used in Onda's death. They learn of a fourth member of the team 20 years ago in Katsuji Ishizawa and look for him only to find him bound and gagged in the kitchen of his own home.\n\n\nIshizawa's brought to a hospital. He had been starved for two to three days with bruises all over. Conan and Kogoro investigate Ishizawa's residence. They deduce Ishizawa was locked in his room on the second floor, broke out and fell down the stairs but couldn't explain why he didn't go outside for help. Conan notices a newspaper in the entranceway with a story on Yonekura's death. Conan meets with Haibara, who tells Conan about how Yonekura, Onda and Suemura all paid off their debts ten years ago and, at around the same time, there was an unsolved robbery of 120 million yen by a four-man group. Also, before his death, Onda was close to bankruptcy after failed investments. Conan deduces the robbery was committed by Yonekura's team and the deaths were due to a falling out but can't work out the culprit. Conan considers the possibility that Yonekura killed Onda after being blackmailed but he couldn't explain why Yonekura's car had a bomb. Haibara suspects Ishizawa staged his confinement but Conan didn't find evidence of that. Conan couldn't explain why a bomb was only planted in one of Onda's two cars or why the bomb in Yonekura's car had no timer or detonator.\n\n\n\n",

    "Resolution": "Conan deduces Yonekura was behind the bombings and the plan was to kill Onda, Ishizawa and Suemura on the same day to make his alibi. Yonekura could have directed Suemura to the warehouse and the bomb in his car was actually explosives yet to be made into a bomb, presumably for killing and framing Ishizawa or for setting off at the airport carpark to make it look like he was also a target but escaped death on account of being on a business trip and not in the car. But Onda's death happened a day earlier than expected when his blue car broke down and he had to drive the red one. Seeing the news of this distressed Yonekura to the point that he couldn't avoid being killed. This also threw off the rest of his plan. Ishizawa couldn't ask for help due to the risk of the robbery coming to light.\nHeiji finds a home video at the Onda residence showing there was a fifth man on the team. The fifth man was Katsuji Ishizawa's brother Koichi. Heiji and Conan set up Katsuji to lead them to Koichi. Koichi says he was supposed to be working as a guard at Abeno Harukas for an event related to the Gomera/Yaiba movie. Yonekura set it up for him. Heiji and Conan realize there are two bombs there and that Ran, Kazuha and the Detective Boys are there too. Heiji and Conan get there and find one of the bombs on the terrace but the other one is inside with Kazuha and Ran. They communicate over the phone and deactivate both bombs together.\n",
