    "Situation": "A man named Tatsuo Mori uses his physical resemblance to Kogoro Mouri to impersonate him at a traditional hotel near a creepy forest, probably inspired by the real Aokigahara Forest, where he is invited to investigate a case where a man is said to have committed suicide four-five years ago. Kogoro goes there without knowing about the double. On the way the trio is picked up by Detective Yamamura. Yamamura tells them about a man who committed suicide four-five years ago. There were a lot of strange things about the body. It had car keys, but no drivers license, cigarettes, but no lighter, and it was wearing a red winter coat, despite that a recipe, proved that he died in summer. Kogoro explains that the inn owner has hired him to investigate a mystery. Five years ago a long-haired man wearing a red coat arrived and paid the owner to keep a letter and a briefcase for him for a year. The instructions were that if the long-haired man came back, he should give him the briefcase, if someone else comes, the owner shall give him the letter. The day after another man came and ask for the briefcase. The owner gave him the letter as told to, and the man became mad upon reading it, torn it to pieces and left and was never seen again. The owner pieced together the letter, on which were written in red 'I kill you with my curse'. When they all arrive, they learn of the double. Kogoro is first enraged, but then he decides to play along and not reveal his identity. Later that night, Tatsuo is found hanged in his room.\n\n\nConan reveals that it is a murder and that it relates to the suicide incident five years ago.\n",
    "People": "- 58 years old\n- Aoiya inn owner\n- Kogoro's client\n- Victim (hanged)\n- Kogoro Mouri's imposter\n- 34 years old\n- Aoiya staff\n- 37 years old\n- Aoiya staff\n- Deceased (hanged)\n- A long-haired man wearing a red coat\n",
    "Resolution": "\nJinbo decided the only way he could obtain the money now was to employ himself as a worker at said inn. Few years later he discovered a suicide body and stole cigarettes, milk and recipe from it and planted it on his dead partner's body to create a false time of death, when the body would be discovered. When he learn that the inn owner would get Kogoro to investigate the mystery, he hired Tatsuo Mori to retrieve the brief-case, under the impression he would get paid. Discovering that there was only a sumo magazine, that actually contained hints to the treasure's location, Tatsuo felt double crossed and threatened to tell the real Kogoro everything once he arrived. Jinbo killed Tatsuo to keep him silent, then managed to discover the treasure's location, thanks to hints from Conan, before getting caught. It turns out that Jinbo had given himself away right from the start. When Kogoro and the others arrived, and no one knew that Kogoro was the real Sleeping Kogoro or had even met Detective Yamamura before, Jinbo had approached him with Ran's cell phone saying 'Is this your daughter's' after seeing the sticker with Ran's full name on it. Hence Jinbo had revealed that he knew from the start that that Kogoro was the real Sleeping Kogoro.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Misao Yamamura's car is a green 1999 Toyota FunCargo [XP20].\n- After learning of his imposter, Kogoro gave the name Echigo Mitsuemon, which is a reference to Mito Kōmon, a TV drama character based off famous Japanese feudal lord Tokugawa Mitsukuni.\n- At the end of the case, talking to some fangirls, Kogoro said that his name was \"Toyama Kingoro\", a mash-up of his own name and Tōyama no Kin-san, a TV show character based off famous samurai Tōyama Kagemoto.\n",
