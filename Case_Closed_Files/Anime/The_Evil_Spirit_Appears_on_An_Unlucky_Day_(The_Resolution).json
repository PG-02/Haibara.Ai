    "Situation": "A man from Suruga, Shizuoka Prefecture, is being haunted by a ghost, since exorcisms did not work they want Kogoro to solve the case. The clue is a card that says the fifth ghost will kill them unless they repent their sins. Since the time that card was sent, the master installed a door that needs a pin code and fingerprint scan to access the top floor. The master, lady, and the installer of the door are friends who are hiding a secret about the sin. All the accidents happen on Butsumetsu day, the day Buddha dies and the unluckiest day on Earth. On that day the installer was found hanged on the balcony of the third floor.\n\nThe master was not home so the door could not have been opened.\nAfterwards, the master is found dead from a heart attack.\n\nConan realizes he must've seen something that was impossible causing him that much of a fright.\nThey decide to investigate the four workers of the mansion along with the accident that took place thirteen years ago.\n",
    "People": "- 50 years old\n- Kunitomo family butler\n- OCD (perfectionist)\n- 28 years old\n- Kunitomo family chauffeur\n- Germaphobe\n- 28 years old\n- Kunitomo family chef\n- Acrophobic\n- 52 years old\n- Kunitomo family housekeeper\n- Namika's mother\n- Aichmophobic\n- 42 years old\n- Kunitomo family lady\n- Victim (hanged)\n- 43 years old\n- Security company president\n- Victim (heart attack)\n- 56 years old\n- Kunitomo family head\n- Deceased (accident)\n- Shigeko's husband\n- Namika's father\n- Kunitomo family previous chef\n- Deceased (accident)\n- Masashi's father\n- Kunitomo family previous driver\n- Deceased (accident)\n- Kenzo's wife\n- Kunitomo family maid\n- Deceased (accident)\n- Masashi's twin brother\n- Would be 28 if alive\n",
    "Resolution": "- The fingerprints found on the rope and the master's medicine bottle do not match with any of the suspects', meaning that there must be an accomplice for the two murders.\n- Shigeko's calendar consist of birthdays of the mansion's residents, but there are only eight marks on the calendar despite there being 9 people.\n- Namika testified that Watabiki has a scar from many years ago when he caught her she fell from a tree, but no scar was seen on Watabiki's hand when Conan, Kogoro, and Ran first arrived at the mansion.\n- Watabiki's schedule marks on the calendar have two distinct patterns for each of the brothers' chores, allowing them to hide the younger brother's presence in mansion for their murder plan. Because Watabiki always wears gloves due to his Hygienic personality there would be no need to fear of his brother's fingerprints appearing except when washing the dishes, hence the need to knock down the cupboard and destroy them.\n- For the first murder, the younger brother first drove the Master and the Mistress to hospital to create an alibi, while Watabiki who hid in the house went to the third floor and murdered Sekuguchi. Afterward, to remove the rest of the household members from suspicion, he hung Sekiguchi's body at the balcony and placed the card inside his shirt pocket.\n- For the murder of Atsuhiro, Watabiki pretended to request an appointment with him. Since he was the only servant with an alibi at the time of murder, the Master lowered his guard and let him in. The two brothers then appeared in front of him with an exact same appearance, sending the Master into shock and causing him to die from heart attack.\n- After planting his fingerprints on the bottle, the younger brother planned to escape from the estate by using the rope to get down from the 3rd floor balcony. Due to Conan's intervention, one of the brothers was forced to hide in the room on the third floor, utilizing the switch trick to keep up the illusion. Afterward, the other brother would then hide outside on one of the balconies.\nWatabiki and his brother murdered Sekiguchi, Atsuhiro, and presumably targeted Yasue due to them fleeing the sinking ship while leaving the younger brother, their father, Mr.Senzaki, and Mrs. Akatsuka behind to drown. On that day, in which Sekiguchi unexpectedly joined the trip, the younger brother found out that Sekiguchi intended to dump the corpse of the previous president of his company into the ocean, whom he had killed in order to take over company. When he informed the crew, Sekiguchi fought with his father and caused the ship to capsize, throwing everyone into the ocean. Sekiguchi then used the lifeboat to pickup only Atsuhiro and Yasue, making him believe that the master and mistress were in on it as well.\nAt this point, Yasue reveals that she and Atsuhiro did indeed try to call for help, but Sekiguchi blackmailed them into silence else he would wrongly inform the police that the two of them are his accomplices/accessories in the murder/accident. The younger brother being the strongest among those stranded tried to reach the shore, but he lost consciousness and when he awoke in the hospital and had lost his memories after he had been rescued. He escaped from the hospital and wandered around on the streets until he ran into Watabaki one day and regained his memories, motivating the brothers to commit the crime.\n\nBecause Sekiguchi falsified the location of where the boat sunk during the interrogation, its remains was never found. However, the clue of its true location is marked on his watch in order to use it to keep extorting Atsuhiro and Yasue. With this, the police are finally able to locate the remains of the ship and the former president’s corpse, closing the case once and for all.\n- Deceased (murdered)\n- Missing for 13 years\n- Previous president of Sekiguchi's security company\n",
    "Trivia": "- Masashi Watabiki's vehicle is a blue mica 1997 Toyota Century [GZG50] with a 92-10 license plate.\n- The modified versions of Michelangelo's The Creation of the Sun, Moon and Vegetation and Delphic Sibyl in the Kunimoto household are from the mansion in The Mysterious Angel's Mansion.\n- In the last part of the case, the ending was changed to Thank You For Everything.\n",
