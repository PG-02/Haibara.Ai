    "Situation": "Ran just won a trip to Kanazawa and decides to go there along with Kogoro and Conan.\nThere, they meet a mysterious lady, Mari Hayashi, who reveals herself to be quite rich. They help her get to the location she wants and later head there by themselves. As they arrive, they see a robber trying to steal the heavy bag Mari was carrying and rapidly stop him. As they ask her about the bag's contents, she just nods and goes away. Later, they meet her again and ask her where was her bag as she was walking empty-handed. She reveals to them that Manabu Saikawa, who works for her family has been kidnapped and that the bag had the ransom money, 30 Million Yen. The four of them then go to the ransom location to find out the money has been taken.\n\nAfter going to the Hayashis' house to investigate, Kogoro gathers all suspects to reveal that Saikawa staged his own kidnapping so he could get the money. Saikawa then angrily throws the bag at them and runs away.\n\nThe next morning, the police carries Soichi away and tell the people involved that Soichi will recover. Kogoro and Conan find some gold dust on the crime scene and deduce that Takumi Kondo might be involved with it since he works in gold crafting. Kondo reveals he only went to meet him and didn't hit him. Back at the house, they receive a call saying that Rintaro Hagino was kidnapped. By listening to the call, Conan deduces they have to go to Komatsu, which has the only airport in the area and that Hagino must be held captive there. At the train station's entrance, Conan and Ran stumble across Saikawa, who was trying to go by undetected and they chase him to a house where Kogoro is in front of, having been given the authority to bring Hagino's ransom money.\n\nThey arrive at the house along with Kaede, Kondo, Mari and the police which have been called to come. Kogoro finds Hagino and unties him asking him where was Saikawa. There, Conan stuns Kogoro with his wristwatch to expel the truth.\n",
