    "Resolution": "Udagawa had modified his clothing to be reversible, which is why he didn’t take off his coat because the backside's colour of the coat is yellow - the colour of the culprit's coat and his trouser's backside is red - the colour of culprit's trouser. He also modified the mask he was wearing, so that he could wear as underwear to hide the evidence. He also put the cathartic into Kanzaki's tea so that Shimomura was forced to be the Beikapon giving him an opportunity to kill him.\n"
