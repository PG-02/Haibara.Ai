    "Situation": "While fishing, Conan and with the Detective Boys spot a sniper shooting a balloon tied to a remote controlled boat on the river. This sniper is held at gunpoint by other men.\n\nThe Detective Boys go to find these men but when they get there, the gunmen have left.\nConan finds a calculator under a small concrete block which he believes was left behind by the sniper. Kogoro, Ran, and Conan, joined by the Detective Boys, find a stretch of road that mirrors the river used for the test. They call the police and find out that the sniper, Koichi Yamabe, and his girlfriend, Eri, were recently reported missing. However, while waiting for the criminals to arrive at the supposed sniping spot, Conan realizes that the numbers on the calculator, when read upside down, spell out a different message entirely.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (abducted)\n- Tokyo police officer\n- Former olympic medalist in rifle shooting\n- Victim (abducted)\n- Koichi's girlfriend\n- Tiger gang member\n- Tiger gang member\n- Tiger gang leader\n- Tiger gang member\n\n- District attorney\n- Tiger gang's target\n- Man E's wife\n- Man E's first son\n- Elementary school boy\n- Man E's second son\n- Elementary school boy\n- Heisei Express train passenger\n- Heisei Express train passenger\n- Heisei Express train passenger\n",
    "Resolution": "- The sniper left behind a calculator with the numbers 3,135,134,162 on the screen.\n- The sniper's test was held at about one o'clock in the afternoon.\n- When Ran suggested that the numbers 162 might be a road, Kogoro declared that the shape of the river might be similar to the bends of the road for the sniping site.\n- When Conan saw the numbers upside down when Mitsuiko was typing them into a calculator, the numbers could be read as \"291 Heisei E\".\nThe sniper that Conan saw was Koichi Yamabe, a police officer and former rifle marksman of Japan's Olympic team. He and his girlfriend, Eri, were abducted by the criminals while on vacation. The criminals held Eri hostage so that Koichi would work for them.\nWhen the criminals didn't arrive at the site on Saitama Route 162, Conan and the Detective Boys tried reexamining the code. As Mitsuhiko punched in the numbers into his calculator, Conan accidentally saw that when upside down, the numbers can be read as \"291 Heisei E\". The decoded message points to the one o'clock train on February 9th of the Heisei Express train. The shape of the river turns out to mirror a double-curve in the train tracks of the Express. The criminals want Koichi to shoot someone inside the train and the balloon was just an accuracy test.\n\nConan sneaks into the helicopter taking Inspector Megure to the train line. Before Koichi can assassinate the target, Inspector Megure instructs the pilot to swoop down and distract the criminals. Conan uses his Power-Enhancing Kick Shoes to kick his helmet towards their leader before he can shoot Koichi. Koichi is able to take down the remaining criminals and save Eri from harm.\n\n",
    "Trivia": "- The Heisei Express train in real-life is the Keisei Express train named the Keisei AE series (1972).\n- Megure, Ran, Kogoro, and the Detective Boys delivery van is a 1986 Toyota Quick Delivery 200.\n",
    "Translation changes": "- While Eri is merely Koichi's girlfriend, the Funimation changes their relationship to husband and wife.\n- The names of the characters and places in the Funimation Dub are:\n- Heisei Express - Soho Express\n- Route 162 - Highway 162\n- Kyoto - Ruffleton\n- Koichi Yamabe - Charles Mulligan\n- Eri - Erin Mulligan\n"
