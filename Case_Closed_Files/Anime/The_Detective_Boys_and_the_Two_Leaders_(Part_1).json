    "Trivia": "- A \"towelket\" refers to a towel that can be also used as a blanket. The material, usually cotton or linen, absorbs the humidity well in the summer and it is thus a substitute for a blanket[1].\n- The van used by Okiya, Wakasa and the Detective Boys is a white, 5th generation Toyota HiAce.\n- The names of the suspects, when combining their first and last names, are related to \"food you can buy at the beach\"[2] :\nSakura Menda (免田 朔良) comes from \"ramen\" ;\nMaika Kayaki (茅木 舞香) comes from \"grilled squid\" (いか焼き ,ikayaki?) ;\nTakaki Kooriyama (郡山 貴起) comes from \"shaved ice\" (かき氷 ,kakigōri?) ;\nKatsunori Usui (碓井 克徳) comes from \"watermelon\" (すいか ,suika?) ;\nReisuke Kayaki (茅木 玲輔) comes from \"curry\" (カレー ,karē?).\n- Sakura Menda (免田 朔良) comes from \"ramen\" ;\n- Maika Kayaki (茅木 舞香) comes from \"grilled squid\" (いか焼き ,ikayaki?) ;\n- Takaki Kooriyama (郡山 貴起) comes from \"shaved ice\" (かき氷 ,kakigōri?) ;\n- Katsunori Usui (碓井 克徳) comes from \"watermelon\" (すいか ,suika?) ;\n- Reisuke Kayaki (茅木 玲輔) comes from \"curry\" (カレー ,karē?).\n- Sakura Menda (免田 朔良) comes from \"ramen\" ;\n- Maika Kayaki (茅木 舞香) comes from \"grilled squid\" (いか焼き ,ikayaki?) ;\n- Takaki Kooriyama (郡山 貴起) comes from \"shaved ice\" (かき氷 ,kakigōri?) ;\n- Katsunori Usui (碓井 克徳) comes from \"watermelon\" (すいか ,suika?) ;\n- Reisuke Kayaki (茅木 玲輔) comes from \"curry\" (カレー ,karē?).\n",
