    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan arrive in Hiroshima to meet a film crew whom plan to film them touring Miyajima, Hiroshima. The assistant producer, Yuichi Kitamura, gets a severe stomach pain that causes him to be bedridden. They take a ferry to Miyajima and begin filming. In front of Itsukushima Shrine, a crew member finds out salt was added to his drink. The film crew then notice a familiar man in a crowd and assume him to be at fault. One of the crew tells Conan that man may be probing the crew since it is suspected one of them is running an illegal casino. The film crew arrives at a red-leaf bun pastry shop owned by Yayoi Ayase which has a specialty of red-leaf bun called Misen's Seven Wonders, based on the seven wonders of Mount Misen: The eternal flame of Daishō-in, The plum tree grown from Kūkai's khakkhara, a boulder that ebb and flows the salt water of Hiroshima Bay, a boulder inscribed with Kūkai's writing, the sound of a goblin's clapping, a special cherry blossom that undergoes deciduous all season long, and and lights dubbed as dragon fire over Hiroshima Bay. Conan notices a photograph depicting the crew members in the past and is told the crew were in Miyajima two years ago for filming. He then notices the man spotted at the shrine in another picture who is revealed to be Shinroku Ayase, Yayoi's brother. Yayoi explains her parents fell to their death on Misen two years prior and Shinroku investigated the cause. Two weeks ago, he disappears for unknown reasons. As the filming continues, a crew member finds his ring tone has been changed to clappers and another has been thrown an etched rock.\n\nConan relates these to the seven wonders and explains the salted drink is related to the ebb and flow boulder, and Kitamura's cherry blossom tie is related to Misen's cherry blossom tree. A crew is is found bludgeoned with a khakkhara and Yayoi's bakery is set ablaze. The witnesses claims it is the work of Shinroku.\n\n\nRealizing only the wonder left is the dragon fire, the film crew decide to let Kogoro investigate in order to stop Shinroku before he attacks them again. As they learn more about Shinroku, the director is stabbed with a dragon designed dagger and hospitalized as a result.\n\n",
