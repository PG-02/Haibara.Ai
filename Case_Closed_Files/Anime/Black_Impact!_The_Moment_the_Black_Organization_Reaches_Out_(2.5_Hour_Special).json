    "Characters introduced": "- 27 years old\n- TV announcer\n- Assassin\n- Member of the Black Organization\n- Assassin\n- Member of the Black Organization\n- Chianti's partner\n- 8 years old\n- Elementary child\n",

    "Case 1": "",
    "Situation": "\n",
    "Resolution": "\n\"Bein\" B turns out to be Vane B, as weather vane; The Black Organization will stop Domon's car at Toriya (bird) bridge. Knowing where the Organization is heading, the FBI manages to corner Rena, which results in her being seriously injured. Gin calls the second plan off when he discovers Conan's tracker and suspects Kogoro of planting it. With the boss's permission he, Vodka, Vermouth, Korn and Chianti go Beika city to silence the detective.\n\n",
    "Case 2": "",
    "People": "- Deisan-kai member\n- Teito University Pharmaceutical professor\n- Actor\n- Former higher-up from Self Defense Force\n- US Senate candidate\n",
    "Remastered version": "A remastered version of this case was aired on March 19, 2016 and March 26, 2016 and April 2, 2016 and April 9, 2016. The original 2.5-hour episode was split into four smaller episodes.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- The scenes where Chianti and Korn are shown practicing their sniping skill with virtual targets and Vermouth observing Kiriko Busujima at the beginning of the anime episode are not from the original manga.\n- In addition, a scene with a shadow looking Rena's apartment, which has been revealed that it was Jodie spying Rena Mizunashi, and a hint that was Kimiwa, found in the adjoining apartment, and that was actually Miwako Takagi was written by Detective Takagi while observed a suspect's girlfriend, both are also exclusive from anime.\n- When Jodie shoots the sprinklers to stop the Black Organization snipers, Kir hears the silenced gunshots. In the manga, Kir just turns her head slightly to see the broken sprinkler. In the anime, she turns her whole body towards the sprinkler in order to look which was an animation mistake. Her pin is a camera and would have broadcast the video of Jodie and the broken sprinkler to Gin, Vodka and Vermouth.\n- There is a recap in the beginning of the anime version.\n",
    "Quotes": "- James Black (talking to Jodie in the car with Conan in the backseat):\nAs expected of the child that you have yours eyes on. It almost makes me want to scout him for the bureau.\n",
    "Trivia": "- During the recording of this episode, Ikue Otani had to temporarily left work for maternity leave, so remaining Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya lines was voiced by Ai Orikasa. She continued voicing Mitsuhiko until the Information Gathered About the Detective Boys episode.\n- Akai's scope shot against Gin is evidently a silent hommage to the most notorious accomplishment of Carlos Hathcock, a famed US Marine sniper who served in the Vietnam War.\n- Akai's Accuracy International Arctic Warfare rifle is a right handed version. By shooting it left-handed, operating the right-side bolt would be very clumsy and the spent cartridge would be ejected towards his face rather than away.\n- The recap in the beginning references Roller Coaster Murder Case, The Girl from the Black Organization and the University Professor Murder Case, The Black Organization: One Billion Yen Robbery Case, Reunion with the Black Organization, Head-to-Head Match with the Black Organization: A Dual Mystery on a Full Moon Night, and The Four Porsches.\n- In one of the scenes where Chianti and Korn are practicing their sniping skills, all the signs are misspelled as \"Sanate\" instead of \"Senate\".\n- In one scene, Professor Agasa drove by a direction sign bearing the names Ogata, Takayama and Hayashibara. This may be a reference to Kenichi Ogata, Minami Takayama and Megumi Hayashibara, the voice actors for Professor Agasa, Conan and Haibara respectively.\n- Tatsuzo Watanuki in Sonoko's Red Handkerchief is from the same yakuza group as Kiriko Busujima, Deisan-kai.\n- This is the last episode to be released in Japanese VHS.\n- Different vehicles used by characters:\n- Vermouth's 2003 Harley Davidson V Rod;\n- Domon's bodyguard's horizon blue metallic 2006 Mercedes-Benz S-Klasse [W221];\n- Tim's old grey metallic 1999 Volvo S80 T6 Gen.1 [TS];\n- FBI Agent Blue metallic 2006 Lexus GS [S190];\n- Kir's yellow 2005 Yamaha XG 250 Tricker.\n- Different Prototype vehicles:\n- The Back View sportcar is 2005 Nissan GT-R Proto Concept;\n- Red 2005 Mitsubishi Concept-X.\n- Yoko Okino has a pink cellphone.\n- Rena has a dark blue cell phone with a yellow or gold cellphone case.\n- Sniper range of the following snipers: Chianti is 600 yards, Korn is 550 yards, although he may also have 600 yards too, however only 550 yards is shown, and Shuichi Akai is 700 yards at least.\n",
