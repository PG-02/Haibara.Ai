    "Situation": "Shinichi eventually manages to take part to the Kyoto trip with Ran and their friends, thanks to the series of antidotes Haibara gave Conan. Each time Conan takes an antidote, he has to wait 8 hours after the back shrinking before taking another one. Shinichi and Ran secretly hope that Ran will give an answer to Shinichi's love declaration back in London. On the Kiyomizu-Dera, Shinichi meets Keiko, an actress and old friend of his mother, who stays in the same hotel as Shinichi and his class, with some university friends with which she shot a blockbuster revolving around a tengu and other monsters. She asks Shinichi to help her to decipher a mysterious code written and sent by their late friend Michio Dekuri, who committed suicide some time ago. The code was received by Nishiki, the movie's screenwriter, along with red aralia leaves, typical from Kyoto. Shinichi tries to solve it, while enjoying Kyoto with his friends, in particular Masumi, who knows Conan is Shinichi but still keeps it a secret. The group of friends visit Kyoto's temples and their gruesome crimson ceilings, that were at first the temple's floors spilled with the blood of samurais who committed mass suicide/seppuku and left many footprints, it was so astounding that the floors were kept and turned into ceilings.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Resolution": "\nShinichi, Heiji, and Masumi tell the killer his plan failed, and reveal him to be Riki Agata. The three teenagers say they solved the code: Dekuri's symbol was actually to be considered as a compass, and according to it, and the code's kanji characters' position, and the fact that these characters were extracted from some of Kyoto's streets' and districts' names corresponding to the position, the code can be understood as a succession of kanji characters who correspond to the first or second syllables of the streets' or districts' names they originate from.\nFor instance \"kon\" for \"kontaka\", etc., from left to right. The first lines of each code then read \"koro sunoha\", which means \"I'm about to kill\". Heiji says the reversed \"saki\" kanji means its corresponding character, \"pon\", is to be reversed to \"npo\", then \"n\". The first code accordingly means \"I'm going to kill three people, the first one being the screenwriter\". The second reads \"I'm going to kill two more people, the next one being the leading role\". And the third is \"I'm going to kill one more person, then I'll jump off the balcony\". In fact, Agata wanted to kill Mayama and frame him as the murderer and that he had committed suicide after he failed to kill Agata.\nAgata had beforehand booked all of the hotel's smoking rooms and checked one out for Nishiki just as the latter was phoning the hotel. In this room, Agata had previously painted the ceiling red with fake blood splatters and footprints. He then stuck magnetic post-its (similar to Nishiki's ones) over the whole ceiling in order to conceal it, the post-its being of the same color as the ceiling. After killing Nishiki, Agata unstuck all post-its and threw them away on the floor, mixing them up with Nishiki's own post-its.\nHe then opened the window and sprayed some of Nishiki's blood with a syringe on the fake blood traces, to pretend he had indeed been murdered on the ceiling by a tengu. Agata, a plastic art expert, also made a fake tengu out of guncotton and used alcohol-ink marker pens to draw on it. He then pasted the very light piece of artwork on his room's ceiling, screamed, pretending to be assaulted by a monster, and threw the ashtray with his lit cigarette in it at the tengu's face to have it explode, burn and vanish into thin air, as this is how guncotton reacts to fire. He had lit his cigarette not long ago to do so, explaining the only 3-centimeter burn patterns left by his cigarette on the floor, that should have been longer if he'd been smoking for a longer period of time.\nAgata had also prepared the restaurant's inuyarai by previously painting it red with the usual traces, but covering it with another inuyarai. After he killed Ihaya, he removed the cover inuyarai, threw away his bloody glove, dagger and coat into it and put it over another restaurant's inuyarai. He hadn't left any fingerprints on the bloody things for the police still to believe Mayama was the murderer.\nShinichi had noticed the dust gap around the first inuyarai, implying it had been covered by something that protected it from dust. Lastly, to frighten Mayama into pinning himself against the railing, Agata used a directional loudspeaker only Mayama could hear, with Dekuri's voice, and had previously painted transparent sheets with red footprints and stuck them on the balcony's floor, covering each of them with another sheet of the same color as the floor, to conceal them.\nHe would then tie fishing lines to each of these same-color sheets and pull them away one after the other in order to fool Mayama into believing Dekuri was walking in his direction, and speaking to him. Agata left his fingerprints on the sheets as he was certain Mayama would die and everybody would rush to the railing, leaving him time and space enough to retrieve all the sheets and discard them later.\nAgata tries to run away but gets surrounded by the police who were disguised as visitors and high school students. Agata finally confesses to being the serial killer, giving two bumps to his victims just like the tengu does to Kobutori Tale's evil old man who tries to imitate the good Kobutori, just like Nishiki, Ihaya and Mayama stole Dekuri's work and pretended his name would feature in the movie's credits when it eventually was not the case.\nAgata asked them for an explanation, saying Dekuri cried unceasingly, and the three men replied they were so happy their plan had worked perfectly, thus implying they wanted to humiliate their depressed friend and never had the intention to put his name in the movie. But Keiko and Mayama stop him and say that the staff had modified some very important typology spaces in the credits, preventing the name \"Michio Dekuri\" from appearing.\nAs in reality the name was supposed to appear across the five people's vertical names, which is why everyone changed their names and spaces. Dekuri's name was supposed to appear at the same time. They originally planned to put his name as the original author of the story but the producers didn't want to because they couldn't pay for another staff member, so they decided to put his name that way. Agata wasn't told about it as their friends wanted Dekuri and him to discover the surprise while watching the movie together, as they were really close friends. Agata shocked and appalled by his actions breaks down in regret for what he had done to his friends.\nAfter the case is solved, Ran talks about a nice place that Okita had told her about and as Sonoko and Masumi start going ahead, Shinichi holds Ran back and asks her how she feels about him. Shinichi mentions Ran's meeting with Okita the previous and wonders if she has forgotten about his confession in London. In response, Ran pulls him closer by grabbing his tie and kisses him on the cheek.\nShinichi moves to kiss Ran on the lips, but the antidote begins to wear off, and he flees. Masumi gives chase, only to run into Heiji. She realizes that the rucksack Heiji is wearing has the shrunken Shinichi inside it, but doesn't directly confront the two about it. Shinichi and Heiji therefore understand that Masumi knows about Shinichi being Conan.\nA teacher of Teitan High School tells students Shinichi has to leave due to an emergency, and tells them not to say a word about Shinichi's coming and presence to Kyoto, as specially asked for by Shinichi himself.\nRan tells Sonoko she actually took Okita aside to give him back his talisman he had dropped during the Kendo Case. She apologised to Okita because she and her father unwittingly opened the talisman, and found a piece of wood and a picture showing Moroha Kurogane, Okita's secret love and a skilled high school kendo practitioner as well. Okita says Moroha is actually his rival Yaiba Kurogane's little sister, and he will date Moroha as soon as he defeats Yaiba at kendo. Okita accepts Ran's excuse but just asks her not to tell a word of this to Momiji, probably because he loves her as well.\nAs Shinichi and Ran exchange texts about what the kiss means for their relationship, both of them being mutually satisfied with each other's declaration, Masumi speaks with Mary. Mary orders her to obtain the \"medicine\" that will return her to her true age, so that they can stop running, and counter-attack.\nHeiji gives Conan a motorbike ride back to Tokyo, and Ran texts Shinichi to ask him if they're officially dating each other now. Conan thinks about the last antidote Haibara gave him but which he couldn't take as the timing made it impossible: the class was leaving Kyoto and Shinichi still needed to wait for another 8 hours before taking it... Heiji secretly envies Shinichi who not only \"stole\" his second favourite place in Japan to confess his love to Kazuha, but also as Shinichi is his rival, he now sets the bar high and Heiji has from here on to go further in his relationship with Kazuha as well.\nYukiko and Yusaku are watching the Kyoto Case on TV, in Los Angeles, and are puzzled over the case being broadcasted so much, even worldwide, and hitting the headlines. Yusaku replies it has to do with the victims' and culprit's fame. As Yukiko feels moved to hear the crime motive was Kyoko's boyfriend's death, Yusaku explains he knew about Michio Dekuri's full name as he had seen the movie's poster online and noticed the rearrangement of names and spaces, exactly the same as for the movie's credits, showing the boyfriend's name across his other friends' names, which is why Kyoko/Keiko changed her name. He then comments on the fact Dekuri would have probably not killed himself if he had seen the poster earlier. He also talks about a more burning issue: has Shinichi been spotted by media or else while he was solving the case since Shinichi is considered dead for most people, including the Black Organization.\n",
