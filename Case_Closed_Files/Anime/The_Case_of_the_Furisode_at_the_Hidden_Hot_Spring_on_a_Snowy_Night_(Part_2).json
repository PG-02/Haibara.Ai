    "Situation": "Five years ago, in the middle of a huge campus belonging to a college, a beautiful but despaired young woman climbs to a tower. After taking a good look at her surroundings, she sadly closes her eyes and throws herself off. The perspective switches to students who witness the girl's suicide, then to a flock of doves that fly away.\n\nKogoro, Ran, and Conan take a trip to a hot springs lodge, the Kotoya Inn (琴屋旅館), in village deep in the mountains of Yonezawa, Yamagata Prefecture, to cure Kogoro's shoulder pain. Kotoya Inn is reputed for its host springs that can cure stiff shoulders. They find a group of people who work in the entertainement industry and are getting ready to film a TV special about Japanese young women who have reached fame and stardom. The members of the crew are: the editor Yoriko Yasuda from Daigakukan Publishing[N 1], the TV producer Kyoichi Bando, the novelist Eri Akechi, whom Kogoro is a fan of, the top model Asuka Shibasaki, the famous oil painter Ema Anzai, and the singer/songwriter Harumi Fukatsu, whom Ran admires. Yasuda and Bando recognize Kogoro, so they approach him and explain the project to him, Ran and Conan. Asuka and Ema make bad impressions due to their snide behavior. On the other hand, Harumi, whom Asuka and Ema badmouth in front of everyone, calling her a \"one hit wonder\" among other insults, and Eri, are more modest and quiet. Harumi, Asuka and Ema all graduated from Odo University (王道大学), just like Yasuda, which is what prompted her to make a show about the three girls' success.\nWhen Kogoro, Ran, and Conan are shown their room, Ran remarks on how many beautiful kimonos are hung around as part of the decoration. She asks why, and the owner explains that it is to pay their respects to a local Shinto deity named the \"Furisode-sama\" (振袖様), the kimono goddess whose shrine is located nearby. They later take a walk with Eri Akechi, and as they take a peek to a miniature shrine to the kimono goddess, she tells them about something she learned about: the Goddess's darker side, the Goddess of Vengeance.\nAccording to the legend, centuries ago, a sweet village girl named Ohana (お花) lived nearby, and after saving a very rich feudal lord's life, she was given a whole chest full of beautiful and incredibly pricy kimonos as a reward. However, the greedy daughters of the local leader wanted Ohana's wardrobe, so they falsely accused Ohana of being a criminal and managed to get the poor woman executed, who was crucified and impaled crying out. The two girls seized Ohana's gorgeous wardrobe just as they wanted, but as they were putting such lovely clothes on, in darkness, the spirit of Ohana, a demon with cold breeze, had taken her revenge killing them both: the youngest sister was found suffocated to death under the kimonos, while the eldest was found drowned in a pond under many obis (kimono sashes).\nEri finishes the story via telling that, to placate Ohana's vengeful spirit, the villagers built a Shinto shrine and many smaller temples in her memory, and named her as their protector. Ran remarks on how much Eri knows about the legend, and Eri explains that she often comes into this lodge to do research for her novels.\nThe group encounters Harumi at the temple, standing in front of the 500-year-old \"Kimono Cherry Tree\", which looks like a kimono when it is in bloom. She says that an old friend from her college who was very fond of the supernatural told her about said cherry tree. As Kogoro scolds Conan for running around, Eri adds that the Kimono Goddess is also a vindicative deity: according to the legend, if someone clad in kimono comes to the shrine at midnight, they can ask the Goddess to punish someone or sponsor a punishment, and that people shall leave paper dolls as an offer to her.\nEri opens a small wooden box containing the paper dolls, and she and Kogoro notice how there are two new dolls. Eri remarks that this means someone wants vengeance against two persons, which worries Conan.\nThe group returns to the inn, and Kogoro tells a rather frightened Ran to not believe such legends. Conan notices that there is a small building within the inn's grounds, and Eri says it is likely another shrine to the Kimono Goddess. Ran is still very worried and asks Kogoro to check it out to see if there are more dolls inside, but neither he nor Conan find anything. They decide to relax and enjoy the famous springs, settled in a gorgeous mountain scenery.\nLater that night, the TV crew and the Mouri Family are relaxing and drinking, while enjoying a succulent crab casserole dish. Ema asks Eri to make a good character based on her despite how she still does not have the basics for the script planned, and Asuka makes snarky and hurtful comments when Bando asks Harumi to write and sing the opening song. Meanwhile Kogoro is very drunk off sake in the nearby suite, asking a fastidiated Ran to fill up his cup. Soon, Harumi shows up and tells the two that she has something to ask from Kogoro. She seems to be very worried and sad, and Conan wonders what this is about.\nHarumi starts speaking about her college times. Five years ago, there was a very popular drug in the college circles frequented by Harumi and her best friend, a girl named Sakurako Suzuka. Several drug doses were found in Sakurako's locker, and after being unable to prove her innocence, Sakurako fell into deep depression and committed suicide by jumping off the main campus's building, as seen in the initial flashback. Sakurako was the college student who told Harumi about the Kimono Goddess, and Harumi believes that she was actually innocent from the drug-selling charges.\nWhen done with her story, Harumi asks Kogoro to re-open the case. Kogoro says he is not sure if he can actually do it, since the case happened five years ago already. Harumi adds more info: there were other suspects among the students, but they were not investigated due to being from rich families, and they were actually Asuka Shibasaki, daughter of a politician, and Ema Anzai, eldest child of the Anzai Global Enteprises's president, who both disliked Sakurako because she was straightforward, naive and a strong believer in justice. Harumi again asks Kogoro to investigate, and he accepts to do so. Ran remarks on how fond Harumi was of Sakurako. She explains that they bonded over both being orphans (Harumi was raised by her uncle and aunt), and became very close.\nDuring the night, Asuka skips out of the crew's suite and goes out to take a soak. Ema finds a note on a desk and frowns.\nKogoro, Ran, Conan, and Harumi go to have a soak, and find Eri getting out of the springs. She declines a drinking invitation from Kogoro since she says she has a heavy workload, so the group goes into the springs without her. To Ran's disappointment, the women's side of springs are reserved for an hour, from 22:00 to 23:00, so she and Harumi decide to go play ping-pong while Conan and Kogoro bathe. They later finish their bath and see the girls playing. Conan sees that Harumi is wearing glasses, and she says she normally wears contacts except for when she is in a bath.\nAt 23:30, Ran and Harumi stop playing and go check on the womens's side, which is still closed. They find a small doll on the floor, which was not there when they got in, and it is wearing a small demon mask. A worried Conan then asks Kogoro to open the door by force, and he does so but the door falls on him. Conan runs in and finds Asuka inside the spring, surrounded by luxurious obi sashes. Kogoro also gets inside the spring and quickly checks on her: she is dead, and her cause of death is a stab wound in the chest.\n\nConan remembers the legend and rushes to the shrine, mentally recalling the legend of the Goddess. They find Bando, Yasuda and Eri in the lounge, and the girls tell them about Asuka's murder. Conan asks about Ema and Yasuda says she left a while ago. He opens the sliding door and finds footsteps in the snow, which lead to the small shrine in the inn grounds. Kogoro and Conan walk in the snow to the mini-shrine, whose door is also closed: when they open it, they find Ema dead in the middle of a pile of kimonos, also stabbed to death and with a vengeance doll on her pierced chest.\n\nConan again thinks of the myth of the Kimono Goddess, as he can only see Ema's footsteps aside of Kogoro's and his own, which means this is an impossible crime due to the culprit's missing footsteps.\nA local officer named Ogura is sent to help Kogoro investigate, saying that the prefectural police cannot come until the next morning due to the snow. Kogoro asks the landlady to bring some towels and then tells the TV crew to stay put; he and Ogura place towels over Ema's footsteps, while Conan takes pictures and checks on the surroundings of the main building. As he takes pictures of the footprints in the snow, he realizes something and lifts the towels.\nKogoro, Conan, and Ogura go meet up with Eri, Yasuda, and Bando. He asks Yasuda what Ema was doing in the lounge around 22:30 and if she saw somebody else, but she denies it. Kogoro explains the deal with Ema's footsteps being the only ones on the path to the sub-shrine, adding that they could not find any murder weapon; he then mentions that Asuka was found dead in the bath, but that one was connected to the games room and thus someone should have seen something odd, but his group did not see anybody. Bando asks if the killer could have used the mountain path, but Kogoro says he checked around and there was no cliff in the surroundings. Also, he and Omura found a taser and a dagger in the springs: this means that the killer first tasered Asuka to stun her, and then stabbed her, but the dagger had some odd markings, and apparently was a sacred weapon donated alongside the shrine. Not only that, but they also found a headscarf that Ema wore in the bath, and it was stained with blood. This means: both women were stabbed with the same sacred dagger, Ema died before Asuka did, and Ema died around 22:30 with Asuka perishing shortly afterwards.\nBando, Yasuda, and Eri speculate about the lack of footsteps, and then Harumi openly states that it was all due to the Kimono Goddess's curse. As she explains the deal with the two dolls in the shrine, Conan thinks that curses are not possible, wondering what trick could have been used in the double murder.\nThe next morning, Inspector Minoru Masaki from the Yamagata Prefectural Police, along with his assistant Tamura, arrive. He confirms that the murder weapon in both murders was the holy knife. It is also discovered that Ema is missing an earring. This is a very expensive earring from a special brand. Harumi admits to having the same ones, but she does not wear them so as not to upset Ema.\nEveryone present gives their alibi at the time of the crime. Eri was at the springs before the crime and then went to her room. She ran into Conan and the others. Yoriko confirms that Eri came from the spring and Asuka went there after her. Meanwhile, Yoriko sat in the lobby sorting out interviews. Masaki asks about any special incidents while bathing and Conan interjects that they heard a loud splashing noise coming from the ladies' spring next door. Ran and Harumi were in the break room at the time. Harumi was only gone for ten minutes to get her glasses. Conan also wants to know why Ema went to the shrine in the first place. Masaki shows a note that claims to be from Kyoichi. However, he denies having written it. In addition, he has no alibi because he only came to the lobby where Yoriko was after the time of the crime. Harumi, on the other hand, is the only one who has a motive.\nA little later, a report comes from the forensics department, who found no fingerprints on any of the evidence. In the evening, Conan sits with Ran at a bar where he watches a television report about a sled race. He has a rough idea of ​​how the crime could have happened and looks at the crime scene again. Back at the inn, he discovers Kyoichi's business card, but a second later Ran scolds him because his socks are wet. He realizes that the footprints outside the shrine are way too shallow if someone actually walked over them. Conan now knows the perpetrator, but does not yet understand his motive. As he continues to look around the inn, Conan discovers a slit in the ceiling at the entrance to the spring. He calls detective Takagi in Kogoro's voice and asks for more information. He also asks officer Ogura for a favor on behalf of Kogoro.\n",

    "Resolution": "Finally found out, Eri Akechi, whose real name is Chieri Ake (the kanji 明智 恵理 becomes 明 智恵理) confesses and explains what led her to commit the unthinkable. She and the dead Sakurako were sisters, whose parents died in a fire. While the Suzuka family only adopted Sakurako, the sisters managed to keep close contact during their childhood/teenage/young adult years until Eri, now a promising writer, moved to Boston for some time: the kind but frail Sakurako was framed for drug trade and committed suicide during these days, and Eri only found out a year later.\nDeeply hurt by Sakurako's death and how her younger sister never told her that she was in deep trouble, Eri made more research on the circumstances surrounding her suicide, finding out about her devotion to the Kimono Goddess and about Ema and Asuka. She then contacted her university classmate Yoriko to arrange a meeting between them, and then she killed the two as punishment for causing the death of her sister, using the Kimono Goddess legend not just to cover her tracks, but as a symbol of her revenge. Like the selfish girls from the legend who got Ohana executed to steal her kimonos and later were killed by her spirit, Asuka and Ema lost their lives for having used Sakurako as a scapegoat for their own crimes.\nConan-through-Kogoro bitterly asks Eri if she believes that the kind Sakurako would have been satisfied with her revenge. He then adds that Sakurako's best friend Harumi was mourning for her death too but Eri did not take her feelings into consideration, when in fact Sakurako would have loved it if they had become friends. In front of a sobbing Harumi, Eri falls to her knees and breaks down in tears.\n",
    "Analysis": "The plot of the story is one of Koujin Ochi's strengths, known notably for A Cursed Mask Coldly Laughs and The Séance's Double Locked Room Mystery Case, and although the identity of the culprit can be deduced quickly by the viewers, and evidence pointing to the culprit remains flimsy, the impossible crime aspect of the case cannot be refuted. Ochi manages here to bring two impossible situations together, the footprints in the snow, as well as Asuka's murder with Ran and Harumi in the next room, using a single theme, which is also strongly present in the story and the backstory leading to the main plot[3].\nAn other key aspect that was well incorporated in the case was the relationship between the main cast, which is often looked over[4]. The notable scene where Ran scolds Kogoro for drinking shows well the dynamics between both characters. Furthermore, a serious Ran playing ping-pong, while a relaxed Conan in the bath, which are rare sights even in the main manga, were added by the production team.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is Koujin Ochi's last case written under his real name, Hirohito Ochi.\n- The producer of the Detective Conan anime, Michihiko Suwa, disclosed in an interview with Minami Takayama, that the original author, Gosho Aoyama thinks the trick used in this case is fairly interesting.\n- On the television in the hotel bar, the singer Rina Aiuchi sings START.\n- The Kotoya Inn's van is a 2000 dark blue Toyota HiAce Commuter.\n- The writers of this episode just came up with Eri Akechi's name by just using Eri Kisaki's given name and then Kogoro Akechi's family name. This is why Eri makes a comment about being embarrassed when she's called \"Akechi-sensei\" since it sounds like people are referring to the fictional detective.\n- The legend used to depict the series of murders is modeled from the Hannya legend and Yakumo Koizumi's Furisode.\n- The vehicle that Kogoro, Ran, and Conan are riding in the first scene has a license plate of 38-66.\n",
