    "Situation": "Kogoro is hired by Misaki Yanai, an old friend of Ran and Sonoko from middle school, to re-investigate the suicide of her older sister, Nagisa. Misaki believes that her sister didn't commit suicide but was murdered instead. Kogoro phones Inspector Megure and is told that the case was indeed a suicide due to the credible witness testimonies and forensic confirmation, causing Misaki to burst into tears. With Conan's suggestion, Kogoro allows her to retell what actually occurred.\n\nAs Nagisa had planned to marry Shibagaki after she finished high school, she has no reason to commit suicide. They later arrange for Takagi to share them the crime scene's photo while Kogoro brings up an interesting topic about the case: none of the three suspects possess a motive to murder Nagisa nor benefit from her death. The group also learns that Shibagaki was two-timing Nagisa and Kodama, causing the latter to broke up with him when she learned the truth. Still not satisfied, Conan, Ran, Sonoko, and Misaki head to Yanai High School to recreate the crime scene with Sonoko acting as the victim. They discovers that the stool Nagisa supposedly used to hang herself contradicts the height and position where Misaki saw her from the courtyard.\n",
