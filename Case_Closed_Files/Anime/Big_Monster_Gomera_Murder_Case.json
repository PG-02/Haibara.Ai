And though Lester was sent to prison, he continues writing new Gomera movies under \"A. Gomer\".\n",

    "Trivia": "- \"Gomera\" is a reference to Toho's Gozilla Kaiju franchise. The fairy that calms Gomera's rage is a reference to the twin fairies from Toho's Mothra series, in which Mothra becomes enraged whenever the fairies are threatened and only the fairies can calm Mothra.\n- Another kaiju that possibly used as model is Gamera which has similar name and long lower canine. The name \"Gomera\" comes from replacing the \"Ga\" katakana in \"Gamera\" (ガ) with the \"Go\" katakana from Godzilla's Japanese name \"Gojira\" (ゴ) and both monster's names end in \"ra\" (ラ), thus making \"Gomera\" a portmanteau.\n- This is the first case Conan solves using Agasa.\nThe reason given (at least in the English Dub) for why Conan didn't knock anyone out to solve the case is due to him not having his Wristwatch Stun-Gun with him, therefore prompting him to ask Agasa to lipsync while using the voice-changing bow tie to solve the case.\n- The reason given (at least in the English Dub) for why Conan didn't knock anyone out to solve the case is due to him not having his Wristwatch Stun-Gun with him, therefore prompting him to ask Agasa to lipsync while using the voice-changing bow tie to solve the case.\n- The trick utilised in this case pays tribute to Death on the Nile, a novel written by Agatha Christie.\n- The reason given (at least in the English Dub) for why Conan didn't knock anyone out to solve the case is due to him not having his Wristwatch Stun-Gun with him, therefore prompting him to ask Agasa to lipsync while using the voice-changing bow tie to solve the case.\n"
