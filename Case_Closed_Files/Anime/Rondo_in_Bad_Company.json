Chiba later suspects the victim's middle school teacher, Kokichi Minamide. Chiba discovers that Minamide had tried to reform those three victim's behavior during middle school, but his efforts never paid off. Chiba deduced that Minamide decide to kill them after he heard that they stole 30 million yen.\nIn the end, Minamide is confirmed to have an alibi. They continue to search the suspicious man. Meanwhile, Conan ask Mamoru more about the suspicious man. He later found the suspicious man in another apartment building.\n",
