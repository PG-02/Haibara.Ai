    "Situation": "Professor Agasa, Haibara, Conan, Ayumi, Mitsuhiko, and Genta went camping. While they're camping, they find a lantern in a pond with some writing inside. They show the stone lantern to Conan who determines that it is a code to finding a large diamond. The lantern is also hiding another secret, a dead body at the bottom of the pond.\n\nAfter searching the body they find out that he was a treasure hunter who was strangled to death by another person looking for the treasure. They also find a tear-shaped stone with the kanji \"inflammation\" written on it and a notebook. The notebook suggests that he was murdered by his partner and that Kaitou Kid is also seeking the treasure. Professor Agasa goes back to camp to call the police.\nConan, Haibara, and the kids decide to enter the house, which belonged to Kichiemon, a puppet maker and architect of the riddle. The house is filled with all kinds of booby-traps, which Genta almost falls victim to until another treasure hunter saves him from a pit of spikes. As they continue to search the house, they meet another treasure hunter and end up falling down a trap door into the basement. Luckily they are saved by Conan's supersized soccer ball. In the basement they find Kichiemon's grave, a bunch of human remains, and an old lady. The first treasure hunter reveals grudgingly that he found the mirror artifact, and Conan reveals the tear-shaped stone. They continue looking for the sword, which is the last piece of the puzzle.\nThe old lady nearly gets chopped up by four swinging blades when she steps on a trap. Conan realizes that if one stands in the right spot the blades will not harm you and that one of the blades actually has a handle allowing him to swing over towards the sword. The sword contains the last clue, which leads everyone back to the pond.\n",
