    "Situation": "Ran and Conan accompany Kogoro to Shiki Island, a very superstitious island, where many of the residents believe in local legends. Kogoro was invited here to make a speech about a ghost ship that had been lost at sea seven years before. Kogoro arrives on stage completely drunk. A miniature bomb explodes, nearly killing him.\n\nConan realizes that the supposed ghost and ghost ship at the shrine in the pirate's cave are being manipulated by someone on the ship.\n\nAttacked at night, Kogoro flees, finding the lighthouse care-taker with a bloody sword protruding from his neck. The townspeople believe Kogoro is responsible, but he insists on his innocence.\n\n\n\nConan proves that Kogoro did not kill the caretaker. Next, Conan enters the cave to show that the sounds were from the wind in the tunnels. But before he can Suzu finds him and threatens to tell, unless conan kisses her that is. So after a quick peck on the cheek they both head into the cave. Conan finds a staircase which breaks away to reveal another dead man and the killer. Conan deduces that the ghost ship was stuck in this part of the cave for seven years due to a cave-in. Conan finds the gold hidden in the bricks of the staircase covered in moss. Another cave-in occurs, forcing Conan and the killer to leave. The gold is sealed inside the cave.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (gunshot - injured)\n- 53 years old\n- Shiki Island Town Hall assistant official\n- 50 years old\n- Shiki Island mayor\n- 7 years old\n- Mikami's daughter\n- Victim (gunshot)\n- 44 years old\n- Tohto Travel Agency, Sales\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- 42 years old\n- Lighthouse staff\n",
    "Resolution": "\nConan deduces the gunshot wound he received from Uehara was in fact self-inflicted, the evidence is his scorched skin that had been scorched, and that there was a gunpowder burn, indicating indirect close range fire. For Uehara the gunshot was on the wrong side of his head, including the gun that placed in the wrong hand. Shortly after, Conan after distracting Kinoshita kicks one of the bricks on the floor knocking him out. As the same time revealing the \"bricks\" were actually the gold along, as the gold had been covered in moss due to it being hidden in the cave for so long.\n",

    "Anime": "- The names of the characters and places in the Funimation Dub are:\n- Goro Kinoshita - Edmund Hanratty\n- Takeo Mikami - Chief Mikami\n- Yasuo Uehara - Rex Lager\n- Kouji Hamada - Hank Hamada\n- Ryuujinmaru - Ryumaru\n- Water Army Reference Hall - Museum of Nautical History\n- In the Venus Arabic Dub, Since they remove anything about alcohol, Instead of saying that Kogoro got drunk on \"juice\". They opted to say that he gets dizzy whenever he smells gasoline making it a plot point in which made Conan figure out the exploding ball.\n- The backing track and vocals and lyrics for Kimi ga Ireba are changed, likely due to copyright issues. This would also be the case in The Time-Bombed Skyscraper and The Crab and Whale Kidnapping Case, though in The Fourteenth Target, the original backing track is used, with the English dub lyrics.\n",
