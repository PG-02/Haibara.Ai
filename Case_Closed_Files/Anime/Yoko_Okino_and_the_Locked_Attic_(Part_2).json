Conan tells her that it might be because Yoko is coming there as his client.\nYoko had come across a murder case while traveling to a villa in Karuizawa.\n\nKogoro ends up with the stomach problems and head towards the toilet. Meanwhile, Wakita delivers the sushi and overhears the case from outside and shows interest of the case. Yoko also shows them the group photo of the four who were present with her that day. She mentions the past the brothers shared about playing card games in the attic, hiding from their strict parents. And also that Nukiyasu called his brother Fuugo Ace, despite him not being a pitcher in the past while Fuggo called Heijima the real Ace. She shows a photo of Hejima's sister, wearing long sleeves dress and sunglasses, who also went missing two years ago.\nYoko also mention one odd thing that Hejima said about the number of pine trees being less. In the toilet, Kogoro prepares a coded message to ask for tissue paper and sends it to Conan, who along with Wakita see through the code immediately. From this coded message, Conan and Wakita also solve the case.\n- 39 years old\n- TV producer\n- Victim (blood loss)\n- 46 years old\n- Baba family eldest son\n- 44 years old\n- Baba family second son\n- 43 years old\n- Fuugo's wife\n- Missing person\n- Wanya's older sister\n- Nukiyasu's wife\n",
    "Resolution": "Conan explains how to decode Nukiyasu Baba’s playing cards message. If the card was a heart and was the number 1, it made a reference to the first letter of the english word for the card, \"HEART\", in this case \"H\". If using this decoding, the code finally It says \"Help, I am in the attic. Himi is the culprit\" Nukiyasu was responsible for his wife’s disappearance two years ago. Two years ago, Nukiyasu Baba had killed his wife Houka Baba by domestic violence. Himi killed him to take revenge for killing her friend. Nukiyasu’s coded message was understood by Fuggo, but he decided to play along to protect his wife and avenge her best friend’s death.\n\n",
