    "Situation": "On a rainy night at the Mouri Detective Agency, Detective Chiba arrives and begs Kogoro for help. He wants Kogoro to help him to find a woman that he believes is in danger.\nChiba swiftly explains that recently, he's been seeing a woman at the Ikitsuke Café. The woman named Mio Ashida said she felt like something dangerous will occur. She gave him threatening letters she had received from someone who had recently been released from prison. When questioned, it was revealed that they had been coming for nearly a year and that she had changed jobs and moved because she was afraid of them stalking her. However, recently, she felt she was being watched, thus prompting her to tell Chiba. He had said that if she saw the person, or anyone suspicious, she must tell him immediately. However, when Chiba went to the restroom, Mio left. Concerned, Chiba questioned the owner who said the customer left, and seemed upset or afraid. As Chiba went to follow her, he grabbed an umbrella and realized that he had hers, meaning that in her rush, she had grabbed his.\nWhen Chiba was about to cross the street, a red car came and Chiba quickly got out of the way. He saw a suspicious person wearing a hat and sunglasses in the driver's seat. Chiba felt that it wasn't careless driving, but rather an attempt on his life, and that the driver mistook him for the woman due to having her umbrella. Since Chiba did not get her address before she left, he was not able to find her right away, and due to no evidence, he was unable to do it through the police headquarters, which is why Chiba came to Mouri Detective Agency for help. Since she came to the cafe often, Conan proposed the idea of searching nearby areas, as she likely lived near by.\nSo now, Conan, Ran, Kogoro, and Detective Chiba went all around the places to search for Mio. Meanwhile at an apartment, a student named Takuya Murakami is getting annoyed by someone else on the second floor due to them playing the TV at a high volume. Suddenly, Murakami heard a loud thump from above and a scream from a woman.\nDetective Chiba receives a call while searching for Mio. The call was that a young woman was involved in a murder case at a nearby apartment. When Chiba, Kogoro, Ran, and Conan went to the apartment, they found a red car which was the one that almost ran over Chiba. They went inside and went to the second floor of the apartment. Inspector Megure and Detective Takagi are also there. It seems they found the dead body.\n\nIn the room, a man was on the floor, dead from blunt force trauma to the head. Beside him was the hat and sunglasses Chiba saw on the driver that nearly ran him over, and on the other side of the room, was the woman, Mio. At first relieved to find her alive, Takagi said that she's the perpetrator, much to Chiba's horror. Both groups share their story, with Takagi finally explaining what happened.\nThe incident occurred forty minutes ago, at 9:30 PM. Murakami that lives below said that he heard the commotion, so he came to check. He discovered the dead body and Mio, who was next to the corpse. Murakami then called the police. The victim was a man named Yoshizumi Karashima and was released from prison three days ago, after being kept there for a year due to a traffic accident. During the incident, there was a drunk driver that broke the guard rail and fell into the lake. Of the two, the driver died, while the other only received light injuries, but were sentenced one year of prison for allowing a drunk to drive. The driver had been Mio's older brother, and the deceased, Karashima, was the other one in the car.\nMio thinks it's a lie that her brother was driving due to a past incident her brother had with drunk driving that made him swear to not ever go behind the wheel again. She believes that the person that was really driving was Karashima. The driver that died was indeed her older brother, Toshiaki Ashida. Karashima said that her brother was the one driving, but she could not believe his story. She filed serveral objections to the court, but all of them were rejected. Chiba has no doubt that it must be revenge, so he showed the letters written by Karashima when he was in prison. All of the letters said that he would meet Mio after being released from prison.\nMio moved to the apartment where she won't be stalked by Karashima. In fact, the move was so recent that all the stuff in the her apartment hasn't even been used yet. She even stated that she only came to sleep due to how scared she was. When she came home, the lights were on, and the door was unlocked. She didn't think anybody would be inside. When she opened the door, Karashima suddenly grabbed her and went about to stab her, with Mio resisting, using her umbrella as a means of defense. They moved to the living room while struggling and Mio pushed him to the wall where the vase hit on his head. Conan sees the injury on the back of Karashima's head, but also noticeed that there's another injury above his nose. Chiba thinks he must've got hurt while struggling as there was blood on the corner of the TV desk.\nIt seemed like a clear case of self-defense, but Conan was starting to find holes in the story he heard. He had found the umbrella container that still has a little puddle of water in it, Karashima's shoes were wet as well. After confirming that the rain started at seven that evening, Conan went downstairs of the apartment to visit Murakami for questioning. The witness informed Conan that he heard the tv around six, and that it turned off at about nine thirty, before being swiftly followed by the thud and screams. Afterwards, Conan went outside to check the red car and he figured out the truth behind the case.\n",
    "People": "- 23 years old\n- Office worker\n- Chiba's friend\n- 20 years old\n- Student who failed entrance exam\n- Victim (beaten)\n- 28 years old\n- Unemployed\n- Deceased (car-accident)\n- 28 years old\n- Mio's older brother\n- Deceased (illness)\n- Toshiaki and Mio's father\n- Deceased (illness)\n- Toshiaki and Mio's mother\n",
    "Resolution": "Conan reveals that this was no self-defense, but a well planned murder. The umbrella container has puddle of water in it. Their umbrellas are outside to preserve the crime scene. That means, there's only one umbrella in the apartment. The umbrella she mistakenly took at the café is Detective Chiba's umbrella. The umbrella that was inside the umbrella container is the one. If that's true, the part being attacked right when she entered by Karashima will be a contradiction. Mio didn't have the time to put the umbrella inside the container. There's another contradiction, even though he walked to the apartment from the car, his clothes are not wet at all. He could have used the umbrella but they weren't any other umbrellas. In other words, Karashima got in the apartment before it started raining which is before 7. The shoes are wet but Karashima's socks and pants are not wet at all. There's one more contradiction, the car's driver seat. For a large person to be driving, the seat was too close to the handle. These are all situational proofs, but there is only thing that can bring the case to light. This was no self-defense, but a planned murder by the culprit, Mio Ashida. This was all set up by Mio from the beginning. Mio first marked the doorknob to make it looked like it was picked. She called Karashima on the phone saying, \"the door is unlocked, so wait inside.\" Next, she showed Detective Chiba the letters that were from Karashima. She portrayed herself as if she was afraid. Then she purposely took Chiba's umbrella and left the café. She used her car to try to hit Chiba. She made Chiba think that she was targeted. During that time, Karashima went to her home before it rained. While waiting for her, he was watching tv. He couldn't use the remote so used the tv. Mio came home around 9:30. Karashima crawled towards the tv on his knees and turns it off. That's when he get knocked down with a vase from behind. He fell forward, hitting his nose on the table. That's the first noise Murakami heard. After that, Mio made Karashima hold the knife. The hat and sunglasses Chiba saw was put near Karashima to make it look like that Karashima was the stalker. The scream Murakami heard was all acting from Mio. She chose the apartment because noise can be easily heard through the walls. Murakami also heard other noises during the murder. Chiba said that Karashima threatening her is a fact. The anger from the court and the letter is proof, but about the letter, especially the letter that started up again. \"After finishing my sentence, I want to meet you and tell you the truth.\" That is why he kept on sending those letters. It's probably about the accident from one year ago. He might have wanted to confess what he had done to Mio. Conan wondered why the letters stopped for awhile so he had Takagi check. Takagi confirms that before the letters stopped, Karashima had a serious illness during prison. The doctor said he had six months left to live. After leaving prison, he hasn't visited a hospital that the doctor advised him to visit. Most likely, he was looking for Mio, who changed jobs and moved. Then he really want to confess his sins. Mio thinks it's a lie and she doesn't believe it. She still doesn't forgive him at all. Her brother died, she was dumped, and her father got fired and died in the hospital from being ill. Her mother died soon after. Nobody saved her. Nobody believed her brother was innocent. That's why she chose revenge on Karashima. Then, as a real proof, after finding out what it is, she will figure out what she had done was meaningless. Even though, there doesn't exist a meaningful murder. Conan will show the demonstration. Mio will act as Karashima and Chiba will act as Mio. When the tv is turn on, Chiba will act as if he is going to attack by raising his hands like he's holding something and Mio will crawl towards the tv on her knees and turn it off. When she turned it off, there is a tv reflection of Chiba behind her. That's when Karashima saw Mio. But he did not run. The only thing Conan think of is that he chose death. He was repenting from deep within his heart. Now Mio is arrested for murder.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The car driven by the culprit is a 2007 Redondo Red Pearl Honda Inspire [CP]. The license plate number is 新宿 334, な 12-28 (Shinjuku 334, Na 12-28).\n"
