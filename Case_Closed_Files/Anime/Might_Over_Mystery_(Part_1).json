    "Situation": "Eri invites Ran and Conan to dinner along with her friend Yuko Arisawa. Yuko tells Eri that someone is stalking her husband and wants her to help. Her husband, Shiro Arisawa, calls her and reveals he is currently attending a wake and will be home in two hours. While eating at a hotel restaurant, Yuko tells them she strongly admires Hajime Kajimoto, her former judo senpai and the current coach of Japan's judo team. After dinner, Yuko takes them all to her house and there, they find Shiro strangled with his necktie.\n\nYuko's strange behavior causes both Conan and Eri to suspect her for murdering her husband, but they are unable to disprove her alibi.\nRan decides to phone her father to ask for help, but he is busy playing mahjong. Eri tells Conan and Ran that in the past Kogoro would always played a recording of the police siren and say he is busy solving a case when he was actually at a bar drinking.\n",
    "People": "- 37 years old\n- Judo martial artist\n- Eri's client\n- Victim (strangled)\n- 37 years old\n- Yuko's husband\n- Haido Shoji businessman\n- Hajime's previous employee\n- Yuko's former judo senpai\n- Current coach of Japan's judo team\n- Hajime's wife\n- Hajime's son\n- Restaurant parking security guard\n- Shiro's friend\n- Shiro's friend\n",
    "Resolution": "Yuko confesses and reveals that she not only admired Hajime, but was in love with him. However, Hajime was already married when she met him and she respected that, doing her best to let go of her unrequited love and later marrying Shiro. Later, Shiro had an affair with Hajime's wife and she was angered that her husband would destroy a perfect family, so she murdered him. Eri reveals that Shiro's affair was not well hidden and deduces Shiro wanted Yuko to find out about the affair as he was envious about her admiration of Hajime, probably because he was so jealous of Yuko's affection for Hajime that he wanted to punish her for, in his mind, \"not loving him enough\".\n",
