    "Situation": "Kogoro is invited to Black Bunny's Club by his client. Amuro mentions Shinichi's involvement in the previous case to Ran, who says that they were instructed not to talk about the case by their teacher. To avoid any further discussion on Shinichi, Conan invites Amuro to the club. Kogoro agrees.\n\n\nNine hours later, after leaving for the Black Bunny's Club and encountering a murder there, Amuro and Akai come face to face, their guns pointed at each-other.\nDuring the case, Amuro has a sudden flashback to Elena Miyano treating his wounds and telling him goodbye. He wonders why he suddenly remembered her.\nBy process of elimination showed by Conan, through presenting possible situations that the suspects might use before and/or on the time of the murder, they were able to single out the culprit.\n",
    "People": "- 50 years old\n- Kogoro's client\n- Real estate magnate\n- 72 years old\n- Morooka's butler\n- Victim (poison - injured)\n- 25 years old\n- Black Bunny's Club worker\n- 28 years old\n- Black Bunny's Club worker\n- Deceased (illness)\n- Morooka's wife\n- Black Bunny's Club's client\n- Morooka's bodyguard\n- Morooka's bodyguard\n- Black Bunny's Club worker\n- Black Bunny's Club worker\n- Black Bunny's Club worker\n- Black Bunny's Club worker\n- Black Bunny's Club worker\n",
    "Resolution": "Yuri Asakura is revealed to be Gunzo Morooka's daughter that he had with a woman with whom he ran away which Fukamichi didn't knew about. Yuri also makes a successful recovery.\nThe real reason Amuro had remembered Elena was because the truth of the case resembled his behavior when he'd injure himself intentionally so he could go to the clinic Elena worked at.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "",
    "Trivia": "- The Black Bunny's Club is modeled after Playboy Clubs.\n- Bottles of Gin and Vodka can be spotted in the background of the bar.\n- Gunzo Morooka and Atsufumi Fukamachi's car is a black 2008 Mercedes-Benz C350 Sport [W204]. The license plate is 新宿 320, ま 23-06 (Shinjuku 320, Ma 23-06).\n- The name of the suspects are derived from the municipal administrative divisions of Japan[1]:\n- Gunzō Morooka (諸岡 郡蔵) is named after districts (郡, gun);\n- Atsufumi Fukamachi (深町 惇史) is named after towns (町, machi);\n- Yuri Asakura (朝倉 有里) is named after villages (2nd level, 里, sato). In the case, she states that her name comes from the lily (百合の花, yuri no hana), hence why her fake nails are blue. She also has the first name of Shōnen Sunday editor Yuri Yoshida (吉田 有里);\n- Sana Murakami (村上 紗菜) is named after villages (1st level, 村, mura). Her name is also Gosho's assistant Ryo Kamishiro (神城 亮)'s real name, with the same kanji (村上 紗菜).\n",
