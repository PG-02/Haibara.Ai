    "Situation": "Ran discovers a receipt for a necklace in Kogoro's wallet and discerns that he is going to give it to Eri as a birthday present. Ran decides to enter a raffle draw to win a luxury hotel trip for her parents and succeeds in winning the tickets. Eri reschedules to meet her client at the hotel upon hearing about the supposed necklace. Her client, Akiho Kokuba, enters Eri's room after getting into a fight with her husband, Takehiko Kokuba, and falls asleep. Eri arranges for Takehiko to retrieve his wife and leaves to eat dinner with her family. She returns to her room, disappointed by Kogoro's behavior and the lack of a present and opens a carbonated drink but is soaked by the can. After showering to wash off the drink, she returns and finds Akiho dead in her room.\n\nConan notices the blood stains suggest the bed was moved, and hypothesis the culprit murdered Akiho, concealed her body under the bed and hid himself, then when Eri went to shower, returns the bed back to its original position and leaves the room. The police investigate the alibis of the three suspects, Akiho's stalker and his mother, and her husband.\nThat night, Conan realizes how the murder was done and who the culprit is. The next day, he drops a hint for Kogoro by spilling ketchup on a food cart which creates an evenly spaced ketchup stain on the floor, miming the victim's blood stain.\n",
