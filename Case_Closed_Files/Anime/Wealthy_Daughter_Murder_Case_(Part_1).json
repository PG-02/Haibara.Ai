    "Resolution": "Ichieda, who was in love with Yaeko, kept his bad feelings to himself until Reika's 24th birthday. After isolating the group in the mansion, he first kidnapped Reika and kept her hostage in one of the bathrooms, then bound and gagged her inside a covered bath tub, getting everything ready so she would slowly drown automatically. The proof of this is Reika disappeared around 10 PM but she wasn't killed until 5 or 6 AM which means that she was left alive for 7 to 8 hours before her death. Second proof is her clothes, they couldn't possibly get that wet, no matter how much she struggled. Third proof is the duct tape and rope marks on the corpse, it is odd that she was restrained with both rope and duct tape when she had already had been restrained with rope. Ichieda switched the faucet with the shower so that he could fill the bath quietly. To prevent somebody finding the corpse in the tub, he burned out the bulbs beforehand to keep people from coming through and using the bathroom. Ichieda checked the bathtub himself and told the others that Reika was not there to fool them. He then created his alibi by staying with Kogoro during the murder. As soon as he could he confronted Nikaido, and when he admitted his share of guilt, Ichieda drowned him outside with his own hands and left his lifeless body there.\nTo throw people off again, Ichieda used the air conditioners and microwave to cause the lights to turn off by themselves. First, he set all the air conditioners to turn on simultaneously at a set time using their remote controls. Then, he set the microwave so that it would turn on at the same time as well. When the time came, the overuse of electricity within the mansion would would suddenly spark and would cause the breaker to overload causing the lights to go out. The proof is that the remote controls were still displaying the time that they were all set to 12:30, which is when the lights went out. Also, at the same time Conan heard the bell of the microwave. The microwaves there operate with dials so they will still work even without electricity. Another piece of evidence is when Conan touched the microwave, it was still warm. Lastly, a little while before the lights went out, Ichieda went into the kitchen with Conan and Kogoro to search for Reika. As they were leaving the kitchen he doubled back and set the timer on the microwave when no one was looking.\nAfter turning off the lights, Ichieda broke a window in the dark and made it look like the killer ran away so that they would give chase. He pretended to get lost in the forest and then went back to the mansion and took the unguarded Ran to the kitchen and tried to drown her. He even drugged her beforehand so that she wouldn't be able to struggle. When he put the pills in, he could have turned the cup, moved the spoon, or done any number of things to identify the cup: all he had to do was avoid it. Also, it didn't matter who took the cup: It was just a coincidence that Ran was the one who took the drugged one. The attack on Ran wasn't intended to be fatal, he only needed a witness to throw suspicions off himself, by making everyone believe that the murderer was an outsider, and give fake evidence that the murderer had killed Reika in the same fashion.\nFew hours later, a still restrained Reika drowned in the tub. Ichieda pulled her lifeless body out of the bathtub and left it next to said tub for everyone to find. The proof that only Ichieda could have committed the murder is the water on his undershirt. All of the suspects in fact have water on their shirts. However, the water on Goujo's sleeve is from when he washed his hands and the water on Mifune's collar is from when he washed his face. On the other hand, Ichieda's arms on his shirt had gotten soaked. This is proof that he took his jacket off first before water got on them. He took off his jacket so that it wouldn't get wet when he committed the murder. His elbows are wet because he rolled his sleeves up to take Reika out of the bathtub.\n\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga version, Reika announces to her father and the guests about her intention to get married to one of the suitors at the party. This scene is removed in the anime.\n- Reika wears a white coat over her dress when she is about to leave the house with her father after the party had ended in the anime.\n- Some of Reika's expressions and mannerisms were changed to be less malevolent, leaning more toward being childish, compared to the manga.\n- In the anime, after Yone put a blanket on Ran who is sleeping on a sofa, she looks at Ran's face and is reminded of her granddaughter Yaeko.\n- In the anime, Ichieda doesn't drink the coffee served by Ran and Yone, as he has previously drugged one of the cups.\n- In the anime, Conan states through Kogoro that Ichieda simply avoided the drugged coffee by not drinking it, compared to the manga in which he speculates that Ichieda must had marked the cup with a spoon or rotating/placing the cup in a recognizable position.\n- In the anime, after Yone is angered by Ichieda's cruel and callous attitude and saddened by Reika's passing she also closes the lifeless Reika's eyes in sign of paying respect to her.\n",
