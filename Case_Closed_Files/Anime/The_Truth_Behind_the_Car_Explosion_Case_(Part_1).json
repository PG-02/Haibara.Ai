    "Situation": "Kogoro reveals that he tutored in his youth, and resolves to meet up with one of his students. However, when they go see her, her car suddenly explodes as her sister drives it out of the driveway.\n\nKogoro is determined to solve the case and find the murderer as soon as possible. At the end, he appears to solve the case, but Conan believes there is a little more to it than the simple explanation he gives.\nWith some prodding by Conan, Kogoro finds the truth of the case himself.\n",

    "Resolution": "- Some time ago, Megumi was suspicious of Kazuo's affair with Hiromi and bought a wiretapping device in Akihabara and secretly installed it in her husband's study. What she discovered however, was far more frightening as Kazuo planned an murder exchange with Hiromasa in order to gain their wives' insurance money, and in Kazuo's case, to go be with Hiromi and financially support her boutique shop. Realizing that her husband had already murdered Hiromasa's wife Sachiko, Megumi decided to use their own plan against them by using it to kill Hiromi and punish the men. With this knowledge in mind, Megumi was very careful to not let her guard down as she knew that Hiromasa was presumably stalking her, thought she never saw him in face directly.\n- On the day of the crime, Megumi told Kazuo that she planned to visit Hiromi at her parents' former house, knowing fully well that the men wouldn't miss this opportunity to kill her, as they had to make sure that the police couldn't trace the crime back to them. Once Megumi left her house, Kazue went outside and used public phone to call Hiromasa about Megumi's whereabouts. Hiromasa then tailed Megumi to her parents' former house, and used the time that she was inside to plant a bomb in her car, which was rigged to explode the moment that Megumi backed the car out of the house's garage. Unbeknownst to him, Megumi was spying on his entire actions through the storeroom's window and saw his face. When it was time to leave, Megumi pretended to not be skilled in backing her car out and asked Hiromi to do it. Hiromi fell for the trick, and thus was killed in the explosion. Once Megumi herself was hospitalized for the injury, she would then provide a sketch of Hiromasa's face, allowing the police to track him and eventually her husband down and arrest them.\n- Megumi's miscalculation was that Kogoro happened to pass by her parents' former house on that day. Though she feared his detective reputation, she decided to go with her plan as that was the last opportunity for her to kill her hated sister.\nAt this point, Megumi then asks Kogoro what crime she would be charged for as she was neither the perpetrator nor the accomplice in the murder, and she only let Hiromi drove in a car that had a possibility of being bombed. Kogoro however, calmly replies that it might be the case normally, except that in this case she let her sister drive in a car that had a high or 100% possibility of being bombed, meaning that she could be charged for first degree murder.\n- The concrete evidence of Megumi knowing that a bomb was planted in her car is that the sketch of Hiromasa doesn't feature a pair of sunglasses: Hiromasa was always careful when stalking Megumi in Nishitama City supermarket \"P & P\" and always wore a pair of sunglasses to conceal his face, and he stated in his testimony that Megumi never saw him prior to the crime. The only time for Megumi to see his face without sunglasses was when she was spying on him at the garage from the storeroom's window, as Hiromasa had to remove it for his own safety prior to installing the bomb.\n",
