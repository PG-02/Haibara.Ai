    "Situation": "Kogoro is invited to a party for the release of a game which stars himself. While there, Conan runs into a man who uses the alias Tequila and learns that he plans to meet with Gin and Vodka. Conan follows Tequila to the bathroom where an explosion occurs and kills the man. Conan investigates the explosion and realizes that it was a murder attempt but the wrong person was killed.\n\n",
    "People": "- 27 years old\n- Mantendo Game developer\n- 27 years old\n- Mantendo Game developer\n- 27 years old\n- Mantendo Game developer\n- Mantendo director\n- Victim (explosion)\n- Black Organization member\n- Deceased (suicide)\n- University Boxing Club manager\n- Previously dated Takeshita and Nakajima\n- Dumped by Nakajima\n",
    "Resolution": "Conan reveals that Tequila and Hideaki Nakajima, one of the game designers, secretly exchanged suitcases. Conan reveals that the bomber is game designer Hironobu Takeshita and that Nakajima was his intended target. As evidence, Conan reveals that Nakajima's suitcase's key would fit into the suitcase Takeshita is holding since that is originally Nakajima's suitcase. The mix-up happened due to the fact that Takeshita had switched the numbers before Nakajima made the exchange with the victim. As a result the suitcase with the bomb was given to Tequila instead. Takeshita confesses and denounces Nakajima for leading Yoshimi (their university boxing club manager who had dated Takeshita and Nakajima afterwards) to suicide when he dumped her.\nFurther evidence is the number of the hotel keys; Kogoro's is 96 while Ran's is 100. Hironobu feared his plan would fall apart if the number he and his victim had were too different; he convinced his co-workers to cut in front of Ran to ensure all three had a number in the 90s. Another piece of evidence is the fact that Conan as Kogoro instructed Megure to check Nakajima’s suitcase, thinking that he had the case with the bomb Hironobu braced himself. But in the suitcase was only money Nakajima had recieved from tequilla, which proves his guilt as he believed that the bomb he planted in his suitcase was going to explode.\nConan asks Nakajima what he knows about Tequila's acquaintances only to learn that he always meets them in the \"Cocktail\" bar at the Daikoku building.[1] Conan heads there only to find out Gin and Vodka had caused an explosion to hide evidence of them being there.\n\n",
    "Continuity error": "By the time that this story was told in the manga, Conan had a second encounter with Gin and Vodka (learning their names in the process), as well as learning about the organization. In the anime, however, The Shinkansen's Bomb Case and The Strange Person Hunt Murder Case omitted ties to The Organization and its members. Thus Conan at this point in the anime shouldn't know the names of the men who shrank him, or their organization. Funimation fixes this problem in English dub of Diplomat Murder Case, where Heiji hints at the names of both Gin and Vodka. This makes it plausible for Conan to recall their names in this episode.\n",
    "Translation changes": "",
    "Anime": "- The names of the characters in the Funimation Dub are:\n- Hideaki Nakajima - Henry Nelbit\n- Koji Ueda - Kelvin Tug\n- Hironobu Takeshita - Charles Shore\n- Ishikawa - George Fuman\n- Yoshimi - Bonnie Shore\n- Daikoku Building - Apollo Building\n- Bonnie Shore's fate is ambiguous in the dub instead of committing suicide, which also changed her relationship with Charles Shore as ex-wife after they divorced when Charles found out she had an affair with Henry Nelbit, according to Kelvin. It could be implied that Bonnie might've went on her own path after she and Charles divorced.\nConan upon hearing Kogoro mentioning having some Gin and Vodka, recalls that Heiji Hattori telling him that the two men in black who he met went by the name of Gin and Vodka. In the Japanese Version, he merely recalls that those were the two men responsible for his condition, however he should still not know their names, since he never learned their names at all.\nThis particular error originated in the Dub for Diplomat Murder Case. Presumably, this was done as a means of explaining how Conan knows the codename of the two men due to their omission in several episodes, but Heiji wouldn't discover Conan's secret until Holmes Freak Murder Case.\n",
    "Manga": "- Due to Viz Media originally referring to Gin and Vodka as Kaspar and Melkior (volume 4), their translation of this story in volume 12 has Conan's recollection of the two brought on by Kogoro mentioning that he had Kaspar Gin and Melkior Vodka. Following this, volume 18 is the final time that Viz continued with altered names.\n",
    "Trivia": "- In the English dub, the explosion in the Apollo Building killed 23 people, some of whom could not be identified by authorities.\n- Mantendo is a reference to Nintendo Co., Ltd., a Japanese video game company.\n- Technically this is one of the few cases that Conan solves as The Sleeping Kogoro without knocking him out with his Stun-Gun Wristwatch, as he misfires and hits Ran on the butt, and upon attempting to retrieve the dart (which was stuck on the coat check tickets) she does a roundhouse kick, hitting Kogoro in the forehead in the process and knocking him out.\n- Years later, this case would be mentioned again in episode 308 due to Tequila being brought up by the associates of Suguru Itakura and Tequila having visited Itakura regarding a computer program that he wanted for the Organization along with Vermouth. In that case, Kogoro reassures Itakura's friends that the tall man with the black suit and mustache couldn't be the culprit for Itakura's absence, as the individual described (Tequila) was killed in a bombing accident a while back.\n",
