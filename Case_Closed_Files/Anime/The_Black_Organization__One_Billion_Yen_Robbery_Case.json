    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "While at the bank, Conan witnesses bank robbers driving away with the 1 billion yen in a truck. The police finds the abandoned truck under the bridge and come upon a mask used for the robbery.\n\nThe lipstick on the mask suggests that Masami Hirota is the culprit in the robbery. Later that night, Gin and Vodka assassinate the two other bank robbers and place Hirota's lipstick at the crime scene.\n\n\nConan realizes that an unknown assailant is attempting to lure Hirota out of hiding.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (gunshot)\n- Race driver\n- Victim (gunshot)\n- Yotsubishi Bank armored convoy guard\n- Victim (blunt trauma - injured)\n- Yotsubishi Bank armored convoy guard\n- Victim (blunt trauma - injured)\n- Yotsubishi Bank armored convoy guard\n- Yotsubishi Bank Beika Branch manager\n- Masami's superior\n",
    "Resolution": "Almost at the end of the day, Hirota comes face to face with Gin and Vodka. She asks them why did they kill the other two, and they tell her that's just how the Organization does things. Then she asks Gin to release her little sister in exchange for the 1 billion yen she stole from the bank, betting on how they can't kill her because they won't get the money otherwise. Gin however shoots her fatally before she can do the same to him, and Vodka takes the keys to a coin locker containing the money from the robbery.\n\n",
    "Plothole note": "The manga version of The Strange Person Hunt Murder Case ended with Akemi Miyano encountering and being fatally wounded by Gin, then being found by Ran and Conan, and finally dying in Conan's arms.\nThe anime production team heavily altered the case in the Episode 13 version because they thought the anime was only going to last one season and end with Movie 1. Once they realized the show was going to continue, they had to redo the case and sticking closer to the manga version.\nSince the story is very important to the continuity, such as leading up to Ai Haibara's appearance, this episode was made to fix the plot hole. The murder scene proper is very similar to the original one, save for three details: Ran isn't present until after Akemi dies, Shiho Miyano's silhouette when Akemi brings up her sister is omited, and the blood on the scene is severely censored.\nNotably, the anime special Episode One: The Great Detective Turned Small, a re-telling of the first two episodes, showed a flashforward of Akemi's death and followed the manga version.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Gin can be obviously seen using his right hand to fire the gun. Every other time Gin had used his left hand. It is assumed this was just a discontinuity, and does not suggest the fact that Gin is ambidextrous. Episode ONE shows Gin using his left hand in the re-adapted scene, same as the manga case.\n- This is the first episode where Officer Tome is referred to by name.\n- Shiro Kaizuka and the robbers packed the money in a white 1996 Mazda Demio (Mazda 121) [DW].\n- Akemi Miyano's car used to see Gin is a vibrant red 1994 Ford Mustang (fourth generation).\n- Although Kogoro, Ran, and Conan have met Masami Hirota, abet as a teenage girl in appearance in The Strange Person Hunt Murder Case, Ran and Kogoro appear completely unfamiliar to her.\n"
