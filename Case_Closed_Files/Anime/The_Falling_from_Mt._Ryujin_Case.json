    "Situation": "The Detective Boys, excluding Haibara, are traveling through a winding path call Tsuzuraori Pass on Mt. Ryujin in the Nishitama District. Ayumi is amazed by the scenery and Professor Agasa tells her that they are barely halfway to the top of mountain.\nAgasa then tells Conan and the others about the Tsuzuraori Pass being famous and that it has 99 turns, causing Genta to feel sick after hearing about it.\nLater that day, they witness a car falling off the mountain. Conan rushes to the scene while asking Agasa to call the police and an ambulance. He starts investigating.\n\nWhile the police is questioning Agasa, Conan investigates and notices dents at the back of the trunk. A police officer asks Agasa if he saw any suspicious people or vehicles, to which he replies no.\nConan asks the police officer if he can go and see what the other investigators are doing, but he replies that it's not something that children should see. Still, Conan manages to enter the crime scene, and notices the tire tracks. The forensics estimated the tire tracks to be 16.33 meters long and discovered a dark blue paint chip, concluding that another car had rammed into it.\nConan concludes that it wasn't an accident, but a murder, and searches for clues. Mitsuhiko finds a code from the car wreckage, but hides it from Conan because he always wants to solve the case by himself. After sharing the code with the other Detective Boys, they conclude that the code could be a treasure map.\n",
    "People": "- Mysterious man wearing sunglasses\n- Nishitama Police detective\n- Victim (car crash)\n- Silver car driver\n- Tokyo MPD Police officer\n- Tokyo MPD Police officer\n- Tokyo MPD Forensics officer\n- Tokyo MPD Forensics officer\n",
    "Resolution": "\nConan solves the code quickly and arrives with the cops just in time to save the kids from the culprit.\n- Although the man tried to claim his action as an accident, the speed of his car and the distance between the two car crashes countered his claim. Since the man was driving his car at 30 km/hr and the distance between the first and second crash is roughly 16 metre he must had crashed into the victim's car twice within 2 seconds, proving that the incident is truly murder.\nThe victim was also a member of the illegal vehicle robbery group who fled with one of the cars, motivating the man to silence him before the ring could be exposed.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The culprit's SUV is a Dark Blue Pearl/Nightshadow Pearl 1996 Toyota Land Cruiser Prado [J90]. The license plate number is 日野 300 • か 1 06 (Hino 300 • Ka 1 06).\n- The victim's car is a silver Mercedes-Benz CL500 coupé [C140]. The license plate number is 新宿 300 • や 2 28 (Shinjuku 300 • Ya 2 28).\n- The five illegaly bought vehicles in the hideout are a purple BMW 750iL [E38], a silvery blue Mercedes-Benz E-Klasse [W210], a black Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit, a red Jaguar XJ [X300] (no license) and a Rosso Corsa 1995 Ferrari F50 (no license).\n- The 99 turns road is modeled after the Tongtian Road to Tianmen Mountain in China and the Irohazaka Winding Road in Nikko, Tochigi Prefecture.\n- The Benz falling from mountain is a Chapman's Peak crash.\n"
