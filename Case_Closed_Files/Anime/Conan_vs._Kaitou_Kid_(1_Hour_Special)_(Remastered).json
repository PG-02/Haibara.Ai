    "Situation": "Sonoko's family wants Kogoro to protect their priceless piece of jewelry called the Black Star from the Phantom Thief. The necklace along with other valuables will be on display at a museum where people are sure the Phantom will strike. The Phantom left a coded letter to Sonoko's father and its the first clue.\nAfter decoding the letter, Conan goes to meet the Phantom Thief face to face at a rooftop of a hotel. He lights a firework hoping that the cops would come and arrest him, but to his surprise Kid imitates the inspector's voice and calls all of the inspector's men to the rooftop. Just when it looks like the Phantom Thief is cornered he escapes with a blast bomb and leaves another note containg another clue.\nThis time the note states that he will board the ship that is carrying the Black Star. While last time was a test run this time he will actually steal the Black Star. To try and prevent this, Tomoko devises a plan. She has given all the guests a fake Black Star replica in hopes that Kaitou Kid won't be able to figure it out before the cruise ends. Sonoko can't find her sister so she calls her and finds out that her sister and dad are still at home. This means that the Shiro Suzuki they just saw had to be the Kaitou Kid in disguise.\nTomoko brings in a magician to put on a show but Kaitou Kid then drops another letter. Fake Black Stars start exploding and the guests start panicking. Thats when he steals the real Black Star which Tomoko was wearing the whole time. Conan on the other hand has figured out where and who the Kaitou Kid is.\n",

    "Resolution": "The defeated Kaitou Kid comes clean and hands Conan back the pearl, after Conan destroys the phone so he couldnt pull the same trick again. Conan reveals that Kaitou Kid escaped last time by disguising himself as a cop and blending in, but he can stop him now.\nRight when Conan is about to use his powered shoes and a ball to try hitting Kaitou Kid, he tells Conan that he knocked Ran out to take her red dress and she might freeze outside in the lifeboat (where he hid her), since he left her naked. Conan is very flustered and distracted, so Kaitou Kid drops another blast bomb and escapes, leaving the red dress on the floor. A very flustered Conan takes the dress and decides to go to Ran instead, fearing she'd get sick or be found naked - but finds out Kaitou Kid never took her clothes and she's fully dressed. Before the event on the ship, Ran had her dress dry cleaned and the guy who brought it was Kaitou Kid under a busboy disguise. He had made a duplicate of the dress before handing Ran hers. This is explained in a written card Kaitou left for Ran, apologizing for any annoyances and telling her how cute she is.\n",
