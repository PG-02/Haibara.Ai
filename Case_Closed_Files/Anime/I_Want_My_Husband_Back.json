    "Situation": "At morning in Kasuba town, a guy accidentally runs over an old man after trying to avoid a cat. The only witness is an old lady. The culprit of the accident, Hajime Inukai, lies after saying that he will drive to the hospital to save the man.\n\nThe victim's name is Daijiro Butsumaru, who is a company president and a large estate owner. After seeing the hit-and-run case in the TV, the victim's wife Emiko Butsumaru asks for Kogoro's help to bring her husband back. Later they recieve a call of an unknown person, who offers Emiko to buy her husband's body for 10 million yen, or else she will never see his body again, and also they mention that they knows she needs it.\n\nThey also found Inukai in Kasuba Town, who confess everything and the location of the buried body, but it turns out the unknown person who offered to sell the body robbed it from there, so Inukai isn't the culprit of the stolen body. The culprit decides to raise the price to 30 million yen. Later, Kogoro and Conan discover the main safe in Butsumaru House who only opens with facial recognition, and Emiko says that all of the \"memories\" are inside the safe, that's because she is willing to pay that quantity. After the Kasuba police arrest Inukai, Megure and Takagi arrive to the house, and reveal that Butsumaru had rented an apartment in Kasuba city and that's probably the motive why he was there at the time of the accident. Meanwhile, Emiko is mad for something. Conan asks Emiko if she noticed something strange in Daijiro, she only says that he received a call of Kadokura telling him that he will be okay and he also tells him that he will arrive to work late. Conan then connects the pieces to solve the case.\n",
