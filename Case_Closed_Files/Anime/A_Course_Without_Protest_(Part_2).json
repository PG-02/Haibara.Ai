    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan fly to Okinawa to attend an interview with a famous baseball player, Toshio Nose. On the way there, they witness the player dead on the street.\n\nConan suspects Motoyama, since he urged his companions to call not just an ambulance but also the police, suggesting that Motoyama knew that Nose would be beyond help, but Motoyama has apparently an alibi. He came off his flight to Okinawa at about 9:50 am, while the murder was committed about twenty minutes earlier. Conan begins also to suspect him to be part of the Black Organization.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (stabbed)\n- Professional baseball player\n- Sports reporter\n- Former professional baseball player with Nose\n- Naha Police inspector\n- Naha Police detective\n- Nichiuri TV sales rep Okinawa branch\n- Former high-school baseball player\n- Sports News announcer\n- Sports News announcer\n- Okinawa Prefecture police forensics officer\n- TV producer\n- Okinawa Naha Airport security guard\n",
    "Resolution": "Motoyama was incidentally on the same flight Conan, Ran and Kogoro had boarded and, in disguise, had caught one of the balls Ran had inadvertently dropped. While the tennis ball's felt coating could not retain Motoyama's fingerprints, Kogoro has suggested otherwise in order to have Motoyama guide him and the police to the location of the bloodstained raincoat and murder knife, still hidden in the trunk of the car Motoyama rented for the deed. Another clue was that, when he first met the Moris, he already knew that Conan, who stood apart from Kogoro and Ran at that time, was part of their company, proving that he had seen them together before, i.e. on Flight JAL 931.\nThe reason behind the murder was that Nose had suggested to Motoyama, who was a celebrated baseball pitcher himself at that time, that his throwing technique was flawed, prompting Motoyama to practice his pitching obsessively until his throwing arm was ruined. While Nose subsequently used his contacts to get Motoyama the sports reporting job, a shocked Motoyama learned later, through an unedited studio recording of a sports talkshow, that Nose had intentionally caused Motoyama to drop out of active sports in order to get rid of, what he considered, his competitor for fame.\n",
    "Trivia": "- In the manga Japanese version, the hiragana ideograms on Motoyama's first name meaning \"Seiji\" and not \"Masaharu\".\n- This episode has, at certain points, captions stating time, place and date, it is similar to other cop/crime shows, like Law and Order series franshise.\n- Detective Irabu's vehicle is a Cyan Toyota Estima XR40.\n- Masaharu Motoyama's car in the airport is a Dark Blue 1993 Toyota Crown Sedan S140. The license plate number is 琉球 300, わ 72-65 (Ryukyu 300, Wa 72-65).\n",
