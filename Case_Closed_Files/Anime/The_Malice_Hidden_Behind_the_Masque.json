    "Situation": "Kogoro is invited by the manager of a theater to investigate strange occurrences. While Conan goes off to investigate on his own, he overhears Hiroshi Komazuka, one of the main actors, plan on switching a fake rapier with a real one to murder Robert Banno, another main actor, in the sword fight scene of the play. Komazuka realizes Conan overheard him and traps him in a sarcophagus prop in the storage room. Robert sets up a trap on the stage in order to electrocute the actor named Atsushi Yabuki. When Robert learns that the fake rapier has been switched with the real one, he decides to pursue Yabuki to trade roles with him so he may murder Yabuki in person. Yabuki agrees and as Robert leaves, Yabuki reveals his plan to poison the wine Komazuka drinks during the play.\n\n",
