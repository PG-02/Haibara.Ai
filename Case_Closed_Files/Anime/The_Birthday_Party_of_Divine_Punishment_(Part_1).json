    "Situation": "Ran, Sonoko, and Sera are invited by Yumi Sekizawa, their classmate, to her and her sister, Remi Sekizawa's birthday party. Conan is having mouth ulcer, but Kogoro is attending a neighborhood association meeting, so Conan ended up attending the party. Later, Ran asks him to take his medicine. The medicine is stored in the case where he is keeping the APTX4869 antidote Haibara gave him for his school trip. Sera sees the antidote and asks Conan about it, but Conan refuse to answer her. Sera then calls Mary to report about the antidote. Mary instructs Sera to steal the antidote.\nThe group then meet Remi, Yumi's sister who become a model. They also meet her manager Mitomu Kushiyama, Remi's high school classmate and pastry chef Tsuguo Hatsune, and hair and makeup artist Mizutoshi Hanasaki. Yumi reveals that Hanasaki has hit on and been rejected by Remi despite having a wife and kid. Remi also complained that he even hit on her the other day. It is also the reason why Remi invited Ran, Sonoko, and Sera, so that Hanasaki can't try hitting on her.\nThe party goes well, and it is the time for the birthday cake. People sing \"Happy Birthday\", while Hatsune brings the cake into the room. After blowing the candle, Remi notices that Hanasaki's glasses are glowing in the dark. The cake then get distributed while the projector shows Remi and Yumi's childhood photos.\nSuddenly, Hanasaki screams in pain, before collapsed to the floor. Not long after, the projector get turned off, and the room become very dark. One of the staff incidently broke a wine bottle. Conan then notices that there is someone near Hanasaki's head. Later, the light is turned on, revealing Hanasaki's dead body, along with the word \"Divine Punishment\" written on his head.\n\nThe police then come and investigate the crime scene. They found a bottle of cyanide taped beneath the table at Hanasaki's seat. Sera explains that the murder scene is a closed space, where the broken wine bottle is on the right side of the table, and the door leading to the kitchen is opened, but no one came through it, which means the suspects are the person who is in the area, including Remi, Yumi, Hatsune, and Kushiyama. Ran and Sonoko doesn't like the fact that Yumi is one of the suspects, but it is because she knows Hanasaki.\nThe police then start questioning the suspects. Hatsune, who is the last person to be questioned, suggests the police to search for the marker used to write down the word on Hanasaki's head. Hatsune don't have any. There is a not-working permanet marker inside Remi's bag, who is held by Kushiyama. The marker is confirmed not working before the party when Ran asked for Remi's autograph. It leaves Yumi, who has a working marker in her bag.\nSera suddenly receive a call from Mary, who asks if she has get the antidote. Sera tells Mary that someone is poisoned at the party, and that she will call back later. Hearing that, Mary recalls the moment she got shrunken.\n\nLater, Mary screamed in pain, and fell down from the bridge into the river. Vermouth then quickly left the bridge. Mary managed to went back to the hotel, and tell Sera that she got shrunken.\n- Black Organization member\n- Black Organization member\n- Passerby\n- Passerby\nThe police later found a large amount of poison on Hanasaki's cake. When Takagi is pointing out the position of Yumi's bag during the murder, he notices a stain on the floor. Sera says that the stain was not there before Hanasaki was killed.\nLater, Chiba reports that a working marker is found in the kitchen's garbage bin. The police then suspects Hatsune, who was standing near the door leading to the kitchen. Hearing that, Hatsune complained that the police is no different from Hanasaki, who was known as serial complainer. Hearing that, Conan and Sera finally solve the case.\n",

    "Resolution": "In order to make the marker functional again, Kushiyama poured nail polish remover into the marker cap. After using the marker, he poured the nail polish remover on the floor and removed the cap so the marker wouldn't work again. Sera deduces that it was also Kushiyama who convinced Hanasaki to wear the glowing glasses by telling him that Remi would like it. He is also the person who threw another marker in kitchen's garbage bin.\nThe motive is that Kushiyama was the person who took away half-finished soft drinks and snacks from Remi's makeup room. Hanasaki saw him and decided to blackmail him with it for money. The amount of money keep increasing that he felt that Hanasaki should be killed.\nKushiyama then grabs the chair and tries to run away. Sera, instead of beating him, decides to hug Conan. Ran then kicks the chair so hard that it is stuck on the ceiling. She then hit Kushiyama on his head using her karate. After Kushiyama is arrested, Sera decides to leave. It is at this moment when Conan realizes that his medicine case is gone.\n\nLater, Sera reports to Mary that she has got the anitidote. Mary then recalls again the moment she returned to the hotel after got shrunken. On that day, Minerva Glass was playing at Wimbledon. Sera recorded the match and was watching it. While she and Mary were discussing their next movement, the TV showed Conan shouting at Minerva that he is Holmes' apprentice. Both Mary and Sera realized that the boy looks like the boy they met at the beach long time ago, Shinichi Kudo.\nMary then asked her MI6 colleagues to look into Shinichi. Shinichi Kudo was on the flight passenger list, but he has no younger brother, and his companions were not relatives. Mary also got the information that Shinichi is high school detective who solved many cases while they have been away from Japan. However, it stopped in the past six months. Instead, Conan suddenly appeared frequently at crime scenes. Mary then deduced that Shinichi also got shrunken and somehow restores his body when he boarded the plane. Mary then said that they must acquire the antidote whatever it takes.\n",
