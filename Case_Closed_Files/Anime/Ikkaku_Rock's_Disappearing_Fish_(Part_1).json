On the way home, they decide to explore an island named Ikkaku Rock and come upon a dead woman's body.\n\nConan deduces, from her wristwatch bearing her name, the woman to be Akamine Hikari, the daughter of the head of a famous company. Conan reveals that Akamine was murdered and reveals that her dying message were the names of the fishes \"Mackerel, Carp, Sea Bream, and Flounder\" in katakana. Akamine's diving companions Rokusuke Oto, Shuhei Aosato, Yasuji Kaita, arrive on the island and reveal that Akamine went missing on their last diving trip but they thought she was okay due to her message, \"Take care of the rest\".\nWhile Inspector Yokomizo interrogates the three, the Detective Boys try to figure out the meaning of the dying message. Conan realizes that on Akamine's watch, the word \"Fish\" is scratched out and finds out the meaning of the dying message.\n",

The title was: \"Jiu-Jitsu et Boxe - Une victoire japonaise\", which is translated as: \"Jujutsu and Boxing - a Japanese victory\", featuring a match between Ré-nié and Dubois.[1]\n",
