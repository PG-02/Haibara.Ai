    "Situation": "Kogoro is in the hospital after his leg injured by a criminal he was chasing down. While there, he witnesses a silhouette of one person stabbing another person in the back. He notifies the nurses immediately, only to find out that the room in which the murder took place is empty. This happens continuously for three nights in a row, before an actual murder has taken place on the 4th night. Even worse, Kogoro is found passed out next to the corpse and mistaken to be the killer, and now Conan will have to clear his name.\n\nEvery time, he witnessed the murder occurring, dialed 110 (for the police). Every time when he went to the room where the murder occurred, the body was no where to be found. All of the patients, nurses, and doctors were wondering where the victim is and if there was a victim at all.\n\nDoctor Mitsuo said that Kogoro was most likely hallucinating because he had been involved in many murder cases. Conan starting investigating the room where the murders had been supposedly occurring.\n\nConan decided to stay with Kogoro to watch the murders to see if would still occur and it did. Doctor Mitsuo set the alarm on the clock to 11:00. At 11:30, they witnessed the real murder. Kogoro was struck in the head and knocked unconscious, with his fingerprints on the knife.\n\nKogoro, who had been struck, believes that he is Doctor Eto's murderer. Ran, who learned what was very shocked and terrified that her father was a suspect for a murder. Conan says that we (Conan and Kogoro) witnessed the crime taking place from his room. But, Megure said that Conan could be covering for Kogoro to protect him.\n\nConan after investigating is able to pin down the true culprit.\n",
    "People": "- 26 years old\n- East Beika General Hospital nurse\n- 40 years old\n- East Beika General Hospital physician\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- 40 years old\n- East Beika General Hospital surgeon\n- East Beika General Hospital nurse\n- Arrested\n- Criminal Kogoro was chasing\n- East Beika General Hospital nurse\n- Tokyo MPD police officer\n- Tokyo MPD police officer\n",
    "Resolution": "The first three murders were to make it look like Kogoro was imagining things, and thus would appear to be losing his mind and he would be an easy target for pinning the murder on. The culprit who murdered Eto is Mitsuo Shirai. The evidence is his coffee cup, he was served coffee by a nurse who left it in his room. His fingerprints were no where to be found on from the cup he supposedly drank from, in reality he actually rinsed the cup holding it from its handle while wearing latex gloves.\nIf he had drank coffee why would he need to wear latex gloves? The reason being he had just knocked out Kogoro with the blunt weapon. Doctor Mitsuo refutes saying that he washed away his fingerprints when he was cleaning the cup he drank from. However Conan as Kogoro says that cannot be possible as the nurse's fingerprints were on that cup, meaning that he wants them to believe that when he washed the coffee cup, he somehow managed to leave the nurse's fingerprints intact while washing off his.\n",
