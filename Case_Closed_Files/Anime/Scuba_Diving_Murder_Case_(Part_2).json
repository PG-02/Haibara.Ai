    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Ran secretly plans for her parents to meet at the beach in hopes of reuniting them. While there, they come upon Kiwako and Masahiko, who are childhood sweethearts and are engaged. When Kiwako gets bitten by a sea snake it appears a freakish accident has taken place, but Conan suspects there is more than what the regular eye can see.\n\nConan knows a love triangle is involved in Kiwako's attack, but is Kawazu or is Harumi the culprit?\n",
    "People": "- Victim (poison - injured)\n- University student\n- Masahiko's fiancee\n- Diving club member\n- University student\n- Masahiko's younger sister\n- Diving club member\n- University student\n- Diving club senior member\n- University student\n- Diving club member\n- University student\n- Kiwako and Masahiko's childhood friend\n- Diving club member\n- Shizuoka Fire Department paramedic\n- Izu Queen Hotel front desk\n- Izu Queen Hotel employee\n- Kogoro's fan\n- Kogoro's fan\n- Izu Central Hospital nurse\n- Izu Central Hospital nurse\n- Izu Central Hospital doctor\n",
    "Resolution": "",
    "Evidence": "- The snake bite was in an unusual place, it was right below Kiwako’s knuckles which is odd since the snake’s mouth was small. The areas that the snake would and should have bitten was a person’s fingers or toes.\n- Ran after identifying the snake, also revealed that she noticed something odd by the snake as it apparently had wings on its back.\n- Harumi’s belongings that she kept in her fanny pack was laid out on her bed, rather then in her bag which Conan found odd.\n- Harumi used her fanny pack to house the snake as well as used scotch tape to keep it restrained so that it would not bite her. When the time came she simply pulled the sea snake out and held mouth open and dug its venomous fangs into Kiwako’s hand.\n",
    "Conclusion": "Harumi Matsuzaki was the culprit.\n",
    "Motive": "Harumi and Masahiko were step-siblings due to her mom marrying his dad when she was in the 2nd year of high school, but she had a secret crush on him. Conan suspected such things because everyone had referred to Kiwako, Masahiko, and Hiroshi as childhood friends, but didn't include Harumi, which was strange since she and Kiwako are of the same age. Harumi's emotional stability took a nosedive when he decided to marry Kiwako, but when an oblivious Kiwako asked her for help to \"prove\" Masahiko's love via pretending to drown. Harumi got upset over Kiwako's 'selfishness' that she decided to kill her by catching a snake, hiding in in her beltbag and then releasing it during the \"prank\", making it bite Kiwako.\n",
    "Aftermath": "When Kiwako was fully healed via the antidote, she spoke to Harumi in private and told her she had decided to keep the attempted murder a secret and not reveal anything to the police. She considered Harumi's attempt on her \"karma\" for having been insensitive and selfish not only about Masahiko's feelings, but also Harumi's. Harumi was sincerely touched by Kiwako's forgiveness, and cried in relief.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Eri Kisaki's vehicle is a cyan 1990 Rover Mini Cooper MkV [ADO20].\n- The snake used by the culprit in the case, the black-banded sea krait, is not endemic to the Izu region, as it can only be found in the Okinawan islands in Japan. This supports the fact that this was an attempted murder and not an accident.\n- Apart from being all university students and members of a diving club, the suspects have names that are all related to cities in Izu Peninsula:\n- Kiwako Toda (戸田貴和子) being related to the former Heda village (戸田);\n- Harumi Matsuzaki (松崎はるみ) and Masahiko Matsuzaki (松崎雅彦) being related to Matsuzaki town (松崎);\n- Hiroshi Ito (伊東洋) being related to Ito city (伊東);\n- Kunio Kawazu (河津邦生) being related to Kawazu town (河津).\n- This was probably not dubbed in Arabic because most female characters wore swimsuits.\n",
