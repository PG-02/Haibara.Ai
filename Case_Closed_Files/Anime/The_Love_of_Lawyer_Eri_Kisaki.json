    "Situation": "Eri Kisaki is visited by Ran and Conan who came to remind her it is the anniversary of her first date with Kogoro. Eri leaves to meet someone at a café after a phone call. Shortly after Eri's cat, Goro, knocks down a vase where Ran finds a picture of a man and her mother's wedding ring. They notice the number on the back of the picture matches the number of the caller causing Ran to believe that her mother is having an affair and thus follows her to the café. Once there, Ran hears the man speak with a woman in a baby talk tone. Eri tearfully tells the man she \"could not stop the trembling\" and the man replies \"it is just a dream\".\n",
