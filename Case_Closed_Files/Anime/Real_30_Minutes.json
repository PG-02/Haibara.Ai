    "Situation": "Conan and Ran accompany Kogoro into a shopping mall, where he has arranged a dinner reservation at a restaurant. Since the reservation is set for 8 pm, however, Conan and Ran have half an hour to kill, so they split up to look around their favorite merchandise. An unpopular mall visitor is stabbed, though he is still alive.\n\nStrangely, the police arrives quite early, since a call has been made to them at exactly 7:30, just a few minutes before the deed was committed. Conan meets Haibara, who has been browsing a nearby bookshop, and they investigate the case together.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (stabbed - injured)\n- DVD and VHS store employee\n- Cosmetics store manager\n- Suspicious woman\n- Tianjin chestnut shop manager\n",
    "Resolution": "- Deceased (car accident)\n- Naosuke's girlfriend\n- Culprit\n- Businessman\nThis makes him conclude that the attack was only a diversion, to have the mall sealed off so that his actual victim could not escape and the brutish men couldn't get in. Since the cell phone message was passed to a switched-off phone, Conan and Haibara conclude that the culprit sits inside the mall's dentist office.\n\nThe culprit, Naosuke Kurosawa, as it turns out, was going after the boss of the two thugs, a wealthy and influential businessman, Taizou Masuda, who has killed his girlfriend in a hit and run.\n\n",
    "Trivia": "- Taizou Masuda's vehicle in the accident is a Mercedes-Benz E-class (W210) with the license plate 23-20.\n- As one looks at the upper right-hand corner, one can see the airing time in relation to the show.\n"
