    "Situation": "On an idly day, near the pavement located next to a shrine, the stick repeatedly danced upon the drum, which created a sound reverberating around the whole street, lacing with a melancholy melody that came out of a clarinet. The Detective Boys were deeply attracted by the graceful music and followed behind the three music players. The three folks led them towards a newly opened candy shop nearby, and they seemed to be the staff responsible for celebrating it. The emaciated man, wearing a purple kimono decided to hand the Detective Boys a plum for each of them, in order to commemorate this jubilant day. Ayumi, Genta, and Mitsuhiko all claimed that they had never seen anything like this plum before. After the three of them tasted it, they were all astonished by the luscious flavour of it. While Conan did not impersonate the others, he gazed at the plum in his hand, and looked rather dejected. Genta then questioned Conan about whether he was looking down at candies, yet Conan denied it, and remarked mercilessly, \"It's just that candy for kids.\" then just put the plum inside his pockets. Genta got fairly piqued after hearing Conan's thoughts, and told Conan that he ought not pretend to be a grownup. Mitsuhiko also echoed, stating that people like Conan are being classified as arrogant. Although Conan kept declining being arrogant, Genta started a quarrel with Conan about it. Finally, suppressing his anger, Conan walked off.\nAfter leaving the Detective Boys, Conan alone, walked along the pavement grumbling. Abruptly, he came across an old man, who was wearing spectacles with frames embellished with gold. He had his full body dressed in grey, also had a grey hat on top of his head. Due to Conan's madness at the Detective Boys, he did not see the old man advancing towards him, thus Conan knocked him down undeliberately. Conan apologized to the old man and helped him picking up his spectacles. After he put his spectacles, he said something gradually: \"I saw a corpse, an omurice corpse.\"\n\nConan sighed and thought that was non-sense, and attempted to walking away. However, the old man seemed to be raged and grabbed Conan back, meanwhile shouting sentences like \"Don't turn your back on the elderly!\" He held Conan in his arms, carried him at an gloomy alley full of bamboos grown. Conan did not understand, and inquired of the old man where was the so-called \"omurice corpse\", the old man then realised that the corpse was grisly gone. The old man then accused Conan eating the omurice, Conan keenly escaped out of the old man's arm timely, unfortunately got obstructed by the end of the small alley. The end of the alley happened to be a wooden door with a layer of dust deposited onto it, apparently not being used for a while. As Conan peered upwards, a signboard with \"Jurakudai\" had been engraved on top of it came into sight. Conan then noticed that this was the name of the restaurant that he had been before with Ran.\nThree months ago, it used to be a famed and popular restaurant that served western foods. Conan recalled the last time he visited the Jurakudai Restaurant with Ran.\nWhen they walked into the restaurant entrance hall, there was a big aquarium-like facility with all kinds of special dishes introduced exclusively by the restaurant flowing all around the water inside the aquarium. This can be considered the menu of this peculiar restaurant. When they turned their heads to the left, they saw the chef-owner of the restaurant, Jurakudai, who was busy in the kitchen. At that time, he was jugging kitchen dishes ingeniously and had none of them broken into pieces. There were three staff members employed by him also standing nearby, praising his talent.\nMoreover, he had a world-class five-star dish named \"special kid's lunch\", which could be considered his special dish for the restaurant. This restaurant also had an interesting manner for ordering food, which was to use a special machine in the shape of a pink frog-like creature. By inserting cash into the machine, you would get a food ticket in exchange, and the food would be ordered. Ran recommended Conan try out the \"special kid's lunch\", as that was what this restaurant was famous for. Nevertheless, Conan did not want it and said that a kid's lunch was still just a kid's lunch. This provoking statement got heard by the chef, and he seemed rather furious about it. Ran also perceived that Conan was acting like a grownup, and people who did not know him very well would most likely assume he was an arrogant kid. In the end, Conan decided to eat omurice, just like Ran, and not experience the \"special kid's lunch\". The chef got even more indignant after learning of Conan's decision.\nRan started ordering their food using the special food machine; she first found the corresponding machine, which was used for ordering omurice, and selected the number of dishes desired by using the lever that was installed on the right-hand side of the machine. After receiving the money and order, the eye of the pink frog suddenly emits laser light, and the chef inside the kitchen would accept it by absorbing the laser light using a cooking pan. The pan displayed \"Omurice II\" after the erosion of the laser light. \"SHOWTIME!!!\" The chef shouted with excitement. Namley, a tune of classical music kicked in; it was \"Eine kleine Nachtmusik\", composed by Wolfgang A. Mozart. The chef cooked the omurice along with this elegant classical music, with his three staffs dancing to cheer him up. After Jurakudai finished his cooking, the dishes were placed inside a steel pot cover. They were then sent into a rocket, which could fly from the kitchen and reach the dining area. On the customer side, Ran and Conan arrived at the dining area and saw a marvellous design of the room, with a universe background and 3D models of the moon, the earth, and even a rainbow swirling around. And most importantly, the dining tables and seats were located on a carousel. The rocket was dangling from the dining table where Ran and Conan were sitting, and the two dishes were then dropped downward and lied on top of the table using a parachute made of some sort of fabric. The most ingenious thing was that the parachute could then be used as a bib. Ran and Conan had their meal very gracefully, along with the accompaniment of classical music.\nBack to the present, Conan discovered a photo of him eating the omurice stuck on the wooden door, seemingly taken on his last visit to the restaurant. It was fixed with the tip of the stick that was attached to the flag, which was stabbed on top of the omurice in that restaurant. Conan surmised that the chef of the restaurant might have done it. He could easily take the photo inside the kitchen while he was eating the omurice. After this deduction, he then thought of the staff member who was playing the violin in the background when the chef was cooking. Conan seemed to understand what was going on, and turned his face towards the old man who was standing just behind him. And enquired if the omurice corpse the old man saw was himself, and surprisingly, the old man shook his head. Then Conan asked if the corpse was a long-haired high school girl wearing overalls (Ran Mouri), and the old man nodded. As Conan got shocked, he noticed a badge icon equipped on the old man's chest and then quickly discovered the old man's identity. The old man ghastly sneered afterwards, an earth-shattering action scenario was about to kick off.\n",
    "People": "- \"Restaurant Jurakudai\" chef and owner\n- \"Restaurant Jurakudai\" staff member\n- \"Restaurant Jurakudai\" staff member\n- \"Restaurant Jurakudai\" staff member\n",
    "Resolution": "Jurakudai first opened a candy shop and utilised his staff members who belonged to his restaurant in disguise as the candy shop staff, in order to lure the Detective Boys into the candy store. After knowing Conan's \"arrogant\" personality, he devised to hand the Detective Boys plums for tasting. Therefore, the quarrel between Conan and one of the members of the Detective Boys was bound to arise. In the meantime, Jurakudai disguised himself as the old man and deliberately came across Conan, insisting that he had seen an omurice corpse that did not even exist, thus luring Conan to the bamboo alley he intended. This was to let Conan see his shut-down restaurant.\nConan then learned that Jurakudai's restaurant getting shut down was all due to Conan's arrogant words he uttered last time, as his pride then went down the drain after Conan's negative speech. He also explained that when he heard Conan's statement in the restaurant at that time, he was completely incensed and really wanted assult Conan, but his staff members stifled him. After that, his shattered pride began to affect his cooking, thus the quality of the dish also dropped, and eventually the restaurant crumbled. What he wanted to do was take revenge, as, from his perspective, Conan had ruined all of his career.\nConan sensed his danger and started escaping. Nontheless, the only entrance to the alley was entirely blocked by the three staff members Conan met in the candy shop, so there was no way to escape. The chef revealed his nefarious-looking face and laughed: \"Welcome to special kid's lunch hell.\" After saying that, he opened the wooden door of the closed restaurant and got pushed into it by the three staff members behind him.\nInside the dark room, a beam of light emerged, which shined at a carousel horse, and the classical music \"Eine kleine Nachtmusik\" resumed playing once again. Jurakudai, wearing a costume in the shape of his \"special kid's lunch\", gazed at Conan. He explained that this costume was made for the 3rd anniversary festival of his creative dish \"special kid's lunch\". After saying this, he instructed his staff members, who were also inside the closed restaurant, to catch Conan with a gruesome face. The staff members, also wearing different kinds of food costumes, advanced towards Conan and were trying to catch him.\nJurakudai laughed again and manipulated the special food ordering machines to attack and chase Conan as well. After receiving the command from Jurakudai, the machines opened their heads, and unexpectedly, there were springs that allowed them to throw food dishes at Conan. Right after the \"food attack\", Jurakudai introduced another \"weapon\" to persecute Conan: he filled the aquarium with cream soda, though to aggravate the damage, he then added paprika within it. Jurakudai looked rather satisfied with the aquarium filled with spicy cream soda and laughed fiendishly. Afterwards, he remoted a forklift to carry Conan into the aquarium. All of a sudden, Conan outwitted Jurakudai by taking out the plum given to him by the staff member in the candy shop out of his pocket and swiftly activating his Power-Enhancing Kick Shoes to kick it. The plum landed on the mechanical parts of the forklift. Anyhow, the forklift stopped working due to the water contamination. Conan then quickly kicked the chef and three staff members into the aquarium. Between the layer of the aquarium glass, Jurakudai admitted his fiasco, and Conan promised him that he would order the \"special kid's lunch\" next time visiting his restaurant.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The classical music the staff members were playing while the chef was cooking is called Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major (K. 525).\n- Due to its outrageous plot, the screenwriter Yoshio Urasawa and Detective Conan began trending on X after its initial airing.\n",
    "Quotes": "- The lip dialogue between Conan and Jurakudai in the end:\nConan Edogawa: The next time I'm here, I promise I'll order the special kid's lunch.  (江戸川コナン「今度来るときは絶対特製お子様ランチを食べるよ。」)\nJurakudai: A genius always becomes too proud. And pride comes before the fall.  (聚楽大「天才は思い上がる、そして思い下がる。」)\n",
