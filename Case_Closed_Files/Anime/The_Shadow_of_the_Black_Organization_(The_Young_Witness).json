    "Nail, Snake, and Hammer": "A rockstar named Roku Itakagi has been missing for the past few days. A young boy named Takumi Hashiratani claims that on New Year's Day, he witnessed a man carrying Itakagi in a bag and throwing him over a bridge. Takumi claims that the man had a dark car, a nail on arm, and that he saw a giant glowing hammer in the background. Kogoro is skeptical at first but realizes Takumi is telling the truth when the news confirms that the body of Itakagi was found in a bag floating in a river.\n\nFrom Takumi's testimony, Kogoro, Ran, Conan, and Eisuke search for the bridge where the body was thrown over.\nWhile investigating, they learn that Itakagi's band logo was of a snake with nails piercing through it. After questioning a tattooist, they learn that the tattoo was new and only three people have gotten it. After further investigation, they are able to deduce the tattoo is on the driver's right arm due to the traffic flow on the bridge and that the only way Takumi could have seen his arm is if the steering wheel was on the right side of the car. They realize that advertisement combined with lights from a building created the silhouette of an upside down hammer; Using this knowledge, they are able to pinpoint where the culprit threw the body off from the bridge.\n- Victim (beaten)\n- 22 years old\n- Musician\n- Witness\n- Takumi's father\n- Tattoo Shop Nail Snake customer\n- Tattoo Shop Nail Snake customer\n- Tattoo Shop Nail Snake customer\n- Breaking news announcer\n\n\n",
    "The Mysterious Job": "Eisuke asks Kogoro to investigate a mystery and believes that the crime is related to The Red-Headed League; Eisuke reveals that a man is paid a lot of money to switch the garbage from the neighborhood waste collection with the garbage from the previous garbage day. Kogoro takes Ran, Conan, and Eisuke with him to investigate the neighborhood. They run into Takagi who explains that a woman named Kaneyo Funemoto was recently murdered in the neighborhood after being shot in the back of her head while at home.\n\nHer son, Toji Funemoto, says that a strange foreign woman questioned him about an accident he witnessed and believes she murdered his mother. Conan realizes the woman is Vermouth and that the Black Organization must now know that Rena Mizunashi is currently hospitalized in a coma.\n- Victim (gunshot)\n- 39 years old\n- Tatsuhito's wife\n- 48 years old\n- Housekeeper\n- 43 years old\n- Funemoto Estate owner\n- 8 years old\n- Tatsuhito's son\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- The manga chapter ends with Conan finding out that Vermouth met Toji when he deduces that Toji heard was the last part of Vermouth famous quote \"A secret makes a Woman, Woman.\" Plus the anime episode ends with Gin remembering what the rat's name was Hondou.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Mr. Hashiratani's vehicle is a silver Toyota Crown Athlete [S180].\n- Kogoro's car in episode 462 is a black 2004 Toyota Crown [S180].\n- Kogoro's imagined vehicle is James Bond (Daniel Craig)'s lightning silver Aston Martin DBS V12 (2007-2012) in Casino Royale.\n- Kiritani's car is a 2001 nighthawk black pearl Honda Integra Type-R (DC5).\n- Roku Itagaki's first name is a pun to the type of music he was playing, Rock and Roll, which is pronounced in Japanese as Roku.\n- Even though the manga for the first part of this case was released on February 17, and the original airdate for the first part of this case was on January 29, Kogoro stated that New Year's Day was four days ago.\n- Although it was not revealed in Black Impact! The Moment the Black Organization Reaches Out, this case does reveal the location of Kir's motorcycle accident that happened around Toriya City.\n- The release date for the Manga of the latter part of this case was on June 16th, and the anime originally aired part 3 and 4 on February 12 and 19, but that part of this case takes place on February 5th, while the crime about February 3rd.\n"
