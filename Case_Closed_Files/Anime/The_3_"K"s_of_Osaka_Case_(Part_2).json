    "Situation": "Heiji invites Conan, Ran and Kogoro to the opening party of a restaurant owned by three athletes who are famous in America. In Osaka at the K3 Restaurant, Kogoro is very excited to meet Mai Kuraki, Miho Komatsu, TWO-MIX, and his favorite idol, Yoko Okino.\nThe announcer introduces the three athletes: former heavyweight boxing champion Ricardo Barreira, major leaguer Mike Norwood and goalkeeper Ray Curtis, known as the \"Iron Wall of Europe\". Conan is a huge fan of Ray Curtis and is very excited to see him in person. The announcer then asks why they chose Japan to open their restaurant. Ray answers that it's because Japan is like a second home to them. Ray's wife and Mike's wife are both Japanese and Ricardo loves ninjas and samurais. Next, the announcer asks does the \"K\" in the restaurant's name \"K3\" mean \"Kings\". Ray says they are the \"K\"s in \"knockout\", \"strikeout\" and \"goalkeeper\".\nSuddenly, a news reporter named Ed McCay interrupts and says K should stand for \"kitanai\" meaning filth for all the scandals in which they were involved. He doesn't know who invited him but is grateful as he loves sushi. Heiji wonders who he is and Kogoro reveals that Ed McCay is famous in America. He is a reporter whose speciality is reporting on famous athletes' scandals, most of which are fabricated.\nThe announcer asks the audience for questions for the three athletes. Ran steps up but actually asks Ray Curtis for his autograph. The announcer is initially against it, but Ray says that it's okay and also gives one of his number 8 uniforms to her. When Ray asks her name, she actually asks to write 'Shinichi'. Conan blushes because Ran remembered that he was a fan of Ray Curtis.\nKazuha thinks it's weird that goalkeepers are supposed to be number 1 but Ray wears number 8. Conan says it's because Ray used to be a fielder, but during the World Cup, both the first string and back-up goalkeepers were injured, putting them in a pinch, as a result they decided to make Ray the goalkeeper. His super-saves led them to victory. After that, he continued as goalkeeper with the number 8 on his uniform. Kazuha then asks what does number 99 mean on the uniform Mike wears. Heiji answers that it stands for his 99 mph pitching. Lastly, Kazuha asks what does the number 4 mean on the boxing glove under Ricardo's signature. Kogoro answers that it's because Ricardo used to always win in four rounds.\nWhen Ran gets back with the autographed uniform for Shinichi, she also has a ticket to the exhibition match at Nagai Stadium that Ray will be playing in. She decides to give it to Conan much to his delight. Ray also asked Ran to help him with a secret project and gave her a wireless transceiver.\nOutside, Ran uses the transceiver to communicate with the three athletes, who go to the hotel rooms above the restaurant to form a giant letter \"K\" with the lights from the hotel's rooms. When the \"K\" is finally finished, a gunshot goes off and one of the windows breaks. Conan and Heiji run back inside inside the hotel and then upstairs to where the gunshot was heard. They enter a room and after turning on the lights, they find the dead body of Ed McCay.\n\nOtaki and the police arrive. The cause of death is a gunshot wound to the chest. The weapon is determined to be a Smith & Wesson revolver. Judging from the blood stains, death wasn't instant. Heiji states that the gunshot was heard at 8:05 pm. In the hotel while making the giant \"K\", Ray was responsible for the 1st and 2nd floors, Mike was responsible for the 3rd and 4th floors, and Ricardo was responsible for the 5th floor. The crime scene is on the 2nd floor. That means any one of those three could have committed the crime. Judging from the past the three athletes had with Ed McCay, they all undoubtedly had motives to kill him.\nWhen Conan checks the corpse, he notices the victim is gripping his belt with his left hand. While the fingers of his right hand are peculiar as well: The little finger and ring finger are curled in. Conan realizes that this is most likely a dying message that McCay left behind with the last of his strength. Otaki calls the belt a \"band\", which Heiji remarks is a term only middle-aged people use.\nWhen the police check all the guests for traces of gunpowder, all the tests come back negative. They also give the three athletes a simple body check but their managers prevented any further checks. Otaki and Heiji discuss the three athletes' motives: Ricardo was suspected of match fixing and was forced to retire, Ray was exiled from European soccer for suspected drug use, and Mike got divorced due to an affair scandal. All were proven to be fabricated in court. Conan is acting strangely as the three celebrities are suspects, but he isn't sharp as he usually is. Heiji wonders if something is holding him back.\nHeiji checks the rooms and keeps thinking of possible ways that the murder could have taken place.\nConan suddenly appears and talks to him about all three athletes and how they are all innocent. Heiji and Conan open a closet and find a mop inside, they both realize what the trick is. However, Conan who is in disbelief raises his voice at Heiji stating that he will prove that the murder was committed by someone else. Conan leaves and finds the three athletes leaving the restroom all together. He overhears them talking while one of them is supporting Ray Curtis who is limping. Conan goes into the restroom and finds an air pump needle in the trash. He hears Ran, Kazuha, and Kogoro walking over, Kogoro is talking to Ran and Kazuha about what he had overheard in the restaurant. He heard one of the employees saying that they understand what \"bandou\" means. Kogoro also said that Ed McCay was fluent in Japanese and knew a lot about Japanese food. Hearing this, Conan puts two and two together realizing who the culprit is, much to his anger and disbelief.\n",

    "Resolution": "The culprit is Ray Curtis. Instead of performing the deduction in front of everyone, Conan has Heiji call him out to the crime scene alone because he wants to confront Ray by himself, claiming that \"his greatest fan\" is waiting for him.\n- Ray set up a mechanism at the rightmost bottom room in advance with a mop and a closet's door. By kicking a ball from the top of the stairs on the same floor as the room McCay was in to knock away the mop, Ray was able to turn on the lights and shoot McCay within three seconds. Allowing him to create an alibi for himself at the time of murder.\n- In order to murder McCay in such a small time frame, Ray first turned on all the lights in the four rooms on the floors he was managing and knocked on the door of McCay's room. After utilizing the trick above and having Ran confirm his alibi, he rushed to the room McCay was in and killed him, and immediately ran downstairs to the rightmost bottom room to make everyone think that he was there all along. Because of that, the police wouldn't suspect him to be the murderer as he didn't have enough time to \"run to the victim's room after turning on the lights, shoot and kill McCay, and rush back to the rightmost bottom room\". Because McCay’s room was on the second floor, neither Ricardo or Mike were capable of committing the crime without Ray noticing, making Ray himself the only possible suspect capable of committing the murder.\n- Knowing that the police would check for gunpowder residue around his sleeves and pants, Ray took off his jacket before the murder and wore his clothes inside out. After shooting McCay, he put his jacket back on before showing his face to the crowd and used the remaining time before the police arrived to flip his clothes inside out, and washed away any remaining gunpowder on his hands and face. He also disposed of the ball by removing the air via the air needle pump and hid it in his shirt, then among the souvenirs on the table at the party.\n- McCay’s dying message refers to the sushi shop's jargon: his right hand referred to the way people eat sushi, while his left hand on his belt points to \"bando\". The staff at sushi restaurants use 'codes' to mean specific numbers. \"Bando\" refers to the number 8, same as Ray's shirt number.\n- The conclusive piece of evidence is the gunpowder on his shoes after firing the revolver. Although the clothes he wore have been washed, the same cannot be said for his shoes. Ray had to be wearing shoes for the ball trick and didn't wash his shoes after the crime. Once the police discover the gunpowder residue on them, it will prove without a doubt that he is the murderer.\nHearing Conan's deduction, Ray decides to go clean his shoes to \"remove the last piece of evidence connecting him to the crime\", but is stopped by Conan who kicks a soccer ball at him via super kick shoes. However Ray is unable to catch his ball because drug use caused joint pain. Conan concludes McCay's articles were true. However, Ray corrects his claim and reveals that he started using after the case was settled in the court.\nRay's motive for committing the crime was for revenge, as McCay's article which falsely accused him of being a drug addict caused his wife to commit suicide. In order to lure McCay out, Ray used drugs for real, but ultimately, it was also a way for him to cope with the pain of losing his wife. Conan, though saddened by his hero's revelation, confronts and comforts him that even though he is facing the darkest time of his life, drugs and murder is foul play no matter the excuse. He deserves a red card for being a loser. Realizing the error of his ways, Ray claims that it's time for him to leave the field, he must be ejected, for both his beloved wife and his beloved fan, and goes to the police to turn himself in.\n",
