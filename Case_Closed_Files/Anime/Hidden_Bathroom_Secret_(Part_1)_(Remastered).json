    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "This episode reveals bits and pieces of Haibara's family. Haibara knows very little about her parents, and considers her mother a cold and mysterious woman, nicknamed \"Hell Angel\" by the Black Organization. Professor Agasa then brought Conan and her to the house of her father's old friend in Kōenji, who is professor Miyano's friend. Haibara takes an interest in seeing the house, where her father grew up. They learn that Professor Miyano once came here with his wife Elena and their daughter Akemi. Professor Miyano wanted to discuss something with Dejima, but he wasn't home. The family waited for a while, but left. Later, after leaving the bathroom, professor Dejima is murdered, leading Haibara to believe the Black Organization is behind it.\n\n",
    "People": "- Victim (poison)\n- 54 years old\n- Design office president\n- Atsushi Miyano's childhood friend\n- 41 years old\n- Designer\n- 52 years old\n- Designer\n- 35 years old\n- Designer\n",
    "Resolution": "When it was brought up that Zaitsu could be poisoned as he used the restroom last, it is reasoned that Imai knew his colleague would only urinate as there was hardly a sound of water being flushed (there was a water shortage in the building due to supposed tampering from the Black Organization) and the fact that he noticed him drinking a lot. The bag used to contain the poison was retrieved from the dirtiest part of the building's sink.\nImai confesses saying that twenty years ago he desired to work independently from Dejima and start afresh in a new company. Dejima colluded with his rival design companies to deny helping him achieve his dream, causing him to plan to murder his boss. Only the presence of the young Akemi Miyano, who Imai saw as his conscience, stopped him once she saw him seriously looking at the sink. He told her that he was just tired, and Akemi believed it.\nHer pranks to hide design objects in the house was to give Imai rest. However, his vengeance resurfaced again when he decided to become independent, but was told by Dejima that \"it wouldn't have worked out, unless it was him from 20 years ago\". Akemi's short visit, as well as her promise to return with Shiho, would've sooth him of his revenge. Tragically, Imai went through with his vengeance as Akemi never returned, due to her untimely demise at the hands of Gin.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- Atsushi Miyano wasn't shown in any flashback in the original manga version, where his true appearance remains unknown until file 1011.\n- There is a scene where Haibara visualise a shadow figure who ressembles Dr. Araide turning into Vermouth. While in the manga there is only a panel of her thinking about Vermouth.\n",
    "Remastered version": "On May 25 and on June 1, 2013, a remastered version of the case was aired.\n",
    "Trivia": "- When Haibara had that memory of Conan giving her his glasses in order to disguise herself, it was in reference to Reunion with the Black Organization, although the deceased Pisco did recognize her anyway.\n- The bus backflash was from The Mysterious Passenger.\n- When Ran was making egg porridge for Haibara, and admitted, \"It isn't as good as Tarugatei's though\", she is referring to the famous restaurant in the Department store in The Four Porsches, where Conan and Agasa were in line, but after a TV reporter interviewed Conan on LIVE TV, they had to quickly leave, before ordering any for them or for Haibara, which was the goal.\n",
