    "Situation": "While humming the song \"Nazo\", Ayumi jogs toward school, but as she passes by the Makabe residence, she sees a man carrying a woman. Both people look injured, and Ayumi, peeking through the bushes, believes the man killed the woman. Ayumi suspects that Jun Makabe is having an affair with a foreign looking woman, evidence from their rather affectionate hug and kiss on the cheek, and they plan to finish off Yuri in the mountain.\n\nConan, Haibara, and the Detective Boys decided to infiltrate Makabe's residence to find the evidence. True indeed, Ayumi discovers blood splash under the bed. Panic, Ayumi hit her head on the bed and fell unconscious, falling into Jun Makabe's hand.\n\nJun puts Ayumi in a car and drives her to a mountain. Conan chases after him with his stakeboard, and after confrontation, he knocks Jun out with his soccer kick. It seems Conan captured the culprit, but was there something amiss?\n",

    "Resolution": "When Jun brought Ayumi into the mountains, he was really taking her to his wife's hospital for treatment and recovery. In addition, the mysterious woman was not, as the Detective Boys surmised, Jun's mistress, but his younger sister, who was likewise worried about her sister-in-law.\n",
