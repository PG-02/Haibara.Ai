    "Situation": "A package consisting of a smartphone and a print proof of a book entitled Grandpa Tick Tock and the Three Clocks by Kenichi Imai was deivered to the Mouri Detective Agency. Meanwhile, an explosion on a pachinko named Sandcastle happened on a gloomy weather.\n\nThe connecion of the seemingly unrelated explosion and the delivery was revealed to be related after a call on that smartphone mocked Kogoro and hints again on another bomb at a certain block in Haido City. The book has a riddle that is related to the case: on a bus station, five people are waiting. A bus with three passengers arrived. Two passengers get off the bus at the next stop while a passenger rode the bus. How many are the people on the bus when it arrived at its destination?\nKogoro then called Megure about the issue, and Kogoro, Ran, and Conan went into the place. Immediately after they arrived, Megure asked the police to find the said bomb and called Takagi, showing a possible suspect: a bomber named Takuji Hirukawa. Then, Chiba, with the publisher named Hiroyuki Tomonaga, checked the book which was stolen and narrated what happened. The author of the book, Kenichi Imai tried to enter a book contest when a rumor about his half-brother, identified as Takuji, was posted to the internet causing him to withdraw the contest. After his death, Hiroyuki have tried to publish the book, however the print proof was retrieved by his half-brother, who attacked him to make the attempt successful.\nThe bomb was found and still incomplete.\n\n\n\n",
    "People": "- Deceased\n- \"Grandpa Tick Tock and the Three Clocks\" book creator\n- Author\n- 38 years old\n- Bomber\n- 45 years old\n- Editor\n- Kenichi's publisher\n- Tokyo City TV announcer\n- Victim (explosion - injured)\n- Megrez Security employee\n- Victim (explosion - injured)\n- Megrez Security employee\n- Tokyo MPD police officer\n",
    "Resolution": "\nHiroyuki Tomonaga attempted to flee with the remaining stolen money but was caught by Conan (via Kogoro). He was caught red-handed when he blurted that Hirukawa must have been dead, which was not broadcasted on the news. Conan did not understand when Tomonaga, who had forgotten about the solutions to the riddles in the picture book, suddenly started talking about the various illustrations in it. This was when he also realized that the culprit wanted Hirukawa's suicide and the illustration in the book to overlap.  Hirukawa was, however, saved thanks to Kogoro's (Conan's) reasoning and plan to send Takagi and Chiba before the Police to save him, which they successfully accomplished in the nick of time.\nConan started suspecting Tomonaga when he said that the author left the proof for his brother. This was contradictory to the fact that the 'proof' was merely a photocopy, as it does not make sense for a proof to be misaligned. Naturally, Hirukawa would have wanted his brother's original creation but he didn't have it. This only meant that Tomonaga still possessed the proof and had looked it through during the case, but he lied about reading it. All these facts pointed out that Tomonaga was the mastermind.\nWhen asked why he didn't give the original book to Hirukawa, he explained that Hirukawa's brother's work was truly a masterpiece and he couldn't give it to a criminal, despite him being a family member. Then Ran said Tomonaga doesn't have the right to because despite being a copy Tomonaga used that wonderful picture book to commit crimes and the author must be crying in heaven now for what Tomonaga did.\n",
    "Trivia": "- It is an anime transposition of The Real Escape Game's story for Detective Conan attraction \"Escape From Scotland Yard\".\n- Megrez Security's van is a 2014 white Toyota HiAce [H200].\n- Hiroyuki Tomonaga's car is a 1997 metallic grey silver Toyota Caldina GT−T Active Sports [T210G].\n- The car Kogoro sleeps on is a 1991 silver stone metallic Ẽfini MS-6 [GE].\n"
