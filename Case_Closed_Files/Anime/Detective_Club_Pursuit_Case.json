    "Situation": "Conan is chasing the robber with the skateboard. While chasing, Conan contacts the Detective Boys with their badges to get ready to trap the robber. When the robber is trapped, Conan kicks the can to knock the robber into the trap successfully capturing him. The police thank them for their great help and are awarded for their efforts. A sinister shadow reads the newspaper about Conan and the kids latest triumph and smiles menacingly.\nAfter Conan, Ran, Kogoro, Ayumi, Mitsuhiko, and Genta have finished eating at the restaurant Kogoro has treated them to. They are seen walking down a narrow alley discussing a case, when Conan notices a red sportscar coming up from behind them. They prepare to move to the side, but suddenly the driver accelerates, clipping Ayumi and then bailing.\n\nShocked and outraged, Ran tends to Ayumi while Kogoro leaves to call the police and an ambulance; and Conan, Mitsuhiko, and Genta take up pursuit of the culprit on Conan's skateboard.\nAs they rush after the driver, Conan notices to his confusion that the car constantly keeps stopping, then accelerating away as they come near it, as if the culprit deliberately wants them to stay on his tail. They briefly lose their quarry near a closed-down sheet metal factory labelled Ishikura Industries, which sports a huge puddle and a lot of tire tracks at its rear entrances. As they begin to lose hope, the car suddenly reappears in the street before them before taking off once more. But the greatest puzzle in this case is yet to come: The car suddenly stops on a public street, causing Conan and company to bump right into its tail, and then the driver gets out, goes to a nearby police box, and turns himself in.\nLater, at the Beika Hospital, the Detective Boys believe that the driver had allegedly panicked after having hit Ayumi and that his conscience finally convinced him to turn himself in, but Conan is not so sure that it is that simple. Fortunately, Ayumi was not seriously injured, but she lost her Detective Boys Badge in the accident, which is now nowhere to be found. When Conan promises to get her a new one from Professor Agasa, he earns himself Ayumi's gratitude and Mitsuhiko and Genta's jealous stares. But then Kogoro approaches, informing them that in the very same factory the boys had passed by during the pursuit, a murder has taken place.\n\nAt the factory, Kogoro meets with Megure and Takagi, who inform him that the victim is the factory's manager, Hisashi Ishikura, who came to his closed facility for a check-up and apparently encountered a burglar in the process, which happened about an hour ago, at the same time the Detective Boys had passed the place.\nConan however, notices immediately that Ishikura had been tied up with duct tape at or just before the time of his death, but the tape had been removed, and that the external entrance to his office, which opens to the building's back, is in plain sight of a tobacco stand run by an elderly woman. Furthermore, Genta and Mitsuhiko find a photo on Ishikura's desk which depicts a number of people who were arranged for a group shot, among them the hit-and-runner they had chased.\nAt the Beika Police Station, the hit-and-runner, a man by the name of Kenichi Shishido and an employee of Ishikura's until a month ago, claims that after hitting Ayumi, he had passed by the factory by mere coincidence, and the police likewise dismiss him as a suspect, as committing a hit and run, not to mention his voluntary surrender to the police, seems atypical for a murderer's behavior. Further confounding is the tobacco saleslady's statement that nobody had ever entered from the rear, and the Detective Boy's testimony about having covered the front entrance of the factory, which apparently rules him out for the crime. Not convinced, and determined to find more evidence, Conan returns to the crime scene, with Mitsuhiko and Genta in tow. But then Conan stumbles upon several clues which shed a new light upon that case, and with the help of his Voice-Changing Bowtie he arranges a meeting with Kogoro, Megure, Takagi, and Shishido at the factory.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (stabbed)\n- 50 years old\n- Ishikura Industries president\n- 35 years old\n- Ishikura Industries former employee\n- Tobacco store worker\n- Robber\n- Student\n- Tokyo MPD Police officer\n",
    "Resolution": "The evidence for Shishido's crime rests in the following facts. He had prepared a car identical to his own, with which he eventually committed the hit-and-run on Ayumi with. He first incapacitated Ishikura, then, after having lured the Detective Boys to the factory, he hid the fake car in its empty warehouse, used his cellphone to call the tobacco saleswoman under the pretense of having dialed a wrong number, and made use of this diversion to get back into the office while her back was turned, and commit his deed. After diverting the saleswoman's attention with another call, he rushed to his own car parked in a recessed parking lot and came back into the open in order to let the boys see him again.\nThe list of evidence goes as follows:\n- Since the Detective Boys had not seen Shishiro out front, he should have driven his car through the factory grounds and thus through the puddle at the backside. Ergo, if the car he drove to the police box was the one he hit Ayumi with, it should have mud splashes on its body. But it doesn't, whereas the fake car hidden in the warehouse clearly sports them.\n- During the accident, Ayumi's missing Detective Badge got stuck in between the fake car's body and bumper, as Conan demonstrates by having Mitsuhiko call Ayumi’s detective badge.\nConan comments how he had tried to use the detective boys to get away with murder, instead it backfired because he had underestimated them. Faced with the overwhelming evidence, Shishiro breaks down at the fear of spending a long prison term.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Shishido car is a modified deep maroon 1976 Toyota Corolla SR5 Hardtop Coupe. The license plate number is 新宿 33, な 33-96 (Shinjuju 33, Na 33-96).\n- By this episode, the Detective Boys have solved 50 cases already.\n",
