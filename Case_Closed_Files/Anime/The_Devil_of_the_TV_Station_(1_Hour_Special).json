    "Situation": "Yoko takes the Detective Boys and Professor Agasa to a TV studio for a tour, though they're a bit disappointed when they can't go to the Kamen Yaiba studio. When they run into Satan Onizuka, the vocalist for a visual kei rock band who's there for a TV show, they're scared at first and pass him up. However, they decide to search for his room to get his autograph anyway since Mitsuhiko recalls that his older sister Asami is a huge fangirl of Satan's band.\nIn his room, Satan speaks to his manager and asks him for some food from three specific restaurants and a mirror to replace the broken one in the room itself. They also talk about a huge fight between Satan and the president of his production company, Tenji Urushihara, and Satan says he'll need the mirror soon to take off his make up, since he needs to catch a nap due to his lack of sleep after the scuffle.\nIn the meantime, the children and Professor Agasa look for Satan's dressing room. A little later, a Satan without make-up and with a raincoat over his clothes meets with Urushihara and, after a chat, stabs him to death with a knife.\n\nFew later, the Detective Boys find Satan Onizuka's room and meet Satan who is somehow back in full make up, who forgives them for the impasse and gives them an autograph. Ayumi notes some origami birds on Satan's table and is delighted, with Satan even teasing the kids a little about it. Soon after, however, Urushihara's corpse is found by an employee and the police arrive at the station.\nThe police suspect the murderer to be Satan, due to his recent fight with the victim. Satan retorts that, with his make up and costume, it would have been impossible to leave his room without being noticed. Since there is still no mirror in Satan's dressing room, it would be impossible to put on his make up and they cannot charge him with the murder. Conan still suspects Satan as the murderer, and he decides to find out how did he pull such a difficult trick.\n",

    "Resolution": "To prove this, Conan reveals through Professor Agasa that the origami cranes, which he supposedly made to ease his boredom, were used to camouflage the origami paper, plus he used the ruler both for the origami and for the \"mirror\", but the evidence suggested it was not made on that day. Additionally, the clean-faced Satan was easily able to disguise himself as a delivery boy, using a DB outfit that he brought and kept in a bag for comic sketches that he was supposed to do in the show: he also put on the raincoat right before killing Urushihara. Few people lifted an eyebrow at the sight of a man in restaurant delivery clothes in the studio. That's why he asked for food from three different places, so his manager would mention it and then inadvertedly trick people for his sake.\nSatan more or less admits that he's the killer and explains his motive. He reveals that three years ago he was in a very low point of both his life and career, having almost lost his voice due to a throat injury and needing to spend months in an hospital for treatment. A teenage fangirl of his comforted him through letters and gifts that always included tiny origami cranes, but at some point the letters from the girl stopped coming, and initially he didn't really think much of it since he believed she had changed interests. Satan reveals that he found out the exact reason why she stopped writing just one month ago, during a bar meeting with Urushihara: behind his back, his boss impersonated him and posted some creepy messages on the band's official website, asking his fans for a \"blood sacrifice\" as a publicity stunt. Urushihara added that the young fangirl's last letter, implied to not have been given to Satan himself, included a message about \"giving you [Satan Onizuka] my blood\", meaning that the girl had killed herself in what she thought was a sacrifice in the name of her beloved Satan Onizuka. After this meeting with Urushihara, Satan located the girl's family and spoke to her grieving mother, who confirmed that the girl had commited suicide three years ago, apparently for no reason.\nThe cruel discovery of the girl's death sent Satan into both an horrible depression and a massive creative slump, since even when he told jokes about death, murder and the Devil in his public persona, he would've never actually told his fans to harm themselves or commit suicide. He concludes by saying that, in the present, he wanted to retire due to his fame waning and his inspiration leaving him, so he and his band agreed to perform in one last farewell concert, but Urushihara cruelly cancelled it and threatened Satan himself with a huge lawsuit if he insisted on retirement. Then Satan officially confesses to the crime and refers to Urushihara as the real Devil.\nAs one last confession, when Satan Onizuka begins to cry over having let his suicidal fangirl down and not being able to create music anymore, the tears coming from his right eye are lightly tainted with blood. Conan and Ai say that this is because Satan uses contact lenses, and when he killed Urushihara, he was unknowingly stained with the victim's blood beneath one of his eyes. Conan says that Satan did not realize this until it was too late as he had already applied his make up.\nSatan surrenders himself to the police quietly, and Ai and Conan comment on how when the Devil sheds tears, he loses his powers.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- The anime version starts at night with Satan Onizuka in his beautiful penthouse, being told by Urushihara through the phone that his performance is canceled. Satan tries to object but it told that if he insists, he'll be sued. When Urushihara hangs up, an extremely angry Onizuka unsheaths a knife (the one used in the murder itself) and then throws it to the nearest wall.\n- The manga version has Satan Onizuka's real face shown during his last talk with Urushihara. The anime, on the other hand, goes through quite the lengths to not show it clearly until the very end of the episode: first, it chooses to show his eyes and back in the above mentioned opening scene, and then focuses on his torso and hands during the pre-murder talk. And when there's a close-up to Satan's face right before he kills Urushihara, only his eyes are clearly seen.\n- The manga version of the story takes place within the Clash of Red and Black storyline (between Hades and Coma) and has a scene with Conan and Haibara debating on the relation between Hidemi and Eisuke Hondou. The anime version, taking place before the storyline, replaces the scene with the Detective Boys introducing themselves to Waka Inoue and Azusa Yamamoto and interacting with them and Yoko.\n- The anime includes an additional scene that has Kogoro, Ran, and Conan watching the TV show recorded by Yoko, Waka and Azusa. Hilariously, Yoko loses the game show when she incorrectly answers the last question about Ranpo Edogawa and the answer she gave which was Kogoro Mouri mistaking his name for detective Kogoro Akechi.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The character Satan Onizuka and his stage persona is very similar to that of real life musician Demon Kogure, vocalist of the heavy metal band Seikima-II.\n- Satan Onizuka was voiced in the anime by the late actor, comedian and singer Yasuo Saitou, better known by his stage name Yakkun Sakurazuka.\n- There is an animation error roughly 17-18 minutes in, where when Inamori is just starting to reach into the bag for the mirror, Satan Onizuka's body has a space between him and the frame, thus showing the background between his waist and the bottom edge.\n- This case had a unique opening, which is the same song as the last case, however all of the opening animation for this case dealt exclusively with Professor Agasa, Haibara, Detective Boys, Conan, and those they will probably encounter in this case only. Like the opening animation for the song, the closing song animation is unique to this one case, with the same closing song as in the last case.\n- The three different things Satan ordered for delivery are ramen from Tenpuku-tei, fried rice from Jan Jan Ken, and some gyoza from Eirinan, which appear to be three different fictional Chinese restaurants.\n"
