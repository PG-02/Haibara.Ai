    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "He (victim) was meeting the suspect, he was killed when he was apologizing to the culprit.\n\nIt started when Kogoro, Ran, and Conan are going to Nagano to learn history, and the strategy called woodpecker strategy, like the woodpecker pecks wood. Detective Uehara, Inspectors Yamato and Morofushi. After that, there are three policemen are going to Nagano, one of the detectives said, \"We're on our way to the hideout of a wanted robber\". And he say that we do not waste time. The policemen named, Saegusa Mamoru, Akiyama Shinsuke, Takeda Shigeru and Kano Shoji. After that they realize that their squad leader is missing named Takeda, they were supposed to meet there at Nagano, but he didn't show up, Yamato said that he choose the wrong place. And then, they found the body of Takeda Shigeru is in the river, having his throat slit and was decapitated. Conan said that the culprit probably put the head into a plastic bag and a fake blood and it will fall after a short time. And they found the sign of the woodpecker called Bishamonten, and they found a letter X on the head. Yamato said it was no ordinary X, or look like a woodpecker's foot. And then they meet Hyoue Kuroda, the superintendent. Conan was shocked when he see him. Haibara said that \"Rum\" was losing his one eye. Either could be effeminate man, a long-haired man or an old man.\nThe three policemen thought that they would meet at Hachiman Shrine. And then they heard a body who was found at the river. Uehara Yui said that it was called \"Wooodpecker Society\". Apparently in Nagano, there's a group named \"Woodpecker Society\".\nMorofushi said that the case Takeda killed two suspects stood out. The case was happening nine years ago.\nThe police reflect on two cases involving the murdered Takeda, who was well known for his excessive method against the suspects of various cases.\nThe story was a man on drugs was shooting a gun in the city, and the second happened 6 months ago, a man was holed up inside a bank with hostages. Takeda shot the two suspects in the head, splattering blood all over the suspect. And the suspect was a grandmother who was 80-year-old, and they say that she could never commit the crime.\n\n\n\nAnother case happened, Liutenant Kano Shoji was found hanged at a house. Their suspect was Kansuke Yamato who had gone missing. And then, message was found on Yamato's cellphone from Kano Shoji, typing \"I am Bishamonten. The God of War who will destroy the woodpecker\". Morofushi said that the cause of death was strangulation, said that he died half an hour ago. Kano's cellphone had a message saying \"Only three woodpeckers remain.\" And the head of the body has the woodpeckers foot or X. Morofushi said that \"there's a witness claiming they saw you at the bridge.\" Yamato said that he never been there. Morofushi suspect Yamato of killing two victims.\nAfter they were investigating, the killer messaged Saegusa's phone to go in the mountains to reveal who's the killer of killing of these two victims. They were supossed to meet at the cottage where the wanted robber's hideout. And the second case happened.\n\nAfter a while, Akiyama was found tied in car trunk shouting \"My phone, my phone!!!\". The car fell and he was decapitated in front of Yui, Morofushi, Saegusa and Kuroda. They think Yamato is the one who did the serial killing, as Bishamonten. So their boss Kuroda Hyoue told them that ti put BOLO on Yamato.\n\nSaegusa's cellphone had a message on it that they will meet at the cottage, and then Saegusa was knocked down by a taser.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (shocked - injured)\n- 37 years old\n- Nagano Police Inspector\n- Victim (decapitated)\n- 26 years old\n- Nagano Police Sergeant\n- Victim (hanged)\n- 45 years old\n- Nagano Police Assistant Inspector\n- Victim (throat slit)\n- Nagano Police Squad Leader\n- 50 years old\n- Nagano Police First Division Chief\n- Nagano Prefectural Police CSI officer\n",
    "Resolution": "\n- Deceased (gunshot)\n- Shinsuke's younger sister\n- Middle school student\nThe Takeda Squad was not accidentally formed by individuals who bore names similar to some of the famous generals of Takeda Shingen. In fact, as Conan, Inspectors Yamato and Morufushi have found out, the Takeda Squad formed the notorious Woodpecker Society; the \"X\" imprint left on the victims' bodies pointed to the letter X being the 24th letter of the Western alphabet, corresponding to Takeda Shingen's 24 Generals. In order to complete this inner circle, they were looking for new members; hence they also attempted to recruit Inspector Yamato, whose name as akin to Shingen's general Yamamoto Kansuke. The reason why Detective Akiyama targeted the Takeda Squad for extermination was that the Squad/Society members seized and sold confiscated guns to criminal elements in order to line their pockets, and it was one of these guns which killed Tsuyako. Detective Akiyama targeted Inspector Yamato because it was his drug-addicted friend who fired the fatal shot.\nYamato, who had been hiding in a car, knows already that Akiyama Shinsuke is already the killer. And Akiyama, knows that Yamato has been hiding at the trunk of the car. Akiyama tasered Saegusa when he got the message. But then after, Akiyama decided to kill Yamato in the car.\n\n",

    "Manga to anime changes": "- Due to tighter censorship, all the scenes featuring Shigeru Takeda's decapitated head were changed to avoid showing his decapitated wound graphically, similar to Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion.\n- Inspector Yamamura, Heiji Hattori, and Kazuha Toyama don't appear at the beginning of the anime version.\n",
