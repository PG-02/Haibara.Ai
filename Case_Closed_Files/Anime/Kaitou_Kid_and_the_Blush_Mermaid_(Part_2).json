    "Situation": "The Blush Mermaid goes on display at the Suzuki Museum, stuck on the shell of a turtle swimming inside a water tank. Kaitou Kid has announced that he will steal the jewel.\n",
    "People": "",
    "Resolution": "Conan askes for Kogoro's lighter and asks him to drop into the tank, from right above, behind the plate. Kogoro notices that it didn't fall. It's stuck to the plate. According to Sera, the plate is strongly magnetized. Nakamori points out the turtle and jewels wouldn't be attracted to the magnet.\nAccording to Conan: If the diamonds that were around the belly of the turtle were synthetic diamonds. they could have metallic inclusions.\nIn water, magnetism alone could not hold the turtle in place.\nKogoro sees that the plate has been covered in glue. Nakamori wonders how Kid lured the turtle to the plate.\nConan said that Kid used bait with iron dust. The turtle has an acute sense of smell.\nThe device that was used to spread the bait came from the chandelier. It was set in motion when the carpet covered up the tank. The length of the turtle is around 10cm and a plate with a large size could easily hide the turtle behind it.\nNakamori wonders why the turtle wasn't still behind the plate. Conan as Sonoko's voice then explains that there is someone who didn't have a body inspection: Jirokichi. Nakamori inspects the inside of Jirokichi's jacket which turn out to be true. Jirokichi then tells Nakamori that he has an explanation why he hid the turtle. Conan as Sonoko's voice then tells that it is the card that Kid send him after the heist with the true text:\n\"I can't imagine that a turtle covered in synthetic diamonds that got stuck to a magnet is carrying the Blush Mermaid and the name of the turtle is Poseidon, like the sea god from Greek myths. But the owner who was a Italian actress should have named the turtle Neptune after the sea god of the roman myths. If you don't want it known that you spent a small fortune buying a dubious jeweled turtle, then it would be wise if you remove it discretely.\"\nSo Kid knew the Blush Mermaid was a fake, and used magnets for his trick.\nThis explains why Jirokichi was constantly telling them to wrap things up. Kogoro then ask Sonoko what has happened to Kaito Kid. Conan as Sonoko speculates that Kid did everything as a member of the crowd around the entrance.\n",
