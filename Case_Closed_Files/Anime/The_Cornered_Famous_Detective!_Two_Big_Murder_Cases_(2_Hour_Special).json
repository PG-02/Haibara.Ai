    "Case 1:": "",
    "Situation": "Yukiko and Conan arrived in Gunma to meet her childhood friend, Hiromi Yabuuchi. After that, Hiromi introduces her uncle to Yukiko. Also, Hiromi's uncle has a friend named Carlos from Brazil. However, she has noticed some odd behaviors from her uncle, and since Yukiko also knows the old man from her and Hiromi's childhood times, Hiromi summoned her old friend to see if she can help.\nWith Yukiko calling Conan her second son to her friends outside the city, Conan must play along and act like he is a genius thanks to detective books. When a murder takes place and he can't figure out the answer, Conan must figure out if his mom will be safe or if she could be the next target.\n\n\nWith all the clues seemingly disappearing, Conan is forced to realize he has room to grow as a detective and must turn to his father to help him solve the case.\n",

    "Resolution": "The person who set up the crossbow was Keiko Yabuuchi. She tried to scare Yoshifusa into going back to Brazil, because without him, her share of the inheritance would cover up her debts.\nMachiko's aim in killing \"Yoshifusa Yabuuchi\" was to seize his supposed share of inheritance, not knowing that he wasn't the actual heir since up until then none of the potential heirs knew about the real Yoshifusa's death. (Yoshichika did know that his brother had died, but he didn't say anything about it save for signaling it in the tape that contained his until-then secret will.) She went to an urban party and gave a phone call to establish an alibi, then drove back in a car waiting for the opportunity to kill. She told Hiromi Yabuuchi in advance to rekindle the fire heating the rural hot-tub creating an opportunity where Yoshifusa could be isolated. She had the flower in her pocket with the intention to throw suspicious on her husband's former brother-in-law, who had accused the family of murdering his sister. Much to her misfortune, Hickson/Yoshifusa was a very skilled martial artist: when she tried to stab him in the bath, he blocked her attack and then redirected it, stabbing Machiko to death as a consequence.\nThe reason why he did come forward, was because he received two threatening letters. One from Machiko and one from Keiko. He couldn't leave Carlos alone until both threats were eliminated.\nSome of these details are revealed by Shinichi/Conan's father Yusaku, who had followed Yukiko back to Japan and then snuck into the household. Conan himself helps by drugging up Inspector Yamamura and revealing the rest. HIckson accepts his part in Machiko's death and explains his role as Carlos's tutor and bodyguard, then surrenders quietly to the police.\n",
    "Case 2:": "",
    "Continuity": "- This is the second case that show's Ran considering the possibility that Conan is really Shinichi (the first being Once-A-Month Present Threat Case), though she retains suspicion after the end of the case up until The Desperate Revival.[1]\n- Ran identifies Kazumi Sanada as the magician hired to impersonate Kaitou Kid in episode 76 Conan vs. Kaitou Kid, despite the fact she had already been knocked out and replaced by Kid during his introduction.\n",
    "Translation changes": "",
    "Anime": "- The names of the characters in the Funimation Dub are:\n- Nanae Tsukumo - Nina Tathers\n- Motoyasu Tsukumo - Carl Tathers\n- Yuji Momochi - Wymer Mindle\n- Mako Miyoshi (Real name: Mako Kinoshita) - Marvella Asundi (Real name: Marvella Plomthloyd)\n- Ayano Tsukumo - Anya Tathers\n- Yoshiro Kinoshita - Atrimus Plomthloyd\n- Hiromi Yabuuchi - Hiedi Xanderbilt\n- Yoshifusa Yabuuchi - Yorkham Xanderbilt\n- Yoshichika Yabuuchi - Cornelius Xanderbilt\n- Hidekazu Yabuuchi - Herman MacBalm\n- Yoshiyuki Yabuuchi - Olaf Xanderbilt\n- Keiko Yabuuchi - Kari Xanderbilt\n- Machiko Yabuuchi - Marlena Xanderbilt\n- Misao Yamamura - Detective Magnum\n- In the Funimation Dub, the Yabuuchi Family Attorney is named Chauncey Shiflett.\n- The dub also changed Keiko's motive for setting up the timed crossbow. Instead of attempting suicide, Keiko had set it up purposely to 'scare Yoshifusa off'.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is the first episode to be digitally animated. However, the next episodes that will use digital animation will be episode 219, and later on, episode 263. Every other episode will still be animated traditionally until episode 284.\n- A Goemon-buro is a large iron kettle shaped bathtub.\n",
