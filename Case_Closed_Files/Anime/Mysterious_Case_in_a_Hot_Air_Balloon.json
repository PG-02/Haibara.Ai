    "Situation": "As every year, Sonoko goes to the \"Suzuki Balloon Festival\", the largest national hot-air balloon race sponsored by her family at the Ibaraki Prefecture, but this time with Ran and Conan. The three go on Ayato Hasegawa's balloon, the receptionist who must record the video of the competition.\nDuring the race, with a premium of ten million yen for the winner, Akihiro Okuda's balloon clashes with Shingo Mizuguchi's, the reigning champion, and as he cuts on his face, his wife Arisa Mizuguchi falls from the wicker basket and dies on the river bank.\n\nThe police are immediately called. Conan finds out that it was not an accident, so he fells Sonoko asleep and resolved the case.\n",

    "Trivia": "- All balloons are called \"Bell Tree\", like the airship in The Lost Ship in the Sky.\n- The crime scene reappears in a poster in the house from The Glamping Mystery.\n- Sonoko's car is the same from Conan and Ebizo's Kabuki Jūhachiban Mystery, a 2010 pink Bentley Mulsanne. The license plate number is 新宿 300, す 4 04 (Shinjuku 300, Su 4 04), but it was not shown in the previous case it appeared in.\n"
