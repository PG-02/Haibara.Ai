Later, he meets Hajime Tomori, who has come to get the dirty clothes.\nDuring lunch time, a male student afraid that the English teacher will call him during class. His friend then advised that he should get Rei to teach him, as Rei is blond and half, and even bets that he is better than the English teacher. Hearing that, Date gets up from the seat, and grabs the student's shirt before scolding him. Date also takes the toothpick in his mouth and breaks it, as he doesn't like seeing it. After that, he goes back to his seat. Kenji then asks if Date has a crush on Rei. Both Date and Rei are shocked hearing that, before Date can defend himself that he has got a girlfriend. The others become silent for a while, before they went shocked. That night, Date call his girlfriend Natalie, and tells her about the situation during lunch and his days in police academy.

Hiro then decide to go with them too. Matsuda later mentioned that he saw a guy with strange tattoo, which looks like a cup with fancy base. Hearing that, Hiro remembers the culprit who kill his parents, who also have the similar tattoo. Hiro then ask Matsuda more about that person, but Matsuda don't know. He later suggest that they go to the bike shop that night.\nThe next match is between Rei and Date. Matsuda and Kenji are placing bet on who will be the winner. Matsuda bets on Rei, while Kenji bets on Date. Matsuda says that Date's knee is injured, and it will be noticed by Rei. Later, Rei noticed it, and targeted Date's knee, but suddenly stops, and before he realized, he get knocked out by Date. Date then express his disappointment towards Rei, saying that he might be injured in real world if he shows any weakness in front of criminals, ending up with terrible fate as his father suffered. He then walks away, saying \"Unless you are stronger than everyone else, you can't carry out justice.\"\nThat night, Rei is thinking about Date's words, when Hiro, Kenji, and Matsuda ask if Rei need anything to buy as they are heading out. Rei replies that he don't need anything yet, and the group left. Rei then remembers that he almost out of toothpaste, but the group already gone far. With no choice left, he then go outside. He later meet Date in front of police academy.\nOn the way to convenience store, Date tells Rei about his father who was a patrol officer. On that day, young Date went to convenience store with his father. He asked his father why he always chew on toothpicks. His father answered that because he looks skinny and doesn't look reliable, he use toothpicks so that people don't underestimate him. Date later interested in doing the same thing, but his father advised that he should do it with candy on a stick. Later in the store, a man whose clothes covered in someone's blood and wooden sword entered the store and demanded money. Date knew that his father will do something, but instead his father begged the man to take his wallet and spare the others. Date then says that his father is an officer and that he will beat up the man. However, the man then beat his father using the wooden sword. He then stop and left the store when he heard sirens. His father ended up in hospital for a year, and later quit the police force because of his injuries. Date then discovered that the man is a gang member who was searching for getaway money, and apparently cause injuries in another store. Date wished that his father had been strong enough to arrest the man.\n\n\nThey then arrive at the store. However, some robbers later come in with guns and give a warning shot.\n\nMeanwhile, Matsuda, Hiro and Kenji go to the bike shop and ask the worker if he saw the guy with the strange tattoo. However, the worker refused to say anything about customer personal information without a reason. Hiro can't say the reason as he quickly traumatized while remembering the scene. Suddenly, Kenji remembers that he saw Date's father got beaten by the yakuza-looking man.\nBack to the store, the robbers take the customers' phone, but not the money in the register. Rei and Date plans to take them down as they are not being tied yet. However, they were busted by the clerk who is also part of the robbers. Later, the leader and another robber come in. The customer later being locked in the storage room with hand tied and mouth sealed. Rei and Date managed to free themselves using shoelace. Rei deduce that the robbers are aiming the ATM cash resupply with the help of the clerk who know when the resupply will happen. Once they are finished, the robbers might not let the hostage leave alive. Rei then discovers the switchboard, and uses the store sign lamp to send Morse Code.\nWhile walking back to police academy, Matsuda says that he understands Date's feeling after hearing Kenji's story about Date's father.
