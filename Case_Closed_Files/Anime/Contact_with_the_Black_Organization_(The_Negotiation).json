    "Situation": "Ran tells Conan that Shuichi Akai is an FBI agent causing Conan to wonder what the FBI are doing in Japan. Conan heads to Professor Agasa to analyze the data from Suguru Itakura's disk and learn that the Black Organization were going to Itakura's cottage to retrieve the program he was working on. Conan and Professor Agasa head to Itakura's cottage in an attempt to intercept the email the Black Organization would send in order to trace them. However, the email was programmed to be deleted if the correct password was not typed and subsequently causes the Black Organization members to believe Itakura is in the cottage. Vodka phones the house and believing Itakura is in the cottage, to pick up the phone.\nConan uses his voice changing bow tie to impersonate Itakura and is able to learn of the location and time of their planned meeting. As Conan and Professor Agasa head to the disclosed location, a subway construction site in Tokyo, their car breaks down. Luckily they are able to hitch hike with a man and woman driving a BMW. Conan notices that the man is unfamiliar with the car due to the steering wheel being in the left side instead of the usual right side like most Japanese cars. This causes him to begin suspecting the man and women to be hiding something. While passing a police check point, they learn that the jewelry robbers had abandoned their car in that area and may be near by.\nConan and Professor Agasa are riding in the foreign car with two strange people and catches the two people who are robbers.\n",

    "Remastered version": "On December 17, 2007, a remastered version of the case was aired. All three episodes were edited and combined into one hour long special, and scenes were edited out to fit the timeslot.\n",
    "Trivia": "- In this encounter, reading the files from Itakura's diary, Conan only manages to figure out a hint that the organization may be trying to \"raise the dead\".\n- The jewel robbers' car is a 1998 Beige BMW 3 [E46].\n- Vodka's vehicle is a 1970 Dark Green VW-Porsche 914 [Typ 47]. The license plate number is 新宿 54, こ 33-46 (Shinjuku 54, Ko 33-46).\n- This is the case that Agasa gave Conan an extra pair of Homing glasses or Criminal Tracking Glasses, so that Conan will not have to recharge them anymore. This is referring to Mitsuhiko's Mystifying Forest, when they were looking for Mitsuhiko in a Gunma forest, and then found out that a serial killer was in the same forest, and the batteries had died, so the glasses could no longer be used to find the missing boy.\n",
