    "Situation": "A routine afternoon at the library turns into the hunt for a corpse after an attendant turns up missing. When Conan and the Detective Boys try to solve the mystery by staying after-hours, they find themselves trapped, in the dark, and not alone. Will they catch the killer before he catches them?\n\n\n",

    "Resolution": "The books with the drugs had no spine, so Tsugawa hid the books in the kids section creating three rows of books instead of two. As a result the books looked uneven and unaligned due to the one book pushing the other book out to the other side, because of the third additional row of books.\n\n\n",
