After being asked about his drawings of a home, the man realizes he has been drawing unconsciously, and holds his head in pain. In the hospital, he was revealed to have been affected by amnesia and the pain was his returning memories. Later that day, the man runs away from the hospital. The next day while playing baseball, Genta finds the man dead.\n\nUsing the sketch book in the dead man's possession, the Detective Boys are able to locate the house that match the pictures in the sketch book. The four of them traces the sketch trail to a house owned by a woman named Kimie Hayase, who had ordered a cleaning company to clean her entire house. The lady gives the Detective Boys some lemonade while Conan notices that the placement of the funitures in the living room is different from the sketch. The group notice a picture of Kimie's former husband who shares the exact features with the man who was murdered. However, Kimie denies their claim, as her husband had already perished a year ago.\nLater, Conan informs Ran and Kogoro about the case's situation, prompting Kogoro to remember a case about the missing man which happened roughly a year ago.\n\nBecause the deceased Tatsuo has no family left other than his wife, the police ask Kimie to identify the man's body. While agreeing that the man greatly resembles her late husband, she claims that the two are different people. Kimie then criticizes Takagi for smoking his the interrogation room before continues that she loathes her husband for the crime he committed, resulted in her being condemned by the society, and in the attempt to forget him she threw away all of his possessions.
