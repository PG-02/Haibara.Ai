    "Situation": "At night, Hiroshi Yagisawa and his dog Coeur, are taking a walk in Beika Street. Coeur sense something strange so Coeur is showing Yagisawa that she found the dead body in underground passageway.\n\nOn Saturday, Conan, Haibara, and the Detective Boys are having a good time walking along together. Genta is eating grape-flavored candy. Mitsuhiko found the paper in the middle of the street. It's a paper from the Sakae cleaning shop. When Mitsuhiko unfolds the paper, he found a map. Genta thinks it's a treasure map but it's not. Mitsuhiko thinks it's a map of targets for burglary because he remembers that it's been recently been occurring around Beika district. Conan thinks it's ridiculous but Ayumi and Genta think so too. So the Detective Boys are going to follow the map with every X mark locations around the people's houses.\nThe Detective Boys went to the Ohga household and asked the Ohga family about burglary in their home but they felt relief when the Ohga family confirm there's no burglary. Norifumi Ohga is curious if the paper is really the map of targets for burglary and Mitsuhiko thinks the probability is high. Mitsuhiko asked Norifumi is there anything suspicious going on or any strange incidents. Norifumi said no that he didn't see anything suspicious. Conan asked Norifumi does he know any other people's homes and Norifumi doesn't know also. Norifumi's wife, Misako took the map from Norifumi's possession and looked. She thinks it's creepy that why is their house in the map. Until sudden, she scolds at Genta not to step on the grass. Norifumi is about to smoke a cigarette but Misako tells Norifumi not to smoke in front of their child, Tomoya. Conan asks Norifumi what's his job and Norifumi reveals he's an architect.\nNext, the Detective Boys went to visit to the woman named Tamae Eguchi who's smoking a cigarette. Mitsuhiko asks her that if she has any idea about other's homes by showing her the map. Eguchi doesn't know and there's no burglary in her house either. Also she didn't see anything suspicious. Conan asks what's her job and Eguchi reveals that she's an illustrator.\nThe Detective Boys visit to the old lady named Shizuko Fujiki and Mitsuhiko asked the same question like from other people's houses. Same answer from Shizuko and no burglary in her house. Suddenly, Shizuko's son named Koichi Fujiki appears. He got the cigarette box from the shopping bag and puts it in his back pocket. Koichi asked Shizuko what's wrong and Shizuko tells Koichi that the kids found the map of targeting for burglary and shows it to him. The Detective Boys asked him about anything suspicious going on and Koichi doesn't know also. Conan asks what's his job and Koichi reveals he's an office worker.\nThe Detective Boys went to the Kohzuki household according to the map but found the police car right in front of it. They think that someone has already burglarize the Kohzuki household. Conan asked the man that did something happen at the Kohzuki household and the man reveals that Kohzuki died. Around last night at around 10, he was found near Beika Street, at the bottom of the stairs leading to the underground passageway. He was bleeding from his head and lying on the floor. Conan wonders if it's an accident or murder. Conan sees at the front of Kohzuki household that there's water bottles. Suddenly, the police came out of the Kohzuki household and tells the woman to report anything when she notice anything. The woman's name is Sawako. She is Kohzuki's daughter. Mitsuhiko thought about something that if the map isn't just burglary but a case involved with Kohzuki. Ayumi asked Mitsuhiko about what does he mean by that. Mitsuhiko thinks that the one who wrote the map is the culprit and still pursuing the other's homes. The Detective Boys are about to report it to the police about the map but the police are very busy so they just went in the police car and drives away to the crime scene. Conan is about to check the crime scene so he told Haibara and the Detective Boys to wait for him at the library.\nWhen Conan arrives at Beika Street, he heard that the crime scene investigator told the police that Kohzuki's right hand smells like tobacco, but there was no tobacco around him when he's lying on the floor. The police were told by Sawako that he didn't smoke.\nAt outside of the library, the Detective Boys are waiting for Conan. After that, they're about to get some ice cream from the vending machine in the library but Haibara will just stay outside waiting for Conan. When Yagisawa and Coeur appear, Haibara is smiling at Coeur and felt like she wants to see Coeur closer. Suddenly, the culprit steals the map from the table while Haibara isn't looking.\nConan arrives at the library but suddenly the Detective Boys are looking for the missing map after they were inside the library buying ice cream. Conan met Yagisawa and his dog Coeur again. Conan pets Coeur's head by saying, \"Coeur, have you been doing well?\" Haibara asked Conan that does he know Coeur and Yagisawa. Conan knows them alright because thanks to Coeur who helped Conan solved the murder case last time. Mitsuhiko tells Conan that he can't find the missing map. Yagisawa reveals he's the one who made the map with the X marks on it. The map is actually Coeur's walking course that Yagisawa's friend uses when Yagisawa can't walk Coeur. The X marks on houses is to watch out for. She dropped it while walking the dog. The first house was Ohga's house when Misako gets angry so easily. Yagisawa and Coeur got yelled by Misako when Coeur touched the grass. The second house where Eguchi lives, Eguchi sprays pesticide on her roses, so Yagisawa thought it would be best to stay away. Eguchi uses fertilzer so dogs like to get close because they like that smell. Then the third house where Shizuko Fujiki lives is that she likes to keep things neat and clean. She dislikes dog urine. Conan noticed that she sprayed water in front of houses and poles while the Detective Boys are questioning Shizuko. Also for Kohzuki's place, Kohzuki dislikes dog urine too. He was frequently cleaning the front of his house. One time, when Coeur urinate in front of Kohzuki's house. Kohzuki ran after Coeur and Yagisawa with the broom. That's why they are lot of water bottles in front of his house but it's actually cat repellent. It seems Mitsuhiko's theory was wrong all along. About the worthless map, somebody with some purpose stole it. That person that stole the map must be the murderer of Kohzuki. The map that Mitsuhiko found that was mistakenly thought was related to Kohzuki's murder was stolen because the culprit thought it would be bad if the police gets it. Among the homes that Conan, Haibara, and the Detective Boys visited are one of them is the culprit. The key to solving the mystery is tobacco. The one who smoked tobacco are Norifumi Ohga, Tamae Eguchi, and Kohichi Fujiki. Yagisawa mentions about Kohzuki that found the cigarette that has two blue lines on it. After the conversation, Conan and the group are going to gather information around the houses. Conan asked Yagisawa to draw another map and Yagisawa understands.\nAfter the group investigates, they couldn't find the cigarette that was been thrown away. While they are looking to the map, Ohga's architect office is in front of the Beika Station so always walk home. He leaves home at around 7-8 and comes home at varied time so it seems like yesterday was at around 10. Eguchi works four times a week. From evening, she has a part time job at the club. Fujiki also goes home by going to Beika Station. He leaves his house at 7 every morning. All three of them has the possibility of throwing away a cigarette butt in front of Kohzuki's house. When Conan asked the underground passageway guard, as he suspected, it's the same brand of cigarette that's lying on the floor which is the \"blue line\". Last night around 10, one of those three went through the underground passageway, throw away the cigarette butt on the floor, then Kohzuki witnessed it and a quarrel occurred. That's why they weren't any cigarette butts on the floor. Suddenly, Conan just thought of something about the water pathway. Conan and the group are going there.\n",
