    "Situation": "Professor Agasa takes the Detective Boys with him to an onsen (hot spring) to fix a product the Onsen owner purchased from him. At the onsen, the kids are introduced to four cast members filming a drama about a hitman. Since the bath is crowded, the kids decide to bathe in the early morning. As they head to the bath, Haibara and Ayumi discover Ganji Tetsuyama, the scriptwriter, inside the bath's women section, dead.\n\nThe police arrive and conclude that Tetsuyama slipped on a soap bar and hit his head on one of the rocks. Conan reveals it's in fact a murder, and points out that the pools of water on the victim's body reveals that the culprit washed something off and deduces it to be blood. The police assume the culprit waited at the veranda for the victim before committing the murder and begin searching for people entering the sauna without alibis; the suspects are the three other cast members.\nAs the police continue their investigation, they discover a plastic tea bottle filled with water in the dressing room, match cinders floating on the water, and Tetsuyama's silver-gemed ring. It is also revealed that all the suspects have been seen in the hotel after the sauna was closed disproving their previous theory.\n",
    "People": "- 28 years old\n- Actress\n- 34 years old\n- Mishio's manager\n- Victim (fell)\n- 67 years old\n- Scriptwriter\n- 33 years old\n- Actor\n- Hakone hot springs Kobo Inn owner\n- Agasa's client\n- Hakone hot springs Kobo Inn manager\n- Hakone hot springs Kobo Inn employee\n",
    "Resolution": "As evidence towards Tanzawa as the culprit, Conan reveals that he was completely engrossed in pretending to be Tetsuyama that he took the latter's silver ring without noticing - and that the ring was stained by the sulphur in the bath's hot steam, proving that the murder has been committed inside the bath. Also, the fact that he would barge into the women section of the bath, with certain knowledge that there were \"only\" two little girls and no adult woman inside, reveals that he must have known more than he wanted to show.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The onsen from this episode is based on the Jozankei Onsen in Minami Ward, Sapporo, Hokkaido.\n- The suspects' names come from \"hot springs\"[1] :\nMishio Natori (名取 深汐) comes from \"sodium\" (ナトリウム ,natoriumu?) and \"salt\" (塩 ,shio?), which are contained inside hot springs ;\nJunsaku Tanzawa (丹沢 純作) comes from \"Japanese simple-type hot springs\" (単純温泉 ,tanjun onsen?) ;\nGanji Tetsuyama (鉄山 厳治) comes from \"chalybeate\" (含鉄泉 ,gantetsusen?) ;\nUnpei Terado (寺堂 雲平) comes from \"radon\" (ラドン ,radon?), an element present in hot springs.\n- Mishio Natori (名取 深汐) comes from \"sodium\" (ナトリウム ,natoriumu?) and \"salt\" (塩 ,shio?), which are contained inside hot springs ;\n- Junsaku Tanzawa (丹沢 純作) comes from \"Japanese simple-type hot springs\" (単純温泉 ,tanjun onsen?) ;\n- Ganji Tetsuyama (鉄山 厳治) comes from \"chalybeate\" (含鉄泉 ,gantetsusen?) ;\n- Unpei Terado (寺堂 雲平) comes from \"radon\" (ラドン ,radon?), an element present in hot springs.\n- Mishio Natori (名取 深汐) comes from \"sodium\" (ナトリウム ,natoriumu?) and \"salt\" (塩 ,shio?), which are contained inside hot springs ;\n- Junsaku Tanzawa (丹沢 純作) comes from \"Japanese simple-type hot springs\" (単純温泉 ,tanjun onsen?) ;\n- Ganji Tetsuyama (鉄山 厳治) comes from \"chalybeate\" (含鉄泉 ,gantetsusen?) ;\n- Unpei Terado (寺堂 雲平) comes from \"radon\" (ラドン ,radon?), an element present in hot springs.\n",
