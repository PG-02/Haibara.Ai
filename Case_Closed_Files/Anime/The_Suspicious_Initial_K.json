    "Situation": "The security guard named Zenkichi Ooka is threatening two people to keep giving money to him.\nAt night, Conan, Ran, and Kogoro came from the store after they had delicious spring rolls. They found the policeman named Sumio Tateno who's talking to the woman. Tateno works at the Beika 5th district police box. He is diligent, nice, and good with people. Even the neighbors strongly trust him. Soon, he will be transferred to the criminal division. The woman named Toshiko Hanazawa is trying to tell Tateno and Kogoro about that she saw somebody who is always going through the garbage. Suddenly, the woman with the shock expression came out of the house with the little amount of blood on her. She said she found someone's dead inside. Conan, Kogoro, and Tateno went inside and found Zenkichi Ooka dead.\n\nThere's a bloody knife on the floor and the cut marks on Ooka's hands. There's also blood on the cushion with the hole in it. The culprit must've used the cushion and stabbed through it. One more is that Ooka left a dying message, \"K\". The fake tooth in Ooka's mouth is missing. Ooka's cellphone is broken.\nInspector Megure and Detective Takagi had arrived and Officer Tateno reports everything to them. Inspector Megure asks the woman who found the dead body about what her name is and the woman reveals her name, Kiwako Kaitani. It seems that her initial is K. Hanazawa said she saw the whole thing. She was talking to her friend in front of her house. She believes it was at past 6, Ooka came home. Then soon after, a man visited to Ooka's house. Hanazawa thinks it's a 50 year old office worker. He left gloomily after about ten minutes. After twenty minutes, Kaitani came. Hanazawa's friend left and Officer Tateno came. Hanazawa and Tateno were talking for about five minutes and until sudden, that's when Conan, Ran, and Kogoro came. Finally, Kaitani came out of Ooka's house. That's the whole story from Hanazawa. Kaitani thinks the man is the one who's responsible for Ooka's death. Inspector Megure and the police are going to look for the man who's involved with Ooka. Suddenly, Hanazawa found the man that's in the middle of the crowd. The man ran from the crowd until Kogoro and Tateno went after him. They caught the man. Inspector Megure asks the man's name and the man reveals his name, Katsutoshi Kusaka. It seems that his initial is K also.\nAt the police station, Takagi is questioning Kusaka about the knife belonging to him. Kusaka confirms it, but he said he didn't kill Ooka. The reason why he visits to Ooka's house is because he's being blackmailed. It happened seven years ago: Kusaka got addicted to gambling in mahjong. The police started arresting the customers including Kusaka. Ooka was one of the customers also, but luckily got away. After that, Kusaka turned into a new leaf. He began to work diligently. Two years ago, Kusaka met Ooka at the new supermarket ever since he demanded money. That's when the blackmailing starts. Kusaka's daughter got engaged in six months ago. Ever since then, the demand escalated. A few days ago, when Kusaka is having a dinner with the other family at Shiomi Hotel, Ooka appeared. Ooka said he had police work nearby. At that rate, he was going to ruin the marriage. When Kusaka thinks about it, he couldn't take it anymore. Takagi asked Kusaka about today's visit to hand him over money. Kusaka answered that it's usually when he get his paycheck, but Ooka said he was going to a funeral, so he suddenly demanded money for traveling fees. He brought a knife in replace of money. However, when Ooka and Kusaka were struggling, Kusaka cut his hands. When Kusaka saw the blood splatter, he got frightened. He threw the knife away and ran away. That's everything from Kusaka and he thinks Kaitani is the one who killed Ooka when she came to visit Ooka after him.\nNext, Sato is questioning Kaitani about the harmful drugs that weakens the human body which was found in Kaitani's bag. Sato asked Kaitani that she's a pharmacist and steals ingredients from where she works. Kaitani angrily accuses Ooka that it was his fault. Kaitani is graduating this year but couldn't find a career. She became childish and began to shoplift. Ooka caught her and will keep quiet if Kaitani hands over the money. Ever since then, every month, after getting employed, Ooka demanded Kaitani to pay double. He would go where Kaitani works to get drugs. When she thinks about her whole life being blackmailed, she couldn't take it anymore. That's why she wished Ooka would get a serious disease. Sato asked Kaitani about today's visit to hand Ooka over money. Kaitani answered it's usually at the beginning of the month, but Ooka said his friend died so he suddenly demanded Kaitani to pay for the hotel fees. All she did was to break Ooka's cellphone. It had proof that she was shoplifting. She still thinks Kusaka is the one who killed Ooka when he came to visit him before her.\nInspector Megure can't believe the victim was blackmailing Kaitani and Kusaka. According to Kusaka, Ooka was into overseas casino. The blackmailing was to save money and use money for casino spending. Conan asked about the calendar from Ooka's house. Conan sees things written on the calendar and it's some sort of a code. Kogoro tells Tateno that his police cap is dirty. Tateno took his cap off, cleaned it off, and put it back on. Megure asked Tateno that they weren't any suspicious person inside and all the doors and windows were locked from the inside. Tateno confirms it and in other words, only Kaitani and Kusaka were the only ones able to enter and leave. The culprit could be one of those two.\nConan thinks it still doesn't make any sense. Conan asks about the missing fake tooth and Takagi confirms it was still not found at the crime scene. If it came out during the struggle with the culprit, it might be on the culprit. It was not found on Kaitani and Kusaka also. Takagi thinks Kusaka could have thrown away since he was the only one who left the crime scene. Megure orders Takagi and Sato to watch over Kaitani and Kusaka. He also orders Chiba to investigate Ooka's notebook. The notebook might have more blackmailed victims. Conan notices the word, \"Maruoka\" on the notebook. When Conan checks the calendar, he knows what it means. He still wonders what \"K\" means. Until sudden, Conan found some ants on the ground and finally solved the whole mystery.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (stabbed)\n- 64 years old\n- Haido supermarket security guard\n- 27 years old\n- Policeman\n- 49 years old\n- Housewife\n- 25 years old\n- Pharmacist\n- 53 years old\n- Office worker\n- Toshiko's friend\n- Housewife\n- Katsutoshi's wife\n- Katsutoshi's only daughter\n- Kusaka's fiancé\n- Man 1's father\n- Man 1's mother\n- Man 2's wife\n",
    "Resolution": "The culprit is the police officer, Sumio Tateno. The calendar found in the victim's home had unusual markings next to certain dates of each month. The markings showed the victim's visits and when his blackmail money was expected. The codes are a mixture of numbers and letters that he uses to represent words.\nConan figured this out after seeing Ooka's notebook that read \"Maru -oka\". He realized that it was not a circle, but a \"0\" in front of \"oka\" (in Japanese) making it \"Ooka\". Katsutoshi Kusaka is \"9A\". Kusaka can be read as \"kyuu A\" or \"9A\" (in Japanese). Kiwako Kaitani, who was a pharmacist was 89 \"woman\" (in Japanese) because (\"ya-kyuu\") in Japanese sounds like \"pharmacist\" (\"yakuzaishi\") and becomes 89. She is a female so he adds \"woman\". Furthermore, \"403\" or \"yonhyaku san\" sounds like \"yon go san\", referring to Shiomi Hotel. Also, Ooka wrote \"100\" when he went to the pharmacist because it sounds like \"pharmacy\". \"K\" was for \"keikan\", policeman in Japanese.\nConan thought it was strange when the officer said he would look to see if there was anyone around and he went straight to the kitchen rather than checking the room across the hallway. At the time, the officer had gone to lock the back entrance which he came in through to murder Ooka. It is revealed that he was the one looting through the neighborhood garbage while he was getting information on Ooka. This way he was allowed to patrol the area frequently without being seen as suspicious. When Tateno had murdered Ooka, his hat dropped onto the sugar that had spilled during the struggle. Conan noticed Tateno cleaning off sugar from his hat at the police station and saw that he dusted the hat off upside down. Conan knew the substance was sugar because ants had begun to gather around that area. Conan also concluded that Ooka's missing false tooth must have also fallen into Tateno's hat during the struggle. Takagi takes the hat and finds the tooth in his police hat.\nTateno revealed that he was also one of the lucky members that escaped arrest for playing mahjong, as a result he decided to focus on school afterwards. Half a year ago however, Ooka recognized Tateno while working at the supermarket (because the usual guard was sick that day) and started to blackmail him on the 11th of every month. It was revealed that Tateno changed the \"K\" on the calendar to \"mizu\" (Japanese for water) to hide the fact that he was being blackmailed as well. Ooka also increased the payment due when he realized Tateno was trying to get promoted into the crime department as a detective. Once Tateno realized Ooka was blackmailing others as well, he decided to kill in the name of \"justice\". Hearing this angers Conan and Megure, the latter grabs Tateno by the collar and says no matter how good Tateno makes it sound, he committed murder. Megure berates Tateno for ruining the good name of all the police officers in Japan and adding he has no right to talk about justice at all.\n"
