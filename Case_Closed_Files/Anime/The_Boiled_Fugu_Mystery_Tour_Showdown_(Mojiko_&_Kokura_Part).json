    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan visit Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi Prefecture, with the introduction of Hiroki Oi, a lawyer they met in a past case. The client is Makoto Izumiya, the fourth generation owner of a long-established puffer fish restaurant Izumiya, and his daughter Kaede. It is said that, when the store was at its busiest and no one was in the house, a burglar broke in and stole the heirloom pot. It's an expensive hot pot, but what's important to them is the soup stock that comes out of the hot pot's skin, which has been steeped in the umami flavor since the restaurant's founding. Conan and the others go to interview four suspect candidates narrowed down by the police.\n\nThere are four suspects: Yasushi Kobayashi, an employee at a restaurant at Kanmon Wharf who was arrested two years ago for robbing Izumiya restaurant; Shinichi Fujii, the owner of Kan restaurant chain who failed to buy Izumiya; Satoru Daiehara, the owner of King Arthur restaurant who knows about Izumiya's pot; and Keisuke Ban, a former employee at Izumiya who was fired. They start to investigate by going to visit each suspects and ask them questions, while also traveling in different places. At the night, Kogoro, Ran, and Conan visit an izakaya where they start their deductions, but when they exit the Izakaya, the robber is seen and chased by Ran, but before escaping, he attacks Kogoro with a bottle.\n\nThe police examine all of the security camera footage from Kyushu to Honshu on the day of the theft (e.g. Kanmon Tunnel, Mojiko Retro, Shin-Shimonoseki, and Shimonoseki station platforms), and none of the suspects appears in the camera footage. In addition to that all of them have perfect alibis, then what trick did the culprit use?\nDoctor says that Kogoro is fine after all, and he will be fully recovered in two weeks. Kogoro claims that he will proceed his investigation, uttered by Conan using his voice-changing bowtie. Oi phones Conan informing that the coworker who verified Kobayashi's alibi lied, which implies that he no longer has an alibi. Due to the fear of accusation plus he had a criminal record formerly, Kobayashi attempts to run away, heading towards Shin-Shimonoseki station. So, is Kobayashi the true culprit? And how did they cross the Kanmon Channel without appearing within the camera footage?\n",
    "People": "- 58 years old\n- Izumiya restaurant owner\n- 22 years old\n- Makoto's only daughter\n- 27 years old\n- Kanmon Wharf restaurant part-time employee\n- 43 years old\n- Kan restaurant chain company manager\n- 34 years old\n- King Arthur restaurant owner and chef\n- 24 years old\n- Former Izumiya restaurant employee\n- Chofu Mori residence security guard\n- Izakaya manager\n- Izakaya waitress\n- Yasushi's co-worker\n- Kanmon Wharf restaurant employee\n- Shimonoseki City Hospital doctor\n- Hiroki's driver\n",
    "Resolution": "\nIn order to get to Honshu, and implement the crime, the culprit has to go across the Kanmon Channel. And the truth turns out to be that Daiehara swam to the other side of the channel, by wearing a drysuit. A poor swimmer can even accomplish swimming the Antarctic Ocean with the suit's buoyancy and its fins. Conan pointed out that from the photo Daiehara sent to Kogoro for his alibi, he was wearing a dive computer on his wrist rather than a normal watch. This means that Daiehara has a diving license.\nAccording to Daiehara's medical certificate, it has been two months and fifteen days ever since he broke his leg. The recovery period will be three months, however, Conan uses Kogoro as an example, Kogoro is currently on the second day of his two-week recovery, and he is doing totally fine. Therefore, Daiehara's medical certificate may not be a vigorous proof. Oi allows Makoto and Kaede to taste the dish made by Daiehara. Since it is cooked using their heirloom pot, the food must be steeped in the umami flavor, that the Izumiya restaurant owner will recognize. And both of them insisted that the dish was cooked using that pot.\nSeeing the truth being revealed, Daiehara confesses and decides to destroy the pot. Fortunately, Conan successfully saves the pot before reaching the ground.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The famous Mōri Motonari was one of the Mouri family's ancestors, according to The Kanmon Strait of Friendship and Murderous Intent‎; Chofu Mori Residence appears in this episode.\n- Kogoro's gold business card reappears in the first part.\n",
