    "Situation": "Ran, Sonoko, and Masumi follow Conan as he leads them to an alternate route. It seems Conan wanted Ran to see the Cherry Blossoms. A petal falls on Conan's nose. Ran picks it up and reminisces the first time she met Shinichi. She wonders if Shinichi knows that she hated him the first time she met him.\nThis part emphasises on Ran's perception of the story.\nThirteen years ago, Eri is still married to Kogoro. It is Kogoro's first day at the headquarters and she is searching for Ran's Sakura Badge for pre-school. Kogoro accidentally steps on it and breaks it, so Eri makes Ran a temporary one using colored paper and cardboard.\nMeanwhile, a man and a woman are heard talking over something. Their faces are not yet revealed. He says, \"She isn't going to come back.\" Not bothered at all, the woman tells him to \"reset everything\" and that \"there are no time constraints to starting over\".\nIn another scene, Yusaku is in book-signing event where a fan admires his writing that says that she liked one of the last lines of the wandering woman detective in his story: \"There are no time constraints to starting over.\" She hails from Hokkaido. Yukiko calls Yusaku to inform that Shinichi's pre-school badge is missing. Yusaku accidently brought everything that was on his desk, including the badge.\nRan's paper badge is admired by Sonoko in school, but some guys don't seem too happy about it. Sonoko and one of them get into a fight over Ran's badge, which is resolved by their teacher, Ronsuke Efune. Unfortunately, Ran's badge is all crumpled up but she says that she can make it again since she saw her mom make it.\nWhile everyone is sleeping, Ran is struggling to make her badge out of paper again. This is when Shinichi approaches her. \"It's a Cherry Blossom, right?\", he says. Upon Ran asking why, he presents his deduction. By the time he finishes, everyone is listening and amused. But Ran doesn't seem too flattered by someone who called her a \"crybaby\". Sonoko admires him but Ran tries to refute his claim exclaiming that she wasn't crying. Yukiko arrives and scolds Shinichi for running away and losing his badge. Shinichi says that he was telling Ran to make a new one for him. Yukiko recognizes Ran as Eri's daughter. Ran asks for Shinichi name and writes it on the badge, telling him that he can keep it, but he has to promise that Ran is not a crybaby so he won't ever call her that.\nBack to the present, Ran says that she couldn't digest the fact that Shinichi being just a kid himself like everyone was acting all like an adult. She was actually crying because the badge her mom made for her was ruined. At that time, she couldn't understand the real reason why Shinichi asked her to make a badge for him.\nAnother day in the school, Shinichi catches Efune staring at Ran while singing. Sonoko claims that Efune can do that since he's the teacher and very popular, so much that many kids want to marry him when they grow up. Upon asking if she likes Efune, Ran shies away from Shinichi shouting why would she tell him that.\nLater that day, Shinichi confronts Efune regarding some inconsistencies he found in his behavior towards Ran. He presents his questions: Why would he hold her hand when they cross the street? Why would he let her slide first in the park? Why would the location of the park be changed to a distant one without any reason? Why does Ran only have a designated spot for sleeping? He concludes that Efune is trying to win her over and do bad things to her. Efune states his reasons: He holds her hand because one time she lost the way and ended up on the other side of town in Haido City. He lets her slide first because she always ends up letting everybody go first and doesn't get to slide herself sometimes. And she sleeps where she does because it is nearest to the bathroom as one time she was sleeping so far away that she didn't make it. He says that he'll state his reasons for switching the park the next day.\nRan says that Shinichi actually pretended to solve her 'Sakura badge' case, when he had seen her being bullied and thus knew everything from the beginning. Conan's perspective of the story is explored in this episode.  Back then, all he saw through the glass was a girl who was upset because she had something taken from her and the word 'outsider'. \"It was the first time I had made a heart-pounding deduction.\", he speaks to himself and continues to narrate his side of the story.\nThe story goes back to the scene when everything started. Yukiko is searching for Shinichi's badge and calls Yusaku to enquire about it. Meanwhile, Shinichi is lost in a mystery book. He reads, \"If one simply knocks out all the central inferences, and presents one's audience with the starting-point and conclusion, one may produce a startling, though possibly a meretricious, effect.\" Shinichi seems typically embarrassed about wearing glasses when his mother tells him that he will end up wearing them if he reads in the dark.\nThey leave to Yusaku's book-signing event where Yusaku hands-over the badge and Shinichi clips it to his shirt. Shinichi and his mother arrive next at Beika Pre-school. Efune is carrying out the formalities for Shinichi joining pre-school. Wandering in search of the library, Shinichi ends up opening the doors to the room Ran and others are sleeping in. His first reaction is to be shocked at the sight of so many children lying in rows, which he mistook for a morgue from a scene he saw in a movie. He walks by the sleeping children and finds Ran crying. He sees her uniform missing a badge. He looks at the folds she is making from a distance and accurately deduces it to be a Cherry Blossom Petal from when he saw his dad making stars for decorating the Christmas Tree. He's embarrassed to ask her if he's right. When he tries to speak, he sees a badge made of paper. \"What was taken from her wasn't a plastic badge.\", he realises. He removes his own badge and all while maintaining his serious expression, tells her, \"Make me one, too. (Pause) It's a cherry blossom, right?\" He is worried if he's wrong in his deduction. Ran asks him how did he know that. Shinichi thinks she is making of him and explains his deduction, additionally calling her a 'crybaby'. Everyone is amused but Ran is mad at him. \"I'm not a crybaby.\" She exclaims. Shinichi argues that she was crying, but Ran is insistent that she wasn't. That's when Yukiko finds Shinichi and starts scolding him. Shinichi tells her that he lost his nametag while he hides it in his pocket. The situation plays out like Ran's viewpoint, except only that Shinichi notices Efune staring darkly at Ran.\nThat day Shinichi explains to his parents why he finds that something is wrong with his new teacher Efune. Yukiko teases Shinichi that he's just being jealous because his teacher gives all his attention to Ran. Yusaku, however, thinks that there is a problem if Efune is playing favorites. He enquires if Shinichi had asked his teacher about his weird behavior. Shinichi tells the reasons Efune explained him earlier. Yusaku finally asks if Ran is the last one to wake up from sleep, to which Shinichi replies yes. Yusaku apparently has a fan from Hokkaido who shares her surname \"Efune\" with Shinichi's teacher.\nThe next day continues to Ran telling Sonoko about her mom scolding her for bullying. Only this time, a detective watches a suspicious figure in a car taking a photo of the kids. In the next scene in Beika Park where Efune explains his reason to Shinichi for changing their park, the detective watches the suspicious figure behind Efune's wife handing her the camera. The detective is none other than Yusaku.\n",
    "People": "- Yusaku's fan\n- Hokkaido resident\n- 39 years old (13 years ago)\n- Pre-school teacher\n- Ronsuke's wife\n- Hospitalized\n- Bullies Ran\n- Kindergarten teacher\n- Kindergarten teacher\n",
    "Resolution": "\nTwo days later, it is raining and the kids are sleeping. Efune is worried about something. Two teachers in the hallway notice a black van parked outside the rear exit of the pre-school for a while and wonder if they should report it to the police. Efune tells them that he will go and check it out. While Efune runs towards in the rain, it is revealed that the woman and man in the scene at the very start of the previous episode were none other than his wife and Efune himself. Efune opens the door of the van and shouts, \"Let's not do this!\" To which Yusaku, who is seated as the driver, replies: \"Let's not have this conversation in the rain.\" He invites him in the passenger seat and explains to him that his plan has been foiled. His brother-in-law who was breaking into the pre-school through the bathroom window has been arrested and is being questioned by the Police, in suspicion of trying to kidnap Ran Mouri.\n- Each day Efune held Ran's hand so that his brother-in-law would know which child they should kidnap.\n- He announced her name and held her high in the slide in the park so that his wife could get a good look at her.\n- He had Ran take her nap closer to the bathroom so that she'd be the one closest when his brother-in-law broke into the daycare through the bathroom window.\n- Efune had also slipped Ran sedatives to make the whole process easier. As a result, she was confused and did certain things unintentionally, like soiling herself in her nap.\n- Efune showed her special attention so that other children would be jealous of her and bully her. Then he wrote in her handbook that she was bullying children and made her mother scold her without an actual reason; that way, Ran would come to trust her teacher more than her parents.\nEfune was aiding his brother-in-law in kidnapping a gentle and quiet little girl like Ran Mouri, so that his wife could start raising 'her' daughter all over again, from when she was the cutest and more docile. He was trying to win her over so that he and his wife could live happily with her thereafter, but Shinichi caught on some details so he rushes the plan to kidnap her before he'd be found out. Still, when Shinichi told his parents about Efune's behavior, Yusaku started putting two and two together. He even tells Efune that, while the other children are asleep, Shinichi is fully awake -- and standing next to Ran's sleeping spot, taking care of her.\nEfune explains that few years ago, his teenage daughter ran away from home. His very frail wife suffers from neurosis and has been so grief-stricken over the situation that she tried to kill herself and developed anorexia, so he and his brother-in-law believed that they had to carry out the kidnapping plan so she'd be more stable and recover the will to live.\nEfune requests Yusaku that his wife be left out of this, but she has already surrendered to the Police with their daughter. The daughter is none other than Yusaku's fan from Hokkaido, who was deeply touched by his story. She had said a runaway herself, she could relate to the situation when the female detective discovers the runaway faking her suicide and says those words to make her return to her parents. Additionally, she said that she was from Hokkaido (a place where many students from Tokyo go on school trips and which could be a reasonable hiding spot for a runaway teen), but had habits that weren't shared by Hokkaido people (like using an umbrella when it snowed). Yusaku concludes that Efune will be able to see his daughter, but in exchange, he must to turn himself in to the Police. Nearby, Kogoro Mouri and Juzo Megure are impatiently waiting for the culprit to surrender.\nThe next day, the kids are shocked and those who liked Efune cry hearing that he has quit. However, Ran, who earlier said that she wasn't a crybaby, holds back her tears. Shinichi tells her then that she can cry when she feels like it and that he won't call her a crybaby anymore. Ran finally gives in to her sorrow, and cries leaning on Shinichi's shoulder.\n",
