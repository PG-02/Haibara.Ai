    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Heiji and Kazuha visit Tokyo where the two part ways. A man is dead at the restaurant Kazuha is in, forcing Kogoro, Ran, Sera, Heiji, and Conan to investigate.\n\nThe witness is Andre Camel who explains the victim's last words were a confession to a poisoning. Heiji reveals the victim was speaking in a Kansai dialect and the victim's actual words were referring to an unknown culprit as the poisoner. Realizing the culprit is still in the restaurant, the police narrow down the suspects to three people without their alibis. After Heiji is unable to trick the culprits into revealing their Kansai dialect, Conan arranges the three culprits to drink salty soup. They are later informed the man was the primary discoverer of the victim in a murder case that happened in Saitama last week.\n\n",
    "People": "- Victim (poison)\n- Part-time employee\n- 39 years old\n- Customer\n- 36 years old\n- Customer\n- 45 years old\n- Customer\n- Danny's waitress\n- Kengo's coworker\n- Deceased (poison)\n- Company president\n",
    "Resolution": "In addition, while acting as a left-hander, Amakasu is really right-handed, as the arrangement of his dishes easily proves. He had used his right hand to administer the poison to his victim and did not want to end up his own victim as well, even after cleaning his hand with a wet napkin usually served along with ramen, which is the reason why he had ordered ramen while the police checked the crime scene.\n\nAs it turns out, Amakasu is responsible for murdering his firm's manager in order to rob money from his office some time earlier, and Shibamiya, who had introduced Amakasu, a childhood friend, to his manager for employment, attempted to persuade him to surrender to the police. Amakasu decided to silence him, so he lured Shibamiya to the restaurant toilet and poisoned him.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is the last episode where Iemasa Kayumi recorded his voice as James Black, as he passed away on September 30, 2014. However, this is not the last episode featuring his voice, as James appeared in flashback during Jodie's Memories and the Cherry Blossom Viewing Trap and The Scarlet Truth.\n- There are several abnormalities, events, and scenes in the case that are worth noting.  There are three instances where Ran's behavior implies she knows Conan is Shinichi. The first is that she references how Heiji and Shinichi only faced off each other once, but lately have been solving cases together. The wording is what is being called into the spotlight, because there are only 3-4 cases that they even meet up in total, while her words indicate they have met many more times on several occasions. As Heiji has shown clear interest in being with Conan, and has been solving cases with him, this implies she knows Conan is Shinichi or else her wording would be different. The second is when Heiji starts asking about the female detective sniffing around about Kudo. Neither Ran nor Sera correct him, which is especially odd for Ran since she should have found that strange. Sera has only been asking about Conan, not Shinichi, so the lack of a correction throughout the whole case indicates she knows he was referring to Conan when he said Kudo. Finally, when Ran asks to talk to Shinichi over Conan's phone and gets seemingly disappointed that he already hung up. However, she could have just easily called him with her own phone right there since she knew he was available, yet doesn't. This implies she might have just been putting on an act.\n- The bus at the beginning is the same from The Mysterious Passenger.\n- The suspects' names come from \"family dine-in restaurants\"[1] :\nRakutoshi Sugai (須貝 絡利) comes from Skylark Holdings (すかいらーく ,Sukairāku?), a company operating multiple family diners in Japan ;\nToru Amakasu (甘粕 亨) comes from Gusto (ガスト ,Gasuto?), a restaurant chain owned by Skylark ;\nSanpei Tojo (東條 参平) comes from Jonathan's (ジョナサン ,Jonasan?), a restaurant chain owned by Skylark ;\nKengo Shibamiya (柴宮 研吾) comes from Bamiyan (バーミヤン ,Bāmiyan?), a restaurant chain owned by Skylark.\n- Rakutoshi Sugai (須貝 絡利) comes from Skylark Holdings (すかいらーく ,Sukairāku?), a company operating multiple family diners in Japan ;\n- Toru Amakasu (甘粕 亨) comes from Gusto (ガスト ,Gasuto?), a restaurant chain owned by Skylark ;\n- Sanpei Tojo (東條 参平) comes from Jonathan's (ジョナサン ,Jonasan?), a restaurant chain owned by Skylark ;\n- Kengo Shibamiya (柴宮 研吾) comes from Bamiyan (バーミヤン ,Bāmiyan?), a restaurant chain owned by Skylark.\n- Rakutoshi Sugai (須貝 絡利) comes from Skylark Holdings (すかいらーく ,Sukairāku?), a company operating multiple family diners in Japan ;\n- Toru Amakasu (甘粕 亨) comes from Gusto (ガスト ,Gasuto?), a restaurant chain owned by Skylark ;\n- Sanpei Tojo (東條 参平) comes from Jonathan's (ジョナサン ,Jonasan?), a restaurant chain owned by Skylark ;\n- Kengo Shibamiya (柴宮 研吾) comes from Bamiyan (バーミヤン ,Bāmiyan?), a restaurant chain owned by Skylark.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In this one hour episode, some scenes are not from the manga:\n- The conversation between Conan and Heiji on phone at the beginning.\n- The conversation between Heiji and Kazuha on the bus.\n- Conan tells Ran about Heiji and Kazuha visit. Sera overhears the conversation and joins them.\n- Kazuha scolded Heiji for making inconsiderate remarks about Camel \"even if it's true\", which Ran then told Kazuha that was also inconsiderate to say out loud too.\n- Ran and Kazuha taking down the culprit who is trying to escape. Sera was impressed by Kazuha's skills.\n- In the anime, Sera wore a jacket over her shirt, while she did not wear one in the manga.\n",
