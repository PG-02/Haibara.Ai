    "Situation": "Sonoko invites Ran to a party held by real estate company manager Kensaku Takada, and Conan inevitably has to follow them since Kogoro is off to drink with the neighborhood association. At the party, they get to meet Kensaku and his wife, Konomi. Kensaku, who heard from Sonoko that Ran is a karate champion, says that he also once practiced karate in college, and out of his passionate talking, starts striking poses. While not mentioned by anyone, Kensaku’s sleeves pull up slightly during this talk, revealing an expensive-looking watch.\nUpon seeing Rika, Kensaku’s maid, walk past him, he calls her over to bring some drinks. Unfortunately, Rika bumps into one of the guests and accidentally spills the drinks onto Kensaku, which makes him furious and he nearly strikes her before Konomi intervenes. Konomi suggests him to go change his clothes, and Kensaku leaves the room, before Konomi also leaves to head to the powder room. Conan then spots a worried-looking man holding his phone intently before the man also exits the room.\nAfter some time, Konomi returns, but Kensaku is still missing. Rika, now with a red mark on her cheek, tells Konomi that Kensaku went out to smoke. Konomi then instructs Rika to go get Kensaku. Meanwhile, Sonoko notices that Konomi had changed her shoes, and also invites Ran to change into a different pair of shoes. When questioned by Conan, Sonoko reveals the party to be a dance party, where participants wear special dancing shoes. She reminds Ran that wearing accessories are not allowed. But not long before the dancing is about to begin, a scream from Rika interrupts the excitement—she has found Kensaku, who had fallen to his death.\n\nThe police arrive, with Takagi noting that Kensaku had been drinking before his death, suggesting that his drunken state led him to accidentally fall over the mansion’s fencing and, due to the property’s elevation, injure his head on the pavement below. However, Conan denies this as an accident, having noticed many footprints in the yard above, indicating a fight between Kensaku and a possible killer. The police, Ran, and Sonoko head back up to the mansion’s yard to see the footprints, but Conan stays back, and finds that Kensaku’s watch is missing. Apparently, the forensics officer had found the watch in Kensaku’s jacket pocket, not on his wrist.\nBack at the mansion, the police take a look at the footprints. Considering their wide extent across the yard, they assume Kensaku had an intense fight with whoever killed him. There are also four sets of footprints, which are from Kensaku, Rika, Conan and the murderer. Strangely, some footprints are whole while others are halved, as if the halved footprints were created from a person standing on their tiptoes.\nConan helps the police narrow down the suspects to those who left the party venue before Kensaku’s death. They are Konomi, Rika, and the worried-looking man from before, who is introduced as Satoru.\nOf the three, Satoru is the only one with a motive, being financially indebted to Kensaku. The police later find a pair of dancing shoes in the yard that match with the fourth set of footprints. It bears a small mud print. Satoru confesses that the shoes belong to him, and the police decide that he is the culprit. Conan, though, notices something between Satoru’s dancing shoes and the shoes Satoru was currently wearing.\nConan decides to investigate some more, and heads into the mansion’s kitchen, where he sees Rika searching for something on the floor. That “something” is her earring, which for some reason had been dropped. Heading back out to the yard, Conan finds that forensics had finished recording the footprints. Conan then has Takagi and Chiba reenact the murder by stepping onto the footprints. But when Takagi is forced to stand on his tiptoes, he loses balance. The experiment is seemingly useless, and Satoru is being taken away by the police for questioning.\nConan, holding the forensic officer’s record of the footprints, passes by Ran. Ran notices that the footprints look similar to a step diagram, which Sonoko used when teaching Ran how to dance. It is not long before Sonoko is seen kneeling on the ground…and “Sonoko’s” deduction show begins.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (fell)\n- 45 years old\n- Real estate company manager\n- Party organizer\n- 28 years old\n- Kensaku's wife\n- 22 years old\n- Maid\n- 36 years old\n- Kensaku's acquaintance\n- Party attendee\n- Tokyo MPD forensics officer\n",
    "Resolution": "To start with, Satoru’s dancing shoes were definitely used in the murder, but on closer inspection, the laces on the dancing shoes are being tied more tightly than the laces on Satoru’s shoes, indicating that whoever was wearing them during the murder had smaller feet than Satoru. Therefore, Satoru is not the culprit. Moreover, the real culprit wanted to frame Satoru.\nNext is Rika, who has a red mark on her cheek. The mark was from when Kensaku struck her in the kitchen, which was also when she lost her earring. However, it is not possible for her to have murder Kensaku by pushing him over the yard’s fencing, since Kensaku has karate skills and would have been able to defend. Thus, Rika is not the culprit.\nThis leaves Konomi, but being Kensaku’s wife, she does not have a motive. Yet, considering the method used to murder Kensaku, she is the only one who could have done it. Kensaku was murdered while he was dancing, which is proven by two clues. The first are the halved footprints. If you were to push someone, you would have to dig your heels into the ground. Tiptoeing does the opposite; it is impossible to generate enough force in that position to push someone such that they would lose their balance. This is confirmed with how Takagi lost his balance in the reenactment of the murder. The second is the fact that Kensaku’s wristwatch was found in his jacket pocket. Kensaku probably removed the watch in order to dance, since accessories are not allowed to be worn while dancing. The only person who could have danced with Kensaku is his wife, Konomi Takada.\nConan, through Sonoko’s voice, says that Konomi most likely stole Satoru’s dancing shoes, then lured Kensaku into the yard by saying that she wanted to practice dancing some more before the event. As they danced, Konomi slowly lured Kensaku to the edge of the yard. Konomi then tripped Kensaku over the fencing, but Kensaku accidentally stepped onto the dancing shoes Konomi was wearing, leaving a mud print. Considering that not much time had passed since the incident, Conan deduces that Konomi must still have a red mark on her foot from when Kensaku stepped on her.\nSure enough, Konomi takes off her heels to reveal the mark where Kensaku stepped on her.\nKonomi’s motive was that Kensaku didn’t really love her as a true wife, he only married her to be his “trophy wife” and brag and boast about her to other people. As for framing Satoru, she says that she would have framed anyone who had a possible motive to kill Kensaku.\nRan, Sonoko, and Conan are walking home when Sonoko mentions how they didn’t get to dance at Kensaku’s party, and suddenly starts dancing with Ran on the street. Quite comically, Sonoko ends up banging her head on a nearby utility pole.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The title of this episode pays homage to the final Ninzaburo Furuhata film The LastFinal Dance (ファイナル ラスト・ダンス).\n- This episode was outsourced to 8bit, which is a well-known animation company in the anime industry. This was most likely due to TMS Entertainment having previously been contracted by 8bit to work on an episode of Laid-Back Camp Season 3.[N 1]\n",
