    "Situation": "A morning in the dreary-but-peaceful forest kicked off with a customary morning radio - Moriyama Shu's Morning Frolic. The shabby machine still managed to work despite its treacherous vicinity; it was being wrapped upon one of the trees: with an alarm clock assigned to six o'clock straight. If it was propagating the radio program, six o'clock must have arrived. Whilst broadcasting the program, the machine seemed to possess a built-in feature that automatically distributed some bird food at that time. With the food loaded onto the plate, two birds who were resting on the branches swiftly dashed towards it, seizing the first pleasure of the day. Just as the two birds were rejoicing over their \"breakfast\", an atrocious crow cropped up, brutally blasting them away. For some reason, the excessive force exerted by the crow on the plate of that radio machine lead the plank to fall apart - this activated a pulley-like wheel, resulting in several dominoes to fall, overlapping each other; afterwards, it pushed a tiny marble to slide down a pre-prepared track, with all those momentum the ball gather along the long journey upon the track, it eventually rebounded at a metal can, bumping into a glass bottle which was attached with a rope; this then triggered a brick to be thrown onto a platform made out of wooden block, thereupon, the timber that were deposited on top of that platform fell accordingly, landing exactly at a lever device; finally, the axe that was originally quiet sitting on it ejected with a considerably amount of force. After all of those gimmicks, parts of a chimney fell abruptly from a nearby villa, this was followed by a tragic scream.\n\nCoincidentally, the Mouri family were lingering around the district as well. They were there because of Kogoro's affair: a client of his requested him to ascertain the identity of the intruder who has been on the rampage around his house; however, they managed to solve the mystery effortlessly, and the truth turned out to be that the intruder was merely a raccoon. As a result, they were on their way home, conversing jovially. After some minutes, they noticed Inspector Yamamura within a few miles, standing beside a huge mansion. Right after he saw them, he instantly waved at them. Kogoro thus inquired of him about what case he was investigating, and Yamamura responded that there seemed to be an accident that happened a while ago, with the outcome of having one deceased: a middle-aged man who got struck down by the fallen chimney pipe, when he was drinking coffee on the deck of the mansion. Ran remarked that she has seen the victim already on TV, and Yamamura uttered that the victim is named Kohei Inoue, who is the chairman of the chain restaurant \"Cheom Cheom\". Even though the situation at the crime scene made several people, including Yamamura, believe that the victim lost his life in a sorrow accident, but Conan, who has perceptive insight, immediately realised that it was actually a murder! He then pointed out that at one end of the chimney pipe, which took Inoue's life, the interface was apparently dented. With this detail recognized, he surmised that it must have been caused by mankind.\nBy adjusting the perspective to the case, Inspector Yamamura thus advanced on investigating some acquaintances of Inoue, and found out that there were four people who lived in the same mansion: Fuma Tanaka, the president and CEO of \"Cheom Cheom\"; Norihiro Shimada, an investor who invested on \"Cheom Cheom\"; Arata Kawamoto, another investor who has been friends with the victim since school; Nanako Inoue, the victim's second wife, meanwhile the person who discovered the body. In addition, everyone that Yamamura mentioned possessed an alibi, except Inoue's wife.\nAfter hearing about the possible suspects in the case, Conan decided to look for some clues. He utilized his criminal tracking glasses and glanced around: he then noticed a wooden house with intricate types of objects and determined that it must have something to do with the crime. He also urged the others to tag along; as they arrived there, they saw the radio machine along with that fallen plate. Conan contemplated and gazed at the alarm display with the time \"6AM\". As Ran questioned him about the situation, he explained to her about the notion of the \"Rube Goldberg Machine\", which was basically a set of mechanisms that liaise altogether, performing a simple action but in countless different steps and fashions. He then deduced that most likely, the culprit also used this type of machine to set up this automated murder.\nPuzzled, the four of them entered the mansion and began asking the victim's wife some questions. They then learned that the victim had always gotten the habit of drinking coffee in the morning, at the exact spot and time. Kogoro thus deduced that the culprit most likely took advantage over this habit, and devised this complicated mechanical trick, as it would work out quite impressively since the victim's lifestyle was rather fixed. Yamamura then exclaimed that this would make solving this case much easier since they could simply narrow down the suspect circle with only the personnel who knew this habit. However, the victim's wife's proceeding words splattered Yamamura's figments of fantasies - the victim just got to disclose this habit some months ago on the TV, so technically, most people would have known this habit he had.\nThe victim's wife, Nanako, accused the president of \"Cheom Cheom\", Tanaka, for this murder. So they visited the restaurant where Tanaka worked. Tanaka kept insisting on his innocence, and reluctantly denying the accusation. After some questioning, he revealed that he really did undergone some unpleasant arguments with the victim not long ago, but that was concerning the Yangnyeom chicken sauce: the restaurants sold yangnyeom fried chicken, and the meal had to be laced with a special sauce that is sweet and spicy. Tanaka then explained that the sauce that he currently uses was invented by the founder of the restaurant, and he had no access to the secret recipe. He begged the victim many times for this recipe, just in case something would happen to him, but his request was being remorselessly turned down by the victim, who was obstinately against offering the recipe to Tanaka.\nAfter visiting the \"Cheom Cheom\" president, Tanaka, everyone decided to have a word with Kawamoto, an unemployed investor who was friends with the victim. In front of Inspector Yamamura, he justified his integrity by demonstrating to everyone that there was literally no reason for him to murder Inoue, as they were not at odds, or any of the kind. After some unproductive talks, Kawamoto introduced them to another person who has a relationship to the victim - the proprietress of Club Rokumaikai, Manami Teshima. He claimed her to be Inoue's mistress. Accordingly, hoping to gather some useful information, rushed to find her, and fortunately, she was also in the same resort area, so meeting her came very handy in this scenario. Yamamura began to ask her questions. Teshima declared that the victim helped her open the club she now owned. Seeing how close Teshima was to the victim, Kogoro proceeded with his inquiry, asking if she knew who would hold grudges against the victim. Teshima thus responded to him that she in fact could relate to a person - Norihiro Shimada, one of the investors in the \"Cheom Cheom\" restaurant. Evidently, he had just had a tremendous quarrel with the victim from a few days back, and it happened to take place within her club. Afterwards, the police brought to them some findings regarding this investor. This proved that Teshima was not lying to them: Shimada had a fatal argument with the victim with respect to some company management policy; however, Shimada went too far by pointing fingers at the victim and roaring cruel words such as \"I'll kill you\". With this piece of information, Kogoro speculated that most likely their fight had escalated into a murder.\nAt the same time, within Shimada's lodging, a sense of malice was lurking in the room... Just as Shimada was taking a shower, there was a black silhouette acting suspiciously within his house.\nBack to Kogoro's end, Conan looked up Shimada on the internet and found out that he was previously a passionate member of the Rube Goldberg Machine Club from the Haido University; and according to the website Conan searched, Shimada was precisely the president of the club that year, which could testify his ability of making Rube Goldberg machines. This did not wash up his innocence but seemed to append a further evidence for him being the murderer. While Yamamura and Kogoro were discussing and considering talking with Shimada, Conan strolled out and peered at the frozen lakes, where the snow was ubiquitous. Teshima showed up behind him and talked with Conan proactively. She told Conan that if he genuinely solved this puzzling Rube Goldberg Machine case, she would love to treat Conan a meal at her club, and Conan chuckled. All of a sudden, Kawamoto interrupted their conversation and started to overwhelm her with harsh words. Teshima, on the other hand, obviously was unwilling to back down, and stuck him with even more aggressive sentences - she declared that Kawamoto had a motive to kill the victim since Kawamoto nearly married Nanako, so in a way, Inoue \"stole\" a girl out of Kawamoto. Nevertheless, Kawamoto then began to suspect Teshima as the culprit simultaneously, since she had some affairs with Shimada as well, apparently.\n- Conan constructed a suspect relationship chart in his mind\n- \nConan heard all of that, and timely, Ran came to pick him up because Kogoro and Inspector Mamamura decided to pursue the prime suspect they currently had, Norihiro Shimada. They went to his lodging community but heard the news that Shimada was out. Conan thus began investigating Shimada's house alone, trying to dig up some valuable clues. He approached his house from the back side, where those big windows were installed. He noticed a pair of footsteps leading to that glass door upon the huge window. Conan was able to enter Shimada's house through that glass window. Within his room, there was an opened liquor and some left-over yanghyeom chicken on the table, and on the floor, right next to Shimada's bed, Conan found a sheet of paper that had the structure of the Rube Goldberg machine drawn on it. Conan promptly understood it was the plan for the complex Rube Goldberg mechanism they saw this morning. This further suggested that it was Shimada who plotted this murder, since he was quite into the Rube Goldberg machine itself.\nYamamura, Kogoro, and Ran got to Shimada's room too. Conan received another prominent clue from Yamamura: Shimada was sketching that Rube Goldberg machine plan in a public area and was apparently showing off to other people, and numerous witnesses could verify this fact. This precisely matched the tossed Rube Goldberg Machine plan paper in Shimada's house.\nYamamura then received a phone call from an anonymous user. The content of this call was that they saw Shimada buying mitarashi dango at a certain outlet mall; although this statement was doubted by Kogoro, they still attempted to go around and search for him. But then, Yamamura received another phone call, informing him that Shimada was also seen in a shop, eating tenzaru soba; but after some time, another phone call claimed Shimada to be buying homemade sausages in a shopping centre. This made Yamamura and Kogoro question the validity of the eyewitness information. With this predicament, they have been mandering around the area like a manipulated marionette. At last, Yamamura was told that a body was found, under the bridge that they were about to cross, and judging by the body's clothes and appearance, that was definitely Norihiro Shimada.\n\nHaving identified the victim as Norihiro Shimada, Conan and the majority began to scrutinize the crime scene. Inspector Yamamura initially thought that Shimada most likely committed suicide, probably due to the timidity and panic he possessed at that time. Jumping off the bridge seemed rather justifiable for this consequence. Notwithstanding that, Conan did not feel convinced at all. He inspected scrupulously at Shimada's dead body and found out a relatively useful clue: the scarf that the deceased wore was assuredly the off one out. The reason that this notion arose from Conan's mind was that, except for this scarf, other clothes that the victim had seemed quite worth a fortune (expensive brands). Conversely, the scarf that the body had is a fairly cheap and crude one, more commonly found in society, simply.\nWith this perplexity in mind, Yamamura was instructed to take off that scraf of the body. And what was beneath the scraf was... a noticeable mark caused by strangulation. Despite Yamamura thinking it would be plausible for the victim to strangulate himself while jumping down the bridge, Kogoro cut the non-sense out immediately and confidently proclaimed that this could be treated as murder from now on.\nAfter finishing checking the body out, Kogoro, Ran, and Conan stayed at the police station and attempted to unravel some of the mysteries. All of a sudden, Yamamura entered the room and handed in a piece of paper - it was the prenuptial contract signed by Kohei Inoue and Nanako Inoue. It was written clearly on the paper that if Kohei died before Nanako, all of his heritage would be transferred to Nanako, including that secret recipe for Yangnyeom chicken sauce. However, if Nanako acted unloyal to Kohei, she would not get a tinge of this legacy; precisely, all of them would be granted to an animal welfare society. Then here came the contradictory part: the entire contract was invariably limiting the freedom of Nanako, whereas there were no words stating the consequences if the other party, in this case, Kohei, would undergo, if unloyalty was manifested. As a result, Kogoro concluded that this was typically what we would call an \"one-sided\" contract, basically being unfair to Nanako. Conan also offered that by talking with the suspects, he learned that Nanako actually knew the presence of Kohei's mistress, thus in a way she could hold grudges against her husband.\nConan then reviewed that photo taken a few years back, concerning the Rube Goldberg Machine Club at Haido University, where Shimada was present. He finally realized that one of the girls who appeared in that photo was, in fact, Teshima. He was able to confirm this due to the moles on her face. Therefore, when Kawamoto was scolding Teshima, the remark \"you and Shimada go way back\" rang true. Though he still could not understand why she would conceal that information from everyone when accepting their inquiry.\nKogoro sighed and remarked that all of the suspects and clues seemed to all connect to each other, forming a sort of chain. Just like the Rube Goldberg Machine. Meanwhile, Conan thought that even though they really looked like they were all connected, some parts just detached somehow. Puzzled, he thought profoundly and had a slight epiphany in his mind. He then whispered towards Yamamura for some requests. However in the name of Shinichi Kudo. Hearing that it was the renowned detective \"Shinichi\" who asked for some assistance, Yamamura implemented it instantly. When he gave the results to Conan, Conan understood everything and smirked with his utmost confidence.\nConan began to set things up, and Yamamura, on the other hand, gathered all of the suspects at the police station. After declaring that they had identified the culprit for this serial murder case, everyone was dumbfounded. \"Great detective Kogoro Mouri is here... but,\" Yamamura uttered. \"the greater detective Kudo...\" Just as he was about to say the famed name of \"Kudo Shinichi\", Conan perceived that it would be unsuitable for him to continue this sentence, as, for both, it would shatter Kogoro's vanity, and would make Ran feel confused. So right in time, Conan tranquillized him and took over this awkward speech, \"Kudo Shinichi won't be solving this case either.\" Yamamura was fully in the coma.\n",

    "Resolution": "",
    "Inoue's murderer": "The culprit of Inoue's murder was none other than the investor Arata Kawamoto, who prepared the Rube Goldberg Machine knowing beforehand Inoue's habit to drink coffee at 6:00 AM, and like that, made a solid alibi for himself. He also knew about Shimada's discussion with the victim, and to frame him, he also broke into Shimada's house to hide the Rube Goldberg Machine plans. This would make other people think that Shimada has been acting up since the beginning. Conan then showed camera footage that captured Kawamoto during the time of the crime. Although this could kind of \"prove\" Kawamoto's innocence as an alibi. Conan still said that it was rather deliberate of him to do so. Seeing the overwhelming accusations coming in front of his face, Kawamoto shouted impulsively and inquired of Yamamura for evidence, and Conan gave him some: the footprints that led towards Shimada's house that Conan found; this was proof that someone had intruded Shimada's house while Shimada was taking his shower. Evidently, these sets of footprints had a perfect match with Kawamoto's unique shoe design.\nSurprisingly, he didn't kill Shimada, as it wouldn't make sense to frame him and later disguise his death as suicide, that is, the manners of the two cases were far off each other; in the first one, Inoue was murdered with such convoluted mechanical Rube Goldberg Machine tricks, whereas Shimada was murdered with just a simple scarf. Meaning that Shimada's murderer took advantage of the first murder to kill his victim.\n",
    "Shimada's murderer": "The second killer's identity is revealed to be that of the CEO, Fuma Tanaka, who was under a lot of pressure and became desperate, fearing that the secret sauce recipe would be revealed. Due to the fact that the investors treated him coldly, Tanaka snapped and strangled Shimada to make his death look like a suicide, then he threw Shimada's body from the bridge. After that, he hid the strangle marks with a scarf; he then made several anonymous phonecalls to Inspector Yamamura, giving out false witnesses of seeing Shimada in certain locations that were not even close to reality. Another evidence to support this murder theory must be the manner in which Tanaka lived. By observing his appearance when they first talked with him in the \"Cheom Cheom\" restaurant, Conan already knew that Tanaka did not seem much worried with respect to his appearance, since he would not feel afraid of meeting people with his hair absolutely messy, and not changing his clothing when it had stains on it; this explained why he would wear that cheap scarf on the neck of Shimada despite it not matching with the rest of his clothes. Even if he tried to hide what he had done, DNA and fingerprints would soon be found all over the area.\n",
    "Another Rube Goldberg Machine?": "After showing the truth to everyone, it was announced that Kawamoto and Tanaka would be arrested for murder. Teshima felt relieved and claimed everything is over. However, Conan sensed that something did not seem correct.\nSuddenly, Kawamoto revealed that it isn't over yet, as he also planned to kill his ex-fiancee Nanako Inoue, the chairman's wife, by crushing her with the bell at the same wedding chapel where he almost married Nanako but fled along with Inoue. Kawamoto declared that this time Nanako would be killed by a Rube Goldberg Machine that he devised. (The mechanism first started due to the flame from the candle; it ignited a string that was attached to a piece of paper that blocked the movement of a marble. As the paper was burned, the ball began to move and slide down a track. The marble then passed down through numerous tubes, eventually leading towards a tiny boat that was initially resting upon the stream. The boat thus began moving along with the water current, this marble then ended up entering that wedding chapel, afterwards, it caused several dominoes to collapse, finally triggering the bell to fall)\nKawamoto lured Nanako there by threatening her with the terms that if she did not arrive there on time, he would expose the secret that Nanako was meeting other men without the knowledge of Inoue, and as stated within the contract, she would thus lose all the inheritance, as well as that secret recipe for Yangnyeom chicken. Just as everyone was anxious regarding the location that Nanako would get set up, Conan successfully deduced the location by hearing their bygone.\nKogoro and Ran were  able to get to the chapel before that Rube Goldberg Machine activated. Conan helped Ran identify the location where the bell would be activated. And wisely grabbed the bronze pillar platform that was nearby for decoration purposes; she thew it with the maximum force that she could accomplish - it then impeded the flow of the marble and Nanako's life was saved.\n\n",
    "Aftermath": "After the case had been resolved, the Mouri family relaxed in Mouri Detective Agency. They saw Yamamura on TV, boasting himself that he had successfully cracked the elusive case that happened in the district for which he was responsible. Ran then brought some food that she had just made to Kogoro and Conan. After having a bite of it, Kogoro and Conan loved it instantly. And apparently, Ran replicated the sauce for \"Cheom Cheom\" Yangnyeom chicken, she drew memories from eating it in that restaurant.\nShe said that, by adding mentsuyu to the Yangnyeom chicken will pretty much make it taste just like the one from \"Cheom Cheom\". Kogoro complained and remarked that he never thought that the so-called secret recipe would end up being this simple.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The \"Rube Goldberg machine\" referred to in the title originates from the American cartoonist, Rube Goldberg's works. This term manifests mechanical combinations that are designed to be overly complex and complete simple actions in a circuitous manner.\n- The convoluted mechanical tricks rendered as the main theme of the case, in fact resemble a type of mystery school named Shinhonkaku Detective Fiction (新本格派推理):\nThe case character Norihiro Shimada (島田 典弘)'s surname, was obviously inspired by the renowned mystery writer, Soji Shimada (島田 荘司 ,Shimada Sōji?), a mystery writer who has written several Shinhonkaku mysteries;\nLikewise, the guest speaker that appeared on the radio goes by the name \"Mitarashi Dango-san\".
