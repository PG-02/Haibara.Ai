Shinichi and Ran travelling through the same footpath give them their ball back. Ran questions why Shinichi left soccer, since he would have been a Samurai Blue Member by now if he continued. Shinichi explains he wanted to develop the reflexes needed for being a detective and cites Holmes who practised fencing. While Shinichi is expressing his fondness about Holmes, they hear a woman cry for help. A thief has stolen her purse. The thief makes a run but is intimidated by Hina Wada.

The guest, Takanori Sewa seems to have some problems with his New Year Party. He has been receiving threatening letters. Shinichi offers Sewa his assistance, but he declines saying that he has already increased the number of guards. When they stand to leave, Takanori accidentally puts his electronic wheelchair on reverse. Shinichi rushes to help, but Ran pushes him off, saves Takanori and catches the vase which was falling. Takanori initially scolds Ran for trying such a reckless stunt, but realizes his mistake and praises her.\nSonoko and her parents want Ran to use a special suit they made for her for the coming Karate Competition, but there are regulations for the dongi they wear in competitions. She still accepts it saying that she'll use it for her practice, if they don't mind. They are still happy. Sonoko seems all excited, since she had carved \"Love Shinichi\" on the back collar of the dongi.\nIn the end, Ran's new phone wasn't bought. Before parting ways with Shinichi, she remembers she forgot her wallet at his home. She finds it and goes to bid goodbye to Shinichi, who is reading at his home library. Ran thinks Shinichi's first crush was his actress mom, but he denies it. Ran questions then who was it? Shinichi stares for a while at Ran and tries to say that it was she, but Agasa interrupts this moment with a mobile rocket experiment gone wrong. Ran provides first-aid to Agasa. Shinichi thinks his experiments are way dangerous for a device carrying out transportation. Agasa brags that he put safety first in building his mobile rocket and starts it again.

She is definitely going to win the tournament.\n- Karate tournament referee\n",
    "Case 1: Crime at the Private Mansion": "Takanori Sewa's New Year Party has been interrupted by a murder: one of the guests, President Yamazaki of Yatsubishi Bank, was found dead with a knife that pierced through his heart. The police, led by Inspector Megure, have been investigating the crime scene, but have no conclusive evidence as to who the killer is. Shinichi makes his grand entrance and claims he has figured out the case.\n\n- Mansion owner\n- In a wheelchair due to injured leg\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- 38 years old\n- Takanori's best friend\n- Beika Bank president\n- Takanori's wife\n- Sewa household maid\n- Takanori's son\n- Shinichi states that the room Yamazaki was killed in was locked from the inside. The only possible entrance into the room was the window.\n- The mansion owner claims that there is at least a 10 meter gap between the two windows that Shinichi states the killer used. Shinichi points out, however, that if the killer used the roof to get closer to the other window, this gap is shortened to a mere 2 meters. Therefore, it could easily be jumped across.\n- Shinichi notes that there is an indentation on the balcony where the killer attached a rope with a piece of wood at the end, allowing the killer a way to get back across to the 3rd floor window, as it is impossible for the killer to have successfully landed on the 10 centimeter roof ledge coming back. By using a piece of wood rather than simply tying the rope to the balcony, the killer was able to remove evidence of his method of escape while on the other side of the building.\n- The lack of footprints below the window implies that it was an inside job.\n- Shinichi claims to have spoken with the killer's doctor.\nShinichi concludes that the murderer could only have been someone who knew the mansion very well and eventually points his finger at the landlord. The latter, being in a wheelchair, then starts to laugh, claiming that he's in no position to be able to commit such a crime. Shinichi then grabs a globe and throws it towards the owner who immediately jumps out of his chair to avoid it. The maid and guests are all in shock. Shinichi then says that he's been healed for a while now as reported by his doctor, which Megure confirms.\n",

    "Flash Forward": "",
    "New York Scene": "",
    "Sherry Closing Scene": "",
    "Manga to special changes": "- In the manga, the victim of the first case was the mansion owner's wife. In this version, similar to the original episode, a bank president named Yamazaki was killed instead.\n- Both Gin and Conan are shown in possession of cell phones in scenes that originally did not contain them. In the original, Shinichi simply witnessed the Black Organization deals and Gin had a camera; in the Special they both use their phones's cameras instead.\n- In the manga, Gin uses a metal rod to knock out Shinichi. Whereas in this version he uses his retractable walking stick, which makes more sense since such a blow to the head would have left him with more than a minor injury.\n- In both manga and anime, Gin just places the pill in Shinichi's mouth and then forces him to drink the contents of a bottle to force him consume the poison that would shrink him. In the special, he also sticks his fingers up Shinichi's mouth to make sure the pill will be swallowed.\n- Hina Wada, a character created rather recently in the manga, gets a brief scene where she apprehends a thief by herself.\n- Characters not yet created at the start of the manga (like Wataru Takagi, Kazunobu Chiba, Chianti and Korn) get cameos in the special.\n- Sewa was in a normal wheelchair in the manga and anime, whereas he uses an electronic one in the special.\n",
    "Anime to special changes": "- In the original episode 1, Yamazaki was shot in the chest. In this version, he is stabbed with a knife.\n- In the original episode 1, Yamazaki was Yatsubishi Bank president. In this version, he is Beika Bank president.\n- In the original episode 1, The evidence that caught Sewa was his hospital records that Shinichi earlier investigated instead of first meeting him at Sonoko's residence, and him noticing his foot was already healed.\n- Sewa's wife is seen alive and well. Her and Sewa's son shows up too.\n- The news castors that are talking about Shinichi as he walks by have been replaced by Rena Mizunashi and a co-host.\n- The scenes with the Detective Boys sneaking into the Mystery Coaster and finding the pearl strand were cut. Instead, Shinichi and Ran encounter them playing soccer earlier in the Special and Shinichi even plays soccer with them a little.\n- Ran and Shinichi visit Sonoko and her parents in their mansion, right before Sewa kills Yamazaki. Sewa himself is there and briefly freaks out when he realizes Shinichi's identity.\n- The karate tournament won by Ran is shown, with Hina Wada as her opponent. Additionally, both Makoto and Sonoko are seen and it's stated that this is when Makoto fell in love at first sight with Sonoko.\n- The scene with Shinichi leaping out of the way of Ran's kick from the manga is used instead of the anime version where he ends up under her skirt.\n- Instead of a shining white light censor, a dark blood fountain is seen during the decapitation scene. There's so much blood that Ran gets all stained with it.\n- The scene from the manga where Reiko suggests that Gin and Vodka could be the culprit, while Shinichi points out that they would be have been expecting the police to show up if they were guilty is included in the special.\n- Whereas original episode 2 had shrunken Shinichi fleeing from the cops immediately upon being conscious, the special follows the manga in which he is taken first to the Tropical Land medical center, before he flees from there.\n- During the flash forward, the scene where Akemi Miyano is killed is exactly like how it was in the original manga, while the anime altered this scene so that she would live, and later another episode had to be made in order to fix the plothole. However, she is wearing the clothes she wore in the later episode, rather than what she wore in the manga or first episode.\n- The scene where Shiho sees Shinichi and Ran came from Nazo.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Insert song: Unmei no Roulette Mawashite, by ZARD.\n- This special was released on June 28, 2020 by Discotek Media and is the home media debut of the Bang Zoom! Entertainment English dub. This is the first English dubbed release since The Phantom of Baker Street in 2010.\n- The subtitle of this episode \"The Great Detective Turned Small\" (Chīsakunatta Meitantei) is the same title that was used by file 002 of the manga.\n- During Yusaku and Yukiko's brief appearance, they are in their \"Night Baron\" and \"Fumiyo Edogawa\" disguise from Conan Edogawa Kidnapping Case.\n- During the scene where Eri is talking to Kogoro over the phone, a calico cat is shown lying on her desk. This is Eri's previous cat that is mentioned in file 528, it had died a month earlier off screen resulting in her taking in Goro from a friend. Since this Special takes place before that, her first cat is still alive.\n- The number Ran bears during the karate tournament is \"910\", which can also be read as \"Kudo\" in Japanese.\n- On the cover of file 984 Ran's texts for Shinichi are the exact same structure and content that were on Ran's note in this special: the note she left for him after their date at Tropical Land in, the one where Shiho finds with a picture of Shinichi and Ran.\n- The car of the man in the bar is a atomic silver Lexus RC 350 F Sport although the logo is modified to avoid product placement.\n",
