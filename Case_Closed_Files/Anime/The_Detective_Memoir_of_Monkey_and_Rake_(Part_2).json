    "Situation": "Kogoro and Conan are taken by Ran and Sonoko to a Rooster Festival at the Ranburi Shrine. Ran and Sonoko sneak off to have their love fortunes predicted. Sonoko reads Ran's fortune which strongly suggests her to be feminine and avoid mannish conducts. Sonoko is then robbed by a man wearing a hyottoko mask who flees with her purse towards Ran. Ran, hesitant by her love fortune, does not incapacitate him with karate and allows him to escape. Kogoro explains the man has been dubbed as the Rooster Man and is a serial robber at Rooster Festivals. Ran and Sonoko takes Conan with them to visit the festival again to have their love fortunes retold. A woman's scream is heard and they discover that the Rooster Man was spotted and stabbed a man before escaping.\n\nBefore losing consciousness, the stabbed man, Shiro Masuko, tells Conan its not rooster but saru and shows him nine fingers. Conan investigates the backpack left behind by the Rooster Man and discovers all the possessions stolen by him. The police arrive and are able to narrow down the Rooster Man to three suspects after witnessing him run into the bathroom. Ran finds a button belonging to the Rooster Man from her previous encounter and has the police investigate which suspect is the owner of the button.\nIt was discovered the button did not belong to any of the suspects.\n",

Masuko had originally become the Rooster Man in order to blow off the stress from his rigorous university entry exams.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Conan on the conclusion actually verbally explains the case to Kogoro and Sonoko instead of using his gadgets as usual, but he still somehow convinces them that they have the credit on the case's solution.\n- The suspects' names come from \"Chinese zodiac\"[1] :\nTatsuo Hino (火野 辰男) comes from Hinoetatsu (丙辰), the 53rd year in the Chinese zodiac sexagenary cycle ;\nHisami Sarukawa (猿川 久巳) comes from \"monkey\" (申 ,saru?) and \"snake\" (巳 ,mi?), two zodiac signs ;\nShiro Masuko (益子 士郎) comes from \"horse\" (午 ,uma (ma)?) and \"rat\" (子 ,shi?), two zodiac signs, as well as the ten heavenly stems (十干) ;\nShinji Mizunoe (水江 申次) comes from \"Jinshin\" (壬申), 9th year in the sexagenary cycle.\n- Tatsuo Hino (火野 辰男) comes from Hinoetatsu (丙辰), the 53rd year in the Chinese zodiac sexagenary cycle ;\n- Hisami Sarukawa (猿川 久巳) comes from \"monkey\" (申 ,saru?) and \"snake\" (巳 ,mi?), two zodiac signs ;\n- Shiro Masuko (益子 士郎) comes from \"horse\" (午 ,uma (ma)?) and \"rat\" (子 ,shi?), two zodiac signs, as well as the ten heavenly stems (十干) ;\n- Shinji Mizunoe (水江 申次) comes from \"Jinshin\" (壬申), 9th year in the sexagenary cycle.\n- Sawako's name comes from Sawako Kuronuma (黒沼 爽子), a character in the manga Kimi ni Todoke.\n- Tatsuo Hino (火野 辰男) comes from Hinoetatsu (丙辰), the 53rd year in the Chinese zodiac sexagenary cycle ;\n- Hisami Sarukawa (猿川 久巳) comes from \"monkey\" (申 ,saru?) and \"snake\" (巳 ,mi?), two zodiac signs ;\n- Shiro Masuko (益子 士郎) comes from \"horse\" (午 ,uma (ma)?) and \"rat\" (子 ,shi?), two zodiac signs, as well as the ten heavenly stems (十干) ;\n- Shinji Mizunoe (水江 申次) comes from \"Jinshin\" (壬申), 9th year in the sexagenary cycle.\n",
