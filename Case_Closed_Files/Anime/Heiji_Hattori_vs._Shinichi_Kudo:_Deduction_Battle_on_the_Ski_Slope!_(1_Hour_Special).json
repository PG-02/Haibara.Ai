    "Situation": "Heiji tells Conan that he met a better detective than Conan during middle school and reminisces about the case three years ago. At Yamagata Zao Onsen Ski Resort, an actor named Shohei Minowa is murdered in the same fashion as his old stunt performer, Jiro Mizugami, who was murdered four years ago at the same resort.\n\n\n",
    "People": "- Victim (gunshot)\n- 32 years old (3 years ago)\n- Actor\n- 56 years old (3 years ago)\n- Movie director\n- 27 years old (3 years ago)\n- Stuntman\n- 31 years old (3 years ago)\n- Make-up specialist\n- 35 years old (3 years ago)\n- Private detective\n- Former detective from Yamagata Prefectural Police\n- Deceased (gunshot)\n- 31 years old (7 years ago)\n- Stuntman\n- Rikuto's childhood friend\n- Inspector from Yamagata Prefectural Police\n- Detective from Yamagata Prefectural Police\n- 14 years old (3 years ago)\n- Kazuha's friend\n- Kaihou Academy student\n- 14 years old (3 years ago)\n- Kazuha's friend\n- Kaihou Academy student\n- 14 years old (3 years ago)\n- Kazuha's friend\n- Kaihou Academy student\n- 14 years old (3 years ago)\n- Kazuha's friend\n- Kaihou Academy student\n- 14 years old (3 years ago)\n- Kaihou Academy student\n- Heiji and Kazuha's friend\n- 14 years old (3 years ago)\n- Kaihou Academy student\n- Heiji and Kazuha's friend\n- 14 years old (3 years ago)\n- Kaihou Academy student\n- Heiji and Kazuha's friend\n- Kaihou Academy teacher\n- Shohei's fan\n- Shohei's fan\n- Shohei's fan\n- Shohei's fan\n- Shohei's fan\n- Ski station employee\n- Lift staff\n",
    "Resolution": "- In the movie previously filmed here, the ski scene had a continuity goof with Minowa's close-up immediately after.\n- The bag that was filled with snow has a very long carry-strap and can be purchased in multiple sizes at the resort souvenir shop.\n- The ski lift gets within a few feet of the snow at two places on the slope.\n- Mimata still has Minowa's clothes on underneath his jacket.\nHeiji and the unknown detective, revealed to viewers as Shinichi, investigate and realize separately how the murder occurred after receiving a hint from their respective fathers. Heiji reveals his deductions to the police in person while Shinichi tells them over the phone. They both reveal that the Minowa who skied for his fans was actually his stunt double, Kosuke Mimata, in disguise. Minowa had hidden in a bag Mimata picked up at the base of the slope, to provide his voice for the watching fans. On the ski lift later, Mimata killed Minowa and grabbed the bag he'd prepared earlier to contain snow and have the carry-strap frozen upright where the slope was close, so his ski pole could grab the carry-strap while still on the lift. He put it in his seat before jumping down at the second area the ski lift passed close to the slope. Faced with the evidence, Mimata confesses.\n- Mimata killed Minowa in revenge for Mizugami, whom Minowa had killed four years ago.\n- Minowa had used the same trick that Mimata used to kill Mizugami, which explains why the murders were so alike.\n- Minowa killed Mizugami because he'd been afraid Mizugami would reveal that Minowa did not perform the skiing scenes in his movies.\nBoth Shinichi and Heiji are congratulated, but they are each not satisfied that the other apparently solved the case without needing a hint. While Heiji explains this to Kazuha, as he carries her back to the lodge due to her sprained ankle, they pass Shinichi explaining the same thing to Ran. Heiji and Shinichi recognize each other as detectives, and privately anticipate meeting again in the future.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Mimata's weapon kills Minowa, same kill Jiro four years ago, is a Tokarev TT-33.\n- This case is the fifteenth 1 hour special, not counting reruns.\n- Although this case has the same opening and closing songs as the previous three cases, this case, like those other three cases, have unique animation, which pertains to this case only for the opening and closing songs.\n- This case revealed that Shizuka Hattori has a rather large and extensive video collection of Heiji, beginning from when he was born, and is still growing.\n- In this case, Shizuka Hattori had a run in with Yukiko Kudo, although they may never have exchanged names.\n- The TV special Black History 2 was a retelling of this case.\n"
