    "Situation": "Sonoko visits Kenzo Ukishima's house today, whom she will come to ask to make a catalogue for the potteries that Jirokichi Suzuki had bought a few days ago, with Conan following her because Ran has gone shopping and he has nothing else to do. At that time, Ukishima, who is holding the bandaged cat, invites the two into the house, Sonoko also brings the gift that Jirokichi has given him as a greeting.\nWe learn that today is the day that Ukishima moved his things to prepare for the reorganization of his work due to health issues, with some of the items not being wrapped because a collector named Munetake Sawada had bought them. However, while Ukishima opens the window, the cat almost causes some of the pottery to shatter, luckily Conan and Sonoko react in time. But the truth is that a pottery vase had been broken before the two of them arrived here.\nSawada suddenly arrives at this time, and after seeing the broken vase, he becomes extremely angry and threatens to sue Ukishima and almost causes a fight, fortunately Conan uses the stun-gun wristwatch on him to ease the tension. Everyone continues to discuss the vase issue, even using security footage to increase the persuasiveness, from which Conan is able to clearly understand the truth of the matter.\n",
