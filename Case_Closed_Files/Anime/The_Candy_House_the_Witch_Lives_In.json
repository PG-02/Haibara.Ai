    "Situation": "Sonoko take Ran and Conan to the \"Candy House\" in the Ecriture. In there, Conan meets a group of three masters who make pastries and puddings: Tsuyoshi Maeda the \"Iron Pastry\" Chief, Yasuo Fujino the \"Prince of Pastries\", and Yumi Morimoto the \"Candy Magician\". They taste the sweets that the three chefs made, which are very delicious. Later, they suddenly hear a scream.\n\nThe suspects all have motives for murdering Hashigaki, but Morimoto becomes the prime suspect as she is the only one who stayed inside the Ecriture.\n",
    "People": "- 28 years old\n- Pastry chef\n- 30 years old\n- Pastry chef\n- 26 years old\n- Pastry chef\n- Victim (beaten)\n- 45 years old\n- Ecriture owner\n- Tokyo MPD, Division 1, detective\n",
    "Resolution": "Fujino murdered Hashigaki by using a wooden log. He got the inspiration for this plan from the design of the Candy House. The house looks as though you can eat it, but in reality, the house is an ordinary wooden house outfitted with a candy surface to give the illusion that the entire house is edible.\nFirst, he hid a log that was slightly smaller than an ordinary chocolate cake roll in the kitchen. He then hid the log under the tray which was carrying Conan's cake by supporting it with his hand. When he arrived near to Hashigaki, he took advantage of the blind spot that was present between them and Morimoto's kitchen to swing the log at Hashigaki. Furthermore, he swung at Hashigaki while Morimoto was using the blender which negated any noise that the victim might make.\nAfterwards, he inserted the log from the side into Conan's cake in order to hide the murder weapon. He then walked out of the Candy House calmly to present Conan with the cake. The evidence was on Fujino's display stand. On the display stand, the cake with the log in it was still present, and when it was cut, the log was found.\n",

    "Quotes": "- Conan Edogawa:\nShattering his dream of starting a business, and taking away the wood chocolate cake roll which has been with him from the start. The owner was exactly like the witch in \"Hansel and Gretel\", who lured children into the forest to eat them.  (独立の夢をたたれ、自分とともに歩んで来たウッドチョコも取り上げられた彼にとって。店長は『ヘンゼルとグレーテル』同様、自分を檻に閉じ込め取って食おうとしている魔女だったのだろう。)\n",
