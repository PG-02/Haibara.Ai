    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Sato is having an arranged marriage meeting with a man due to her mother's persistence. She arrives to find out it's Ninzaburo Shiratori. She proposes that if Takagi does not arrive to her before sunset, she will marry him whether she wants to or not. He accepts, but Takagi is busy with a store robbery.\n\nThree of the eye witnesses all give different description and the three suspects are kept in the back of the police car. Conan gives help using his gadget. The witnesses are an old man who accidentally got bumped by the running suspect, a teen girl who is a shopper at the store where the crime happens, and a restaurant owner who also notices the suspect running near his restaurant. The suspect is wearing a coat and helmet. After they robbed at the store, they run very fast outside and escapes. Takagi follows them to a restroom where the coat and helmet are leave unattended but inside the restroom, there are three suspects. Which of them is the real one?\nThere are three witnesses who each give different accounts of the robber.\nAn old man who bumped into the robber said the robber was a woman in blue. A woman in a store said the robber was a man in green over 180 cm tall. A café owner wearing glasses said a person in black 170 cm tall.\n",
    "People": "- 21 years old\n- Freelancer\n- 28 years old\n- Office worker\n- 32 years old\n- School coach\n- Retiree\n- Shopping girl\n",
    "Resolution": "",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- After being told by Mamehara that the culprit was wearing a coat over black clothes and height being 5'6, Takagi thinks of Kamieda who is of that height, but not wearing black clothing. Immediately after in the manga, he thinks of the other accounts given by the other two witnesses, with the anime cutting off after considering Kamieda.\n- File 328 ends with Sato agreeing to Shiratori's deal. File 329 follows up immediately with her specifying that Takagi is given until sunset to pick her up, with Conan, Ran, Sonoko, and Araide commenting on their discussion. Episode 253 switches that scene to follow Takagi and Chiba's reflection on the robbery clues given to them by the witnesses and deciding to question the suspects.\n- Unlike the manga, part 2 of the episode in the anime shows Takagi recapping the robbery, the suspects and the witnesses to Conan, who's calling as Shinichi.\n",
    "Continuity": "- This is the case that referred to Miwako telling Shiratori that she did not like French Food, which was in Metropolitan Police Detective Love Story, when in reality, she did not like expensive food, which is what she said to Takagi in that case. However, they are at a (probably expensive) Japanese restaurant in this case.\n- When Shiratori made a comment about Takagi receiving a pay-cut before, it was in the The Shinkansen Transport Case, however he neglected to mention that she received the same pay cut.\n- When Conan mentioned that he knows Mamehara, probably as one of the witnesses in The Girl from the Black Organization and the University Professor Murder Case.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Mrs. Sato is trying to do an Omiai, an arranged marriage, but instead of going through a liaison or marriage broker, she is making Miwako Sato look at photos of the prospective husband. Omiai is still being used by 5 to 6% of the Japanese people.\n- The Spanish dub mistook the title of the episodes, \"Metropolitan Police Detective Love Story 4\", for \"Love story between 4 metropolitan police detectives\".\n- Miwako Sato hatchback is a Wolkengrau 1995 Volkswagen Polo III [Typ 6N].\n",
