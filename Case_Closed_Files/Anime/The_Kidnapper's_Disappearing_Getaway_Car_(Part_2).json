    "Situation": "Conan and the Detective Boys are visiting to their friend named Jun Kataoka. Later, Conan is kidnapped by a man named Tadashi Yoshizawa.\n\nThe kidnapper takes Conan to his hideout and locked him up in the old room. While locked in, Conan manages to bend lose a rusted old iron pipe belonging to the stairway railing to the door out. While first using the pipe on the door, Conan realizes his body lacks the strength to batter the door open and bends open an iron grating of a ventilation shack and crawls his way to freedom through it. Meanwhile the kidnapper picks up the ransom and manages to get away shortly before the Detective Boys with Jun returns from the arcade to his house to find the police there.\nAfter Conan escaped the kidnapper, he told Inspector Megure everything that happened. Then after the kidnappers escape, the vehicle is finally found with Tadashi Yoshizawa murdered inside.\n\n",
