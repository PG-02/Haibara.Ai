    "Situation": "While Kogoro and the group are watching a news report on a recent bank robbery, Amuro stops by with sandwiches from Café Poirot after finishing his part time job for the day. After commenting on the robbery, Amuro reveals that he wants the scoop on Kogoro's newest case request after deducing from Kogoro's appearance and habits that Kogoro had a case. Kogoro gets a text from the client requesting that Kogoro switch the meeting location to Café Columbo, and Amuro goes with them after changing out of his work clothes.\nAt Columbo, Kogoro explains to Amuro the request was to find the locker a key belongs to. The client fails to show, so Amuro, Kogoro, Conan, and Ran go back to the Mouri Detective Agency to make sure the client didn't actually turn up there instead. When Amuro arrives at the agency, he and Conan notice someone had broken in and appeared to have intercepted the client while they were out. Stepping outside, Amuro explains his deductions to the rest of the gang and that the culprit is hiding in the restroom. Before Amuro can open the bathroom door, a gunshot rings out, and Conan rushes in to find a dead man who apparently committed suicide with a gun and a taped-up crying woman.\n\nThe group escort Kei Kashitsuka back to her condo. Kei goes to tidy up her room but secretly leaves the condo with Conan following her. While Kogoro, Ran and Amuro are waiting for Kei, they start searching for listening devices as when Masumi called Ran the former's voice wasn't clearly audible.\n\nLater they receive an email from Kei Kashitsuka that orders them not to attempt to find her or she won't guarantee Conan's safety.\n\nRan contacted Agasa for help while Kogoro and Amuro discovered more information.\n\nKogoro, Ran and Amuro try to unlock the PC in Kei's apartment while Subaru, Agasa and Haibara are on their way to follow Conan. Afterwards, Kogoro and the two unlock the PC. In the middle of Kei driving, Conan wakes up, having in fact tricked her into believing that he was unconscious, and tells Kei that he can help her find the woman in the group, the last of the robbers. Surprised by Conan, she asked how did he wake up, to which Conan answered that he purposely spilt the juice because there was no *pop* sound when he opened the cap, implying that is was already opened and that Kei might have put something in it before handing it to him, thus pretending to sleep. After some time of talk between him and Kei, during which he makes her promise she won't kill the last one, they went to the apartments of the three women who were in the phonebook of the man who committed suicide at Mouri's detective agency. Sera also follows Kogoro discreetly and is seen by Amuro.\nConan figures out who amongst the three women is the third robber.\n",
    "People": "- Kogoro's client\n- Victim (gunshot)\n- Victim (beaten)\n- Deceased (gunshot)\n- Bank employee\n- 27 years old\n- Convenience store worker\n- 31 years old\n- Lottery winner\n- 29 years old\n- Writer\n- Network Today announcer\n- Network Today announcer\n- NOMO gas station clerk\n",
    "Resolution": "Conan then furthered his deduction by saying that he know that Serina will commit suicide after she murdered the third robber. Serina then accepted his condition and so he told her that the third robber's true identity is Takayo Tegawa. From the footage and information from Serina, Conan concluded that the third robber's true identity is Takayo Tegawa as both Toyokita and Furuya are right-handed (Tegawa is the only left-handed person). Tegawa's suspicious actions are also serve as an evidence, she bought beef-bowl rice to change the 10,000 yen bills number and she switched off her phone to prevent the police to find her. After the deduction Serina agreed to turn herself in but she said that one thing is wrong, she only took 2 guns from Kei Kashitsuka's hideout, alerting Conan that the third one must still in Tegawa's possession. They were later abducted by Tegawa, who used Conan as a hostage to intimidate Serina. Since Tegawa held Conan's wrist tightly, he was unable to use the stun-gun wristwatch.\n\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- Due to the fact that these four episodes were adapted from only five manga chapters, to fill in the timing, the anime version of the case was included with a few additional scenes that were not from the original manga. One of such scenes showed Subaru waiting for Agasa and Ai inside of his car in front of Agasa's house, before they started moving. He was shown secretly listening to something with a device, and immediately hid it when the two people came out. It was never explained what exactly he was listening to. Aside from this, there were also some small additional dialogues during the whole case that weren't originated from the manga.\n- In the manga version, right before Amuro crashed his car, Amuro told Kogoro to put on his seatbelt in the backseat. In the anime version, Kogoro was already wearing his seatbelt, so Amuro told him to stay as he is.\n- Color changes:\nIn the manga Kei Kashitsuka's hair is brown, while in the anime it is black.\nIn the manga Subaru's car is white-colored, but it is changed into red in the anime, which may be a possible reference to Shuichi Akai. (Akai means red in Japanese)\nIn the manga Vermouth's cellphone is black, but it is changed into white in the anime.\nIn the manga Amuro's cellphone is white, but it is changed into black in the anime.\n- In the manga Kei Kashitsuka's hair is brown, while in the anime it is black.\n- In the manga Subaru's car is white-colored, but it is changed into red in the anime, which may be a possible reference to Shuichi Akai.

    "Trivia": "- During the search for listening bugs, there was a phone ringtone and the song played was Kimi no Namida ni Konna ni Koi Shiteru by Natsuiro, which is also the current opening theme of the series.\n- This case was adapted in an animanga that was released on December 18, 2017.\n- Kei Kashitsuka's vehicle is a pastel blue metallic 2004 Suzuki Swift (ZC11S).\n- The suspects' names are related to \"banks\"[1] :\nKei Kashitsuka (樫塚 圭) comes from loans (貸付 ,kashitsuke?) ;\nSerina Urakawa (浦川 芹奈) comes from money orders/exchanges (為替 ,kawase?) ;\nKen'ya Shono (庄野 賢也) comes from securities/bonds (証券 ,shōken?) ;\nRinko Toyokita (豊北 倫子) comes from deposits (預金 ,yokin?) and interest rates (金利 ,kinri?) ;\nSakae Furuya (降屋 栄絵) comes from transfers (振替 ,furikae?) ;\nTakayo Tegawa (手川 隆代) comes from bills (手形 ,tegata?) ;\nMoreover, Ōishi Highway (王石街道, literally \"king-stone highway\"), comes from the former city of Kingston upon Thames, now a suburb of London.\n- Kei Kashitsuka (樫塚 圭) comes from loans (貸付 ,kashitsuke?) ;\n- Serina Urakawa (浦川 芹奈) comes from money orders/exchanges (為替 ,kawase?) ;\n- Ken'ya Shono (庄野 賢也) comes from securities/bonds (証券 ,shōken?) ;\n- Rinko Toyokita (豊北 倫子) comes from deposits (預金 ,yokin?) and interest rates (金利 ,kinri?) ;\n- Sakae Furuya (降屋 栄絵) comes from transfers (振替 ,furikae?) ;\n- Takayo Tegawa (手川 隆代) comes from bills (手形 ,tegata?) ;\n- Moreover, Ōishi Highway (王石街道, literally \"king-stone highway\"), comes from the former city of Kingston upon Thames, now a suburb of London.\n- Kei Kashitsuka (樫塚 圭) comes from loans (貸付 ,kashitsuke?) ;\n- Serina Urakawa (浦川 芹奈) comes from money orders/exchanges (為替 ,kawase?) ;\n- Ken'ya Shono (庄野 賢也) comes from securities/bonds (証券 ,shōken?) ;\n- Rinko Toyokita (豊北 倫子) comes from deposits (預金 ,yokin?) and interest rates (金利 ,kinri?) ;\n- Sakae Furuya (降屋 栄絵) comes from transfers (振替 ,furikae?) ;\n- Takayo Tegawa (手川 隆代) comes from bills (手形 ,tegata?) ;\n- Moreover, Ōishi Highway (王石街道, literally \"king-stone highway\"), comes from the former city of Kingston upon Thames, now a suburb of London.\n",
