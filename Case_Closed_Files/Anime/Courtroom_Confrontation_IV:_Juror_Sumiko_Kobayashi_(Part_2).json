    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "A murder case court is in session in which Toshio Iwamatsu is suspected of having killed Tadashi Ishigaki after burglarizing his home office.\n\nWhile Iwamatsu admits the break-in, he vehemently denies the murder, even though a slip-up suggests that he might have been acquainted with Ishigaki. The case heralds yet another confrontation between Eri Kisaki, as Iwamatsu's attorney, and Reiko Kujo as the prosecutor. In addition, Sumiko Kobayashi has been selected as one of the jurors. Although nervous, she keeps the court's confidence and refuses to devulge any details to the pestering Detective Boys members Ayumi, Mitsuhiko, and Genta.\nAt first the trial appears to be inconclusive, as there is no practical evidence of Iwamatsu being guilty of the murder. However, on a crime scene photo Kobayashi-sensei notices that the picture in Ishigaki's office - a rather odd piece of art of which a copy is also hanging in the Teitan Elementary principal's office - is actually situated pointing upside down. Intrigued, Conan, Ran, and Kogoro investigate the scene, along with Kujo, and on the back of the painting they discover bloodstains and an IOU for a large sum of money made out to Iwamatsu, which would provide a motive for murder. But Conan notices two more peculiarities: the imprint of a vase on a nearby cabinet, but with the vase gone, and the strange nervousness of Ishigaki's housekeeper, Yukie Hara.\n",
    "People": "- 35 years old\n- Defendant\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- Moneylender\n- Real estate company president\n- 66 years old\n- Housekeeper\n- 46 years old\n- Tadashi's brother-in-law\n- Tokyo Supreme Court side judge\n- Juror\n- Juror\n- Juror\n- Juror\n- Juror\n",
    "Resolution": "Right after Ishigaki was killed, however, Iwamatsu came, so Tsukano hung the painting up again (failing to notice in his haste that it was now upside down) and hid behind the door. Iwamatsu recoiled in shock upon finding the corpse and accidentally knocked the vase onto the floor, and Tsukano took advantage of it by hiding the knife inside. When Iwamatsu had fled the scene and the housekeeper, who had heard Iwamatsu hitting the ground, rushed to the crime scene, Tsukano decided to pretend that he had just arrived, and checked the victim so that he would have an excuse for the blood on his hands.\nAfter Mrs. Hara had left to call the police and the ambulance, Tsukano took the vase to the garbage collection site outside, hoping that it would get collected and disappear. But unfortunately it didn't, so he decided to take the knife and the gloves out of it and throw it in the park pool. But while removing the murder weapon from the vase, he left blooded fingerprints inside, which became the crucial evidence about him being the culprit.\n",
