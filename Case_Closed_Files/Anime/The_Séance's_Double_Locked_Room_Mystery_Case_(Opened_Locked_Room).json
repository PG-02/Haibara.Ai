    "Situation": "Conan, Ran, and Kogoro knocked on a mansion door at night as they were lost. The door is open and a man in a hood is seen which makes them scream. They see behind the mysterious man more people dressed like him. One of them notices Kogoro and shows himself as Koji Yatsukawa. They are allowed to come in and everyone tells Kogoro who they are. Hirasaka tells them that they will be holding a séance for their idol, who was supposed to be a star in the Black Magic Girl Movie. They decided to hold a séance as rumors have come up saying if people ditched the club, they will be suffered with illness. They also brought up a murder who was supposed to be related to the death of Kira. So they decided to have the séance to ask Kira herself.\n\nDuring the séance, they call out to Kira and voices of her coming out from the paintings around them telling them that one of them here has killed her and she shall have her vengeance. Soon the tables start shaking and things start breaking. Kogoro deducts that the person moving these objects (from a remote control) was Hirasaka which is proven to be right. He claims it was just a little performance but says that someone switched the audio as thats not what he put on the tape. Soon after Hirasaka and Honogi are in a room talking to each other. It seems that Honogi did or saw something a while ago. While eating with some other guests Conan asks questions about Kira and the previous murder. They learn the person who saw the body was Shouko. When they call her cellphone to see if she will talk to Kogoro a bit she says she has a headache and not now.\n\nLater that night when everyone is sleeping. The club members get a message saying \"I have returned to life\" ~Kira from Shouko's phone. After breaking into the meditation room she is on the table dead.\n\nConan quickly notices that this was a sealed door murder. Yutaka than lets out an evil laugh saying \"Kira has returned.\"\nHonogi reveals that he discovered Hirasaka in his room dead. Kogoro breaks open the room and confirms Hirasaka died from drinking poisoned wine.\n\nThe police arrive at the mansion where Kogoro shows them both locked rooms. In the séance room, Kogoro explains that the front door was padlocked from the inside and the only way out is through high window. The high window can only be opened with a switch in the room. In Hirasaka's room, a small window is found above the door but too small to fit a person through. On the floor of the room were the ripped posters of Kira from the séance room. The keys to both rooms were found in Hirasaka's drawer. The police interview the club members and discover Hirasaka, Honogi, and Sawanami have received threatening messages from a fan of Kira and their goal with the séance was to find the culprit. They deduce that the one sending the messages, swapped the recording, is the same person who committed the murders. Takagi shows Kogoro and Conan Sawanami's dying message written as キラ; Conan then discovers the identity of the culprit.\nConan investigates the two rooms one last time and brings Kogoro to the séance room and tranquilizes him.\n",

    "Resolution": "Kira's killer was Reiki Hirasaka, who was a very heavy drinker due to depression. They were in a party in the mansion and at some point he got too drunk, so when Kira tried to calm him down he shoved her causing her to fall and land on her head and dying from the impact and suffering a fatal concussion. He and the other people in the party then set up everything to make everyone believe she had died in an accident instead, hiding her body in the mansion.\n\nMifune had started to target the people who were known to have been with Kira the day she died. He first attacked Sawanami, being the one with the lowest guard. In regards to Hirasaka, Mifune killed him by poisoning his wine; the proof of it were some wine stains on his shirt, hidden under his tie. He also wanted to kill Honogi first, but then changed his mind and killed Shouko before him...\nFinally, there are two \"reasons\" why Shouko Utakura was killed.\n- Mifune thought Shouko was the girl who was at the party that ended with Kira's death (Sawanami had mentioned a female, but didn't say her name): but it wasn't her. It actually was Maho Izumi, the cosplayer. She didn't come forward due to the trauma she had gone through when the kind-hearted Kira, who befriended her when nobody would and saved her from ending up as a hikikomori (house recluse), had died. She also ended up explaining to Mifune why Shouko committed the second mistake that would get her killed.\n- Shouko found Sawanami's lifeless body and, thanks to the kana he spelled in his own blood before dying, deduced that Mifune was the one who attacked him. She later confronted Mifune by saying she knew the truth, but adding that she would cover up for him. Shouko was in love with Mifune and truly meant what she said, and not to mention she had decided to not tell him that she loved him since she knew he still loved Kira. When they spoke, however, Mifune misunderstood her and thought she'd blackmail him, so as soon as he could he strangled Shouko to silence her. Shouko didn't fight back because, upon being attacked by the guy she loved, the poor girl fell in despair and lost the will to live.\nMifune shocked by this revelation and realizing his mistake repeatedly bashes his head into the floor in despair before being stopped by Chiba. Later on it is revealed that Kira’s body had finally been found in the seance room after the police dug it up.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is the first anime original case that has a length of three episodes.\n- Hirasaka mansion reappears in a Baba mansion's painting from The Fortuneteller and the Three Customers.\n- Kira Miyahara's car is a 2006 dark blue BMW Z4 Coupé [E86].\n- Many paintings in Hirasaka mansion are the same in Kisaki law office from Courtroom Confrontation III: Prosecutor as Eyewitness, in the tea house from The Alibi of the Black Dress, in Shizuoka Sea Side Hotel from The Worst Birthday, and in Kobo Inn from The Scenario of the Steaming Locked Room.
