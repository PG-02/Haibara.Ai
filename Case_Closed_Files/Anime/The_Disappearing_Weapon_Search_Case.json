    "Situation": "The Detective Boys are walking to a beauty salon, because Ayumi wants to get a haircut from her favorite hairdresser. However, they see her hairdresser, Mika Mitsui, arguing with the owner of the salon, Midori Goto, an argument that gets heated. Mitsui wants to leave the salon, and join a different one. However, the owner keeps begging for her to stay, because she believes that the hairdresser is the best one in the salon. Mitsui tells Ayumi that even though she is leaving the salon, that she can still get her hair done anytime she wants. She tells Ayumi to visit her apartment on Saturday morning, to get her hair done. The next Saturday, the Detective Boys go to the hairdresser's apartment, but find that she has been murdered.\n\nMegure, Takagi, and Tome visit the apartment to investigate. She had been strangled, and a piece of blue plastic was found in her fingernail. Also, two pieces of dry cleaning were found, and one of the pieces of dry cleaning was missing its wire hanger. After the brief investigation, the owner of the salon is invited to identify the body. Conan notices her looking suspicious, and also notices that she keeps looking at the garbage in the apartment, as well as outside of the apartment. He also notices she has a large bandage on her hand. Conan deduces that the missing coat hanger is the murder weapon, and notifies the police. Megure and Conan both believe that the owner of the salon is the murderer, however, they cannot find the murder weapon.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (strangled)\n- 24 years old\n- Beautician\n- 39 years old\n- Midori Beauty Salon manager\n- Midori Beauty Salon hairdresser\n- Cleaning company worker\n- Cleaning company owner\n- Tokyo MPD CSI officer\n- Park keeper\n",
    "Resolution": "- Evidence\nConan believes that due to the salon owner continuously looking at all garbage, that maybe she had thrown out the murder weapon. Megure, Takagi, and the police force are all told by Conan to look at the garbage bags that are found lying on the street, as the garbage had not been collected just yet. However, no murder weapon is found in any of the garbage bags, and at that time the investigation is briefly halted. Later, the Detective Boys are walking along, and find some crows. The Detective Boys realize that bird like city crows and magpies often look through garbage to find things for their nest, including wire and hangers. After a heavy amount of searching, Conan discovers a crow nest with the specific wire on it on a telephone pole, and notifies Megure.\n- Conclusion\nConan, Haibara, and the Detective Boys attend outside, while Megure and Takagi confront Midori Goto, who finally admits to the murder. She received the cut on her arm after Mitsui threw the wire hanger at her, frustrated from the owner constantly asking her to come back. Goto then lost control, and strangled her to death with the coat hanger, the piece of plastic under Mitsui's nail being from her trying to remove the coat hanger. The salon owner is then arrested.\n"
