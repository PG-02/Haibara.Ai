    "Situation": "Kogoro is hired by the Torada family to solve the murder of Yoshiro Torada. Yoshiro was swept away by a tornado and was found by an unknown culprit, who instead of helping him, left a dead centipede beside Yoshiro and left him to die. They believe the culprit is from the Tatsuo family, a family whom they share a mutual hatred for.\n\nAt the same time, Heiji is hired by the Tatsuo family to investigate the death of their son, Koji Tatsuo, who was found buried under a pile of rocks, bludgeoned to death, and had a dead centipede placed beside his body. It was placed there, meaning that someone found him dying, but refused to help him.\n\nDuring the investigation, Conan, Heiji, run into a third detective named Kansuke Yamato who is investigating the same case. Their investigations lead them to believe the victims and serial killer are somehow related to an incident six years ago, where a respectable officer name Kuroto Kai was found dead during his mounted archery practice. They learn that Kai's body, which sustained injuries from falling off a cliff, died of emaciation which means he was still alive after his fall and that someone left him to die.\n\nThat night, Ran and Kazuha spot the shadow of a moving Takeda Shingen armor. When Ayaka Tatsuo, hears of this, she becomes hysterical and locks herself in the bathroom. Moments later, Ayaka is found hanged on a tree with a gag around her mouth and a dead centipede under her body.\n\nThey learn from the Tatsuo family that the centipedes are a reference to Takeda Shingen's soldiers which were referred to as, \"The Centipedes\". The families also revealed that the three victims along with Akira Tatsuo and Shigetsugu Torada were digging around and searching for Takeda Shingen's legendary treasure. Conan and Heiji's investigations lead them to believe the murderer is following the Furinkazan and that the next culprit shall die in a death related to fire. Elsewhere, Shigetsugu combusts into flames near a railroad track.\n\nKansuke Yamato reveals that Shigetsugu hooked his fishing rod onto the railroads power lines resulting in his death. He shows them Shigetsugu's diary which explains that the four victims were the cause of Kuroto Kai's death and deduces that Shigetsugu was the culprit who murdered the three victims before committing suicide. Conan and Heiji investigate Ayaka's crime scene and learn from the forensic team that Ayaka's hand had blue eye liner on it and realize who the true murderer is.\n",

    "Resolution": "She alse reveals there were two more lines to the Furinkazan, the lines referring to shadow and lightning; She reveals that Shigetsugu's death was lightning, Kai's was shadow, and Akira will be fire in order to complete the Furinkazan. She explains that the blue eyeliner on Ayaka's hand was a dying message; The kanji for blue was referring to dark bay, meaning a dark horse and the one riding a dark horse was Tatsue.\nShe explains that Tatsue wants to murder Akira, because she is involved in a betting business concerning the archery. If Akira never missed a shot during his mounted archery, no one would want to bet. Tatsue confesses to all the murders including Kai's death and her plans to murder Akira. Kai's death had been for the same reason, since he, like Akira, had never missed a shot. She reveals that she simply fired her gun at the horse’s feet causing both Kai and his horse to plunge to their deaths.\nShe also reveals how those who she killed felt like they had caused Kai’s death. Heiji, Conan, and Kansuke who were waiting to ambush Tatsue reveal themselves and apprehend her.\n\nHopefully, her gang is disarmed since many unexpected people appears to have known the truth and confronted her: Heiji, Conan and inspector Yamato who arrive to take the criminals down and as always, Conan gets the best part by shooting his soccer ball at the boss (Tatsue). She flies to the wall in front of Shigeyo and her son and the criminals are arrested by the Police officer and his assistants.\n- Criminal\n- Involved in Tatsue's gang\n- Criminal\n- Involved in Tatsue's gang\n- Criminal\n- Involved in Tatsue's gang\n- Criminal\n- Involved in Tatsue's gang\n- Criminal\n- Involved in Tatsue's gang\n- Criminal\n- Involved in Tatsue's gang\n- Criminal\n- Involved in Tatsue's gang\n",
