    "Situation": "After Kogoro and Conan take down a would-be bank robber, they head off to Kogoro's 15-year class reunion with Ran in Tochigi Prefecture. Kogoro's old friends were all on the state-winning Judo team together, but when the beautiful Yumi Horikoshi turns up in her room dead of an apparent suicide, the fun is abruptly ended.\n\n\nKogoro's class reunion continues, but all the catching up has finally caught up to the classmates leaving one of them dead. Is the killer still among them, and if so, can Conan apprehend him in time? Everyone's a suspect in this exciting episode.\n",

    "Resolution": "Unfortunately, what Nakamichi didn't count on was accelerated rigor mortis, caused by exercising before dying; he played ping-pong with Yumi before killing her, but had to leave the room to make up an alibi when Conan and Ran were drawing close. Because Yumi held a ping-pong racket with her index finger pointing out, it was impossible to move it around to the trigger of the gun once rigor mortis settled in. Another fact was that when he shot her it was from a distance as a result there was no burn mark or gunshot residue around the entry wound, which meant that she did not kill herself.\nConan was about to tranquilize Kogoro to expose Nakamichi, but when he was about to do so, he heard Kogoro talking to himself about how angry he was at the idea of one of his beloved friends being a killer, then swearing to resolve the case no matter what. Conan was so moved by Kogoro's sincerity that instead of making him sleep, he limited himself to giving him the hints he needed to fully uncover Nakamichi's guilt. One of these was Conan mentioning a statue of the legendary Musashibō Benkei, a warrior who died while on his standing on his feet. That great hero made Kogoro realize the trick that Nakamichi used to fake the time of Yumi's death.\nNakamichi admitted to being the killer, and explained why he killed Yumi, and then angrily attacked Kogoro, who then easily used a Judo throw to immobilize him. Nakamichi says Kogoro is still as strong as ever but Kogoro denies it, saying that Nakamichi has become weaker.\n",
    "Motive": "Kazushi and Yumi had been secretly dating for years, yet Yumi refused his marriage proposals no matter how many times he begged her to marry him. However, at some point Kazushi went into an omiai (arranged date) with the daughter of his boss, the two liked one another, and Kazushi decided to marry her instead. When he told Yumi about it, Yumi got so horribly jealous that she started blackmailing Nakamichi with private photos of themselves, which she threatened to send to his fiancé. Sick and tired of her interfering with his life, he made a deal with her to buy all of the photos of them together at the day of the reunion.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- The manga starts off at the reunion during the moment where Conan and Ran are bathing. The anime starts before the reunion is held with Conan and Ran trying to convince Kogoro to take them. During which a robbery takes place with Kogoro and Conan pursuing the robber. Kogoro is saved when Conan kicks the gun away from the robber. Afterwards, Kogoro, Conan, and Ran meet with Yumi who hopes to see all of them at the reunion. Meanwhile the culprit sneaks onto the scene to steal the gun used by the robber (though the culprit's not revealed until Part 2).\n",
