    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Conan, Ran, Kogoro, are at the amusement park. Later, while Yaiba is jumping on a bungee jump, the ring around his feet and he falls into the river nearby.\n\nThey identified the victim which he is Yuta Hosono. He is the performer of Kamen Yaiba. There's Akiyoshi Ishijima who operates the bungee jumping. Shinpei Okubo, who performs the Black Planet Man. Kanako Harukawa, who performs the princess. Wataru Otake, who operates props and special effects. Finally, Seizou Fujita, the show scheduler at Nichiuri Land.\n",
    "People": "- Elementary school boy\n- Kamen Yaiba's fan\n- Victim (drowned)\n- 28 years old\n- HO Theatrical Company organizer\n- Performer: Kamen Yaiba\n- 25 years old\n- Nichiuri Land bungee jumping operator\n- 28 years old\n- HO Theatrical Company member\n- Performer: Black Planet Man\n- 25 years old\n- HO Theatrical Company member\n- Performer: the Princess\n- 22 years old\n- HO Theatrical Company member\n- Props and special effects operator\n- 40 years old\n- Nichiuri Land show scheduler\n",
    "Resolution": "",
    "Evidence": "- Evidence of the explosives being used are the injuries that are on Otake's ankles. Before he jumped he placed explosives into the bungee jump ring by pretending to check to see if it was secure. However after he detonated the explosives, it left a burn mark on both his ankles proving that he was dressed as Kamen Yaiba.\n- Another piece of evidence are the poses that Kamen Yaiba did in the show differed from the usual poses he used, a child who was in the audience pointed this out. Which meant that the Kamen Yaiba in the performance was not the original actor, but was Otake instead.\n- Another piece of evidence is that when Kamen Yaiba struck his final pose, the explosives were triggered much earlier then planned. This is because the remote for the explosives was in his pocket, as a result when Otake struck the final pose he put his hand on his waist which had the remote that triggered the explosives simultaneously.\n- Another piece of evidence is the footage of the fall when Kamen Yaiba jumped into the air he had one of his hands in a fist which meant he had the detonator in that hand to trigger the explosives.\n",
    "Conclusion": "The culprit is Wataru Otake. He drowned Hosono beforehand and posed as Yaiba, and during the jump he set off the explosives himself and swam to another place to change clothes.\n",
    "Motive": "Otake reveals he did so because he felt belittled by Hosono. Otake wanted to play the role of Kamen Yaiba but Hosono said that he would not be a perfect fit for the role and that sent him over the edge. However Conan as Kogoro points out that Otake with all his jealousy could never play the hero, when Hosono pointed towards the sky as Kamen Yaiba he signified the bond between him and the children something Otake could never understand.\n",
