    "Tomorrow is There": "The Detective Boys run into a strange man named Kyozo Daita who invites them to a cake shop after stopping a thief for him. While talking with him, Conan notices the man is acting strangely.\n- 62 years old\n- Passerby\n- Retired\n- 6 years old\n- Kyozo's granddaughter\n- Kyozo's friend\n- Retired\n",
    "Hint of Red and Thirteen": "The next day, Kogoro receives an anonymous request to investigate a case involving red shirts with long sleeves. The mysterious caller requests to meet them on the third floor of a department store. At the store, the three then run into a man who explains he has been strapped with bombs.\nThe man explains he was knocked unconscious in the bathroom and found himself like that. He explains the bomber told him that if anyone leaves the floor or calls the police, the bomber will detonate the bombs in the building. He discloses the bomber's demands, to find the sender of thirteen red shirts.\n\nMeanwhile, Jodie has been searching for evidence of Akai in the department store. While Conan and Kogoro investigate, Conan discovers from the receipt that the shirts were bought on different days but always at 12:28 and that there are creases on the thirteen red shirts.\nAt the same time, the Black Organization waits outside the department store with snipers waiting for Akai. Gin holds a gun to Kir's head explaining that if Akai is alive, he will kill her. Kir said How could I have pulled any type of trick?\nShe then added, \"That is unless you're implying he or I had superhuman brainpower that allowed us to calculate that far ahead; maybe then we could have tricked you. Yes, a mind like that of Sherlock Holmes.\"\nConan arranges the red shirts in the order they were sent and folds them along the creases and deduces that the way the shirts are position reveal a code. Elsewhere, Jodie discovers that Scar Akai is on the floor where the bomb is. Conan uses the cashier room's computer in order to search for a disaster that occurred in a snowy mountain on December 28.\n\n- Man strapped with bombs\n- Sports department cashier\n- Sports department cashier\n- Missing since 13 years ago\n- Professional mountain climber\n- Hat store clerk\n- Sports department clerk\nConan reveals that the sender of the red shirt was the cashier of the sports department, Mai Seta. He explains it would be impossible to always have a shirt bought on 12:28. Seta reveals that the bomber, who is in fact Fukunishi murdered her father thirteen years ago in order to hide the fact he was embezzling money from her father's company. Conan reveals that the shirts creases are flag signals conveying the message \"I saw you burying it\". The bomber denies the murder until Conan discloses that the body must be near the cabin since the bomber was a novice at mountaineering. The bomber confesses and explains he wanted the best for his spoiled son who occasionally runs away from home.\n",
