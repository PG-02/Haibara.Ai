Later, an actress comes and causes trouble. The next day, she is found hanged in her room.\n\nIn Greek Mythology, Icarus, who received wings, forgot his father's warning that he shouldn't fly too high, and flew higher and higher. He believed he could fly to the sun. But Icarus' wings couldn't bear the heat when he got too close to the sun. After his wings burned, Icarus fell from the sky right to the ground.\nAfter investigating in the crime scene, Conan understands that Bizen's death wasn't a suicide, but a murder. He collects pieces of evidence, gets Kogoro asleep, and solves the case.\n",

To me, it looks as though your younger brother's soul tried to stop you and stopped to rest on your shoulder.  (弟さん喜んでいるでしょうか？チョウは亡き人の魂ともいいます。私にはまるで、弟さんの魂が罪を犯そうとしているあなたを止めようとあなたの肩で羽を休めたように思えるんですが……)\n"
