    "Situation": "The Detective Boys accompanied Ayumi to an apartment where she was promised by the owners, to replace her own broken ningyō (traditional Japanese doll), a complete set of 7-tier Hinamatsuri dolls if she could correctly position the dolls. Conan surprised Ai by his knowledge of how the individual dolls were to be arranged, what was supposed to be a girl's hobby. Conan revealed he had been made to help Ran organizing the dolls when he was younger. After the dolls were correctly assembled, a neighbor came by and brought along a professional art connoisseur to verify the genuineness of an Edo era Raijin antique painting scroll hung openly in the apartment. The neighbor wanted persuade the owners to let him buy it to complement the Fūjin picture he already acquired. However, as it was an heirloom, the owners refused to sell. The connoisseur was upset at the lack of care in how the antique artwork was treated. Both left shortly, after the neighbour reminded the owners they were having financial difficulties. The children went on an errand to buy wine for the owners to make amazake as a treat for them. When they came back, they ran into the connoisseur who claimed he left his mobile behind. Reaching the apartment, they discovered nobody answered the door which was unlocked, and upon entry, discovered the apartment in a mess and the valuable painting had disappeared.\n\nThe police was called into what appears to be a break-in that occurred while all occupants happened to be out. However, Conan pointed out the clues which narrowed down the suspects to the neighbor who had been trying to purchase the painting without success, the art connoisseur, the old lady who lived in the apartment with her son and daughter-in-law, the son being absent from the story as he was at work the whole time. Conan also noticed that though the positions of the dolls had been disturbed, it reflected the traditional precedence was given to the left over the right, a custom which was only changed during the Meiji era. The more obvious suspects would be the old lady who originally came from Kyoto in Kansai region where many older traditions were still observed and the connoisseur who would have specialist knowledge of the subject.\n",
    "People": "- 43 years old\n- Housewife\n- 78 years old\n- Setsuko's mother-in-law\n- 54 years old\n- Neighbor\n- 55 years old\n- Antiques appraiser\n- Tokyo MPD assistant inspector\n- Momose's assistant\n",
    "Resolution": "- Because the person who stole the scroll must knew its 20 million yen value, Conan deducts that the culprit must be among the four people who knew its price and had access to the crime scene, who also had no reason to steal any other valuable item from the household.\n- The reason the position of the prince and princess doll were swapped because the one who rearranged the doll used the original Kyoto arrangement, in which the left side is considered higher position than the right, thus the male prince doll was placed on the left side and the female princess doll was placed on the right. This is in on contrast to the modern arrangement which came in during Meiji Era, in which the right side is considered the higher position. Because of this, Conan remove Tsumagari who doesn't know about doll arrangement and Setsuko who was the one who checked Ayumi's doll arrangement position from the suspect list, leaving Yayoi who was born in Kyoto and uses her birthplace's doll arrangement method, and Mie who is also well-versed in its tradition.\n- The missing Scroll of Raijin is actually hidden under the clothes that the dolls were placed on, with the painting itself placed upside down to hide the larger wooden cylinder attached to the scroll, which Conan realizes from Ayumi's words that the \"laughing doll smiles less than usual\".\n- Since the scroll is hidden under the doll set, Conan concludes the culprit to be Yayoi Kanno, as she is the only person that can remove the scroll from its hiding place after the police have left.\nAs it turns out, Yayoi actually wants to protect the scroll from being taken away from the Kanno household, for that the thunder god himself is the guardian of their family. Many years ago, her late husband found a pair of painting of both Raijin and Fujin among the heirlooms, and told her that the two gods are the deities that protected their family since ancient time. However, when she heard that her son and Setsuko were unable to afford their current apartment shortly after their marriage, Yayoi decided to sell the Scroll of Fujin to support them financially, keeping it from her husband who was on a business trip at time. In a cruel twist of fate, the ship that her husband was on was swallowed by the wave, like the one in the scroll's painting. Believing that her husband's death was a punishment for her action, Yayoi resolved to protect the remaining Scroll of Raijin at all cost as she sees that each time the scroll is dirtied as it taking away the family's misfortune.\nHearing Yayoi's suffering, both Tsumagari and Mie decide to back down from pressuring the family to sell the scroll, with Mie offers to teach the family how to take care of their important heirloom. Though Yayoi decides to turn herself in for her perjury crime, Inspector Momose decides to write this case off as a simple \"household member losing their item and finding it\" case as he also doesn't want to prosecute her. Ayumi also decides not to take the Hina dolls, considering that maybe her Hina doll got injured to protect her from misfortune like the Scroll of Fujin and she will ask her father to have it repaired again, but asks Setsuko to take \"special\" a picture for the Detective Boys instead.\n",
