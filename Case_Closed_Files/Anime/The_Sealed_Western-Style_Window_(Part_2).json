    "Situation": "Sonoko, Ran, Eisuke, and Conan were hiking to Sonoko's Gunma Prefecture mountain villa when they discovered the bridge leading to the lodge had collapsed due to disrepair. Out of range of mobile phone signals, they went to a neighbouring villa to request the use of the house phone, and learned that it was recently bought over by a music group \"Dorcus\" as a den for composing new music.\nThe band members revealed that they got the villa dirt cheap as it was supposed to be haunted. The seller had originally built it together with his older brother.\nAfter moving in a while, the older brother declared an evil spirit had invaded the house. Despite nailing shut one of the casement windows on the second floor which he claimed was used by the malevolent presence, the older brother went into despair. One of the servants claimed to have seen the sealed window opened with a peering face behind it. Shortly afterwards, the older brother's wife was found dead, hung in a classical locked-room scenario. This was followed by the older brother's suicide. The younger brother decided to get rid of the property.\n\n\nWhile waiting for Sonoko's sister, Ayako, to pick them up, Ran and her friends walked around the villa. Eisuke suddenly announced he saw a peering face from the sealed window which mysteriously opened briefly. They rushed into the house and discovered one of the band members hung dead in the same room as the older brother's wife, and in the same locked room style.\n\nInspector Misao Yamamura arrived to investigate. Conan also tries to gather clues to help, but is limited to what he can do when a sneaky Eisuke starts to spy and watch him. Conan has to use different tactics so he won't seem suspicious to him.\n",

    "Trivia": "- The three musicians' vehicle is a medium cadet blue metallic 2005 Chevrolet Astro.\n- The Sonoko's villa which appears at the beginning is the one from Mountain Villa Bandaged Man Murder Case.\nRyoichi Takahashi who was present during that case is shown again in a background sequence.\n- Ryoichi Takahashi who was present during that case is shown again in a background sequence.\n- Though Conan opts to not knock out Misao Yamamura or Sonoko Suzuki like he had in previous cases, part of why he likely didn't just knock out Eisuke Hondou may be due to him wanting to avoid the situation he went through in The Holmes Freak Murder Case with Heiji Hattori where after knocking Hattori out, Hattori regained consciousness partway through Conan's deduction and discovered that he's Shinichi Kudo as a result.\n- Ryoichi Takahashi who was present during that case is shown again in a background sequence.\n",
