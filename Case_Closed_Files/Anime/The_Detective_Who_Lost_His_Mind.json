    "Situation": "Kogoro and Conan this time encountered a client named Kanoko Kon. Whereupon they visited her residence with a great extent of curiosity. After entering the house, Kogoro scrutinised the interior and noticed a row of trophies aligned side-by-side. Beside the rightmost trophy there was also a photo of Sakurada Sakura, who is an idol jockey that belonged to Kon Corporation, the company which Kanoko's husband owned. Instinctually, Kogoro fiddled with the heavy trophies but then stopped his behaviour after hearing Kanoko's voice kicking in upstairs. After some customary greetings, Kanoko praised the refinement of Kogoro's new suit; Kogoro boasted that he had just purchased it yesterday at the Beika Department Store.\nRight after, Kanoko explained to Kogoro her intent for hiring a private detective: she wanted to be certain of whether her husband, Heiwa Kon, is having some affairs with obviously that idol jockey Sakurada Sakura. While Kanoko was recounting the fames that her husband had claimed, Conan noticed that security cameras were installed in an ubiquitous fashion. Kanoko admitted and uttered that they exist to inspect her husband's every move in real-time.\nIn the following week, Kogoro and Conan liaised with each other to tail Heiwa throughly. After that, Kogoro agreed to meet Kanoko for one final time, in order to report all his finding throughout the week. It was a two o'clock, Kogoro awaited her with a seemingly triumph face, whilst having a band-aid stuck on his face. For some reason, they entered a Ferris wheel.\nUpon the Ferris wheel, Kogoro told everything to Kanoko: her husband did not cheat on her at all, and no suspicious activities done by Heiwa had been noted. After hearing Kogoro's words, Kanoko expressed her gratefulness towards Kogoro and invited him to dine in a restaurant, at five o'clock.\nAt the restaurant, Kogoro realised that Kanoko's hair had been shortened, later he learned that she went to a salon before dining with Kogoro. They called it a night with some cheerful meals. Exiting the restaurant, Kanoko rendered some degree of weariness, thus Kogoro decided to accompany her home. After successfully sending her home, Kogoro was about to leave, yet he heard a loud scream by Kanoko afterwards. He ceased his footsteps and dashed towards Kon's residence. The scene he saw was...\n\nConan tagged along, since Ran was worried about Kogoro. Glancing over Kogoro, he reminisced about Kogoro walking outside sneakily after during noon. After following him, Conan found himself standing next to a barbershop.\nGoing through the security footage installed in Kanoko's house, they found out that the culprit attacked the victim unexpectedly from the back of the sofa, evidently, the murder weapon was the rightmost trophy deposited on that table initially. Additionally, the time of the murder happened at 16:32. Then the police looked closely at the footage video, they realised that the suit that the culprit was wearing was exactly the one Kogoro was wearing. Just when everyone was about to draw their suspicion upon Kogoro, Kanoko spoke. She attested Kogoro's alibi, as during that time, they were all sitting inside the Ferris wheel cabin. Kogoro's grieve had been annihilated since then - yet not so long, Kanoko overthrown the validity of this alibi. They had the discussing at 2:00, meanwhile the crime took place at 16:32, they then had dinner at 5:00 afterwards. This means that a hiatus of three hours of alibi from two o'clock to five o'clock could not be verified. Kanoko herself claimed that she was in the salon getting a haircut at half past four; as a result, Kogoro still had sufficient time to carry out the murder.\nApparently, the police believed the accusation despite the lack of motive (since they found Kogoro's fingerprints on the murder weapon trophy), Inspector Megure had no other choice except to arrest Kogoro. In the nick of time, Shooooo~, Conan activated his Stun-Gun Wristwatch.\n",
    "People": "- 31 years old\n- Heiwa's wife\n- Kogoro's client\n- Victim (bludgeoned)\n- 40 years old\n- Kon Corporation chairman\n- Kanoko's Husband\n- Idol horse rider\n- Tokyo MPD CSI officer\n- Tokyo MPD CSI officer\n- Barber\n",
    "Resolution": "",
    "How Kogoro Got Framed": "Conan summarized the culprit's crime logic by dividing it into two aspects:\nAs such, the culprit plotted this plan of murder according to the above two premises.\nThen how did the culprit manage to know that? Everything would make 1000 times more sense if Kanoko Kon was the culprit - Kogoro was seen touching the trophy in Kanoko's house, she could see everything utilizing the cameras installed. She could also buy the same suit as Kogoro after learning the location disclosed by Kogoro in her house. In short, she bought the exact same suit as Kogoro, and carried out the murder under the security cameras.\n",
    "Breaking Her Alibi": "After hearing Conan's deduction, Kanoko went mad and refuted him angrily. She said that during the murder time, 4:31, she was in the salon, thus having an alibi. The perfect evidence would be her cut hair.\nIgnoring her insanity, Kogoro urged Takagi to review her security camera videos captured: obviously, the scenes recorded did not match with the time appended on it; it was 16:32, yet the shadows people had in that video was far shorter than that of the one it should be at 4:31 (which should be at around 13:00). Consequently, it can be surmised that Kanoko faked the time of that video.\nShe altered the time of the footage video by first changing the security camera's clock before committing crime. Then put the clock back after the crime had been committed.\n",
    "Kogoro's Alibi": "That way, Kanoko's alibi and been shattered severely. But simultaneously, Kogoro said that he had an alibi during the crime: he was at a barbershop an hour before meeting Kanoko in the restaurant!\nThe positive proof for this would definitely be the wound caused unintentionally by the barber when shaving Kogoro's beard. Takagi took off the band-aid on stuck on Kogoro's face, and the wound beneath it explained everything.\n",
    "Aftermath": "Seeing the truth being unraveled, Kanoko went berserk by snarling unscrupulously in front of the police. Megure then asked her about the motive, and she said that she never had loved her husband, but only his company Kon Corporation; she also thought that if she had taken over some responsibilities, the company would had grown much larger in size.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This marks the first time when there are more anime episodes (1126) than manga chapters (1125). However, the manga caught up four days later.\n"
