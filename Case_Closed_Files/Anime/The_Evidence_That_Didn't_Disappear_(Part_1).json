    "Situation": "Agasa takes the Detective Boys to a neighbor who is giving away his belongings before moving to England. While there Teruya Kanou's, the neighbor, Papillon is missing when the longcase clock strikes twelve and chimes twelve times. When Doyle's, the Papillon, collar is found inside an incinerator and the backdoor opens, Conan realizes that a culprit attempted to falsify the scene to give the impression Doyle ran away when in fact the culprit is hiding Doyle in the house to steal him afterward. Shino Hasuki's shoes are found near the crime scene and she is suspected of being the culprit.\n\n",

Shino Hasuki is named after the Husky, Aki Tosabayashi is the Tosa, Teruya Kanou is the Dobermann (because his name is a reference to Joji Kanou from Doberman Deka), and Yoshio Tsunashima is named after Tsunayoshi Tokugawa who had the nickname \"dog shogun\" because of his institution of animal protection laws, particularly for dogs.\n- This case stated that it had been ten days since the bus hijacking incident.\n- As a traitor who could died, Haibara compares herself to Marie Antoinette, the beautiful French princess who met her end at the guillotine.\n",
