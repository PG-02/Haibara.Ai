    "Resolution": "\nThe culprit behind the mysterious messages is Mei Tsukuba who was targeting Eri Kisaki for the past murder Hiroto Ashida had seemingly committed.\nIn truth, Hiroto Ashida had indeed committed the murder as Eri had figured out the truth about his motive and had been sworn to secrecy by him. However after some urging by Conan as Kogoro, Eri reveals the shocking motive which was Mei Tsukaba herself. Back when Hiroto was still in the university, his would be victim (a crooked professor) had stolen his report that he had painstakingly written to pass off as his own.\nWhen Hiroto had tried to argue against this, the crooked professor revealed the shocking truth about his little sister Mei’s enrollment into the university. As it turns out the crooked professor had accepted a bribe from their own mother to enroll her daughter Mei into the university. Unfortunately their mother would pass away soon after from an illness taking the truth to her grave. But as it turns out the only reason why their mother had bribed the professor in the first place was due to the crooked professor urging her to do so in the first place.\nHe further revealed that he had blackmailed their mother for hush money since it would be her word against his. The crooked professor then decided to blackmail Hiroto for more money to keep quiet about all of this, as a result he decided to kill him. After telling all this to his lawyer Eri Kisaki, he had her promise to swear not to tell his little sister as she would not only be devastated but also would’ve blamed herself for all the pain her family had gone through and most likely would have taken her own life.\nWhen Mei learns all this it shocks her to her very core, as she had misunderstood and had targeted Eri for no reason as she been protecting her all this time. It is then that Mei tries to kill herself, but luckily Kogoro regains consciousness and stops her, although she continues to struggle. Takagi then comes in saying that her brother wants to apologize to her and her brother will be getting a retrial and Mei hearing this drops the knife and surrenders peacefully.\n\n- Deceased (illness)\n- Mei's mother\n",
