    "Situation": "Conan gets a new book, then returns home to discover that Heiji and Kazuha have dropped by for a surprise visit. The gang then goes to a pasta restaurant where Heiji wants to go see a baseball game the next day, while Kazuha wants to see a Takarazuka theater show. Mouri decides that to figure out where to go, they will have a deduction contest on a case that Mouri just received. Kazuha then says that it's unfair, because Heiji is a great detective. Hence, Mouri says that he will support Kazuha in the case. Heiji notices that Kogoro wants to see showgirls at the theater. Ran also supports Kazuha, since they're good friends, leaving Conan on Heiji's side.\n\nHeiji decides to throw the match for Kazuha but he accidentally solves the case. Kazuha tells Ran she does not really mind, as she just wanted to see Heiji's excitement when he solves a case.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (beaten)\n- 53 years old\n- Tsujiya Toy Manufacturing president\n- Tsujiya Toy Manufacturing designer and accountant\n- Tsujiya's ex-wife\n- Tsujiya Toy Manufacturing salesman\n- Tsujiya Toy Manufacturing designer\n- Tsujiya Toy Manufacturing vice-president\n- Bookstore owner\n- Tokyo MPD forensics officer\n",
    "Resolution": "Hasami murdered president Tsuchiya while pinning the blame on Iwatomi also because he and Iwatomi tried to push selling unsafe toys which may harm the children that bought it, claiming that the company doesn't have enough income for the safety procedure, despite the fact that the president himself had embezzled huge amounts of the profit and hid them inside the safe under everyone's nose. Hasami didn’t want to lie to children to sell shoddy dangerous toys.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The book Conan bought is named Detective Samonji Series, File 44: \"The Last Will and Testament Prepared by the Devil\", and it's also considered the final chapter.\n- The suspects names are all themed after the game, rock paper scissors. Hasami Atsushi is scissors, as scissors in Japanese is hasami (although written with different kanji). The gami in Nakagami Isao is paper, and the iwa in Iwatomi Hajime is boulder, the kanji of which is made up of mountain and rock. When kids in Japan end in a tie in rock paper scissors they say aiko desho when they play again, which overlaps with Aiko Nao.\n",
