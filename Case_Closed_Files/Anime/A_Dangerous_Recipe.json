    "Situation": "One day, the Detective Boys are bored so they pick up receipts in a convenience store to guess what the people are buying for dinner. Genta picks up a weird receipt with food items, a dust bin, a container, a bike handle light, rechargeable batteries, thin latex gloves, and chlorine. Conan figures out the man is trying to make the same poisoned bait used to kill moles, but it's unlikely that he's having a mole problem in the middle of a city.\n",
    "People": "- Kobayashi Satoshi Ekimae drugstore cashier\n- Super Otomo supermarket food section cashier\n- Super Otomo supermarket general merchandise section cashier\n- Super Otomo supermarket general bicycle section cashier\n- Utopia Beika convenience store clerk\n- Utopia Beika convenience store manager\n",
    "Resolution": "After searching around town at the stores the man visited, the Detective Boys find out the approximation of the man's house and begin searching for bikes with handle lights and no basket.\nAfter finding the suspicious man and following him at night, they find out Yasuo Murakami was trying to poison a neighbor's dog.\n\n\n",
    "Trivia": "- Around 13 minutes into the episode when the camera pans over a bed with a jacket on it, there is a Shonen Sunday magazine next to the bed with an image of Kaitou Kid on it.\n- The Kamen Yaiba ball Genta holds has a mistake, since the hero's name is written as \"Yaiber\" instead of \"Yaiba\".\n- The day of the crime (March 6th, 2000) is the same as the original airdate. This is indicated by all receipts shown except the last one which indicates March 5th.\n"
