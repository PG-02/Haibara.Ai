    "Situation": "One night, two office workers named Arisa Nakashima and Susanne Trümpelmann are on their way home when they suddenly meet what appears to be an alien appearing at the lower end of a set of stairs leading down from an abandoned temple. The two women are frightened, but then the alien announces, \"We are extraterrestrials\", while tapping its throat, and asks them to take a picture of him and publicize it. Amused by this proposition, the two women cheerfully agree to this and pose for a picture and even a video clip with Nakashima's smartphone. Suddenly, they hear a man yelling in fear, \"It's an alien!\", and then the body of a man comes tumbling down the stairs from above. As it comes to rest at the bottom and the frightened women and their extraterrestrial friend gather around it, the \"alien\" reveals himself to be a costumed man.\n\nThe morning after that, the Detective Boys investigated the scene and begin to suspect the costumed man to be responsible for a prank gone wrong. However, they are met by a boy named Kota Matsumoto who claims that the incident was actually his fault: the culprit, Hitoshi Takedera, is an acquaintance of his, a kind office worker who plays with the children on his off-days at the children's center. Kota is a firm believer that aliens are mankind's friends. When a bully from his class claims otherwise, it apparently inspired Takedera to dress up as an alien and find witnesses to spread the benevolence \"fact\" in order to do his young friend a favor.\nAs the children contemplate Takedera's mishap, they witness Nakashima and Trümpelmann laying down flowers at the stair bottom and paying their respects to the deceased, Yasuo Hanzaki. When questioned about the accident, Nakashima produces her smartphone and shows them the video, which has by happenstance recorded the incident. The two women also confess that following Takedera's request of taking a picture of him, they had quickly realized that this must have been a prank and had played along just to humor him. The Detective Boys begin to reconstruct the details of the incident and realize that it may have actually been foul play since, considering the distance between the top and the bottom of the stairs, Hanzaki likely could not have recognized the costumed Takedera as an alien.\nDeciding to investigate, the Detective Boys decide to question Hanzaki's next-door neighbour, Tsuneyuki Tamai. Tsuneyuki is able to tell them that Hanzaki was unemployed after having been laid off from his factory job, and was blackmailing someone, which makes the Detective Boys suspect that the blackmailee is very likely Hanzaki's murderer as well. Since Hanzaki habitually left his apartment door unlocked, the Detective Boys enter to look for clues, but all they find is an ashtray full of cigarette stubs, a lot of karaoke giveaway dolls, and a note from an ear, nose and throat clinic. But after some thinking, Tsuneyuki remembers a phone conversation between Hanzaki and his blackmail victim which suggests that Hanzaki was attempting to force him to give him his old job back. However, Hanzaki used to work for a mere subcontractor for the prestigious firm Sank Heavy Industries, which was not satisfyingly profitable.\nNext, the Detective Boys meet Takedera, who has just left a police station after having been questioned. Takedera explains that he chose to adopt an alien disguise upon the suggestion of his old college friend, Akira Omi, who was a fellow member of his college's children literature club. The alien costume was part of a children's play he and Omi had concocted during their college days. But when he mentions that Omi requested him to be at a certain time and place to perform his act in front of witnesses, the Detective Boys instantly realize who the culprit is, but the possibility that Hanzaki would fall into a blind panic at the mere sight of an alien is factually next to nil. After Genta accidentally bumps his head on a lamp post with an advertisement sticker for an ear, nose and throat clinic, Conan at once realizes the decisive flaw the culprit has committed in the execution of his crime.\n",
    "People": "- 23 years old\n- Office worker\n- Susanne's friend\n- 22 years old\n- Office worker\n- Arisa's friend\n- German\n- Victim (fell)\n- 42 years old\n- Unemployed\n- 6 years old\n- Beika Elementary School first year\n- 26 years old\n- Office worker\n- 40 years old\n- Yasuo's neighbor\n- Unemployed\n- 26 years old\n- Office worker\n- Sanko Industries Production manager\n",
    "Resolution": "\nOmi was being blackmailed by Hanzaki after the latter once witnessed him shoplifting from a convenience store. At first Hanzaki demanded money, but since Omi worked at a renowned firm and thus earned a more sizeable salary than Hanzaki ever had, he demaned that Omi should get him a job at Sanko Industries. This, however, proved to be the final straw which drove Omi to murder him. By suggesting to Takedera that he should disguise himself as an alien to do Kota a favor, he set his kind colleague up as a scapegoat and used the plan to make his murder attempt look like an accident, with witnesses to report it.\nHowever, the decisive evidence for Omi's guilt is that, due to his heavy smoking and passion for karaoke, Hanzaki was suffering from an inflammation of his throat at the time of his death, rendering him unable to speak at normal volume, much less shout. In fact, Omi had knocked Hanzaki out the moment he arrived, then loaded Hanzaki on his back and waited for Takedera to make his appearance before shouting and then casting Hanzaki off his back and down the stairs. Nakashima's video recorded the shouting voice quite clearly, so with a proper analysis the fact that it was really Omi shouting can be easily established.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The character design for the alien is the same in Chiba's Difficult UFO Case.\n"
