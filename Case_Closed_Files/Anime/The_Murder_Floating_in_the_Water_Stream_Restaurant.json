    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan are waiting for their reservation at Riyu Stream Restaurant, a highly popular traditional Japanese restaurant of Blowfish Milt. While Kogoro is frustrated of waiting and being hungry, Conan looks around and sees computer controlled, miniature boats carrying food along a waterway. Anzai, the restaurant cashier, tells Conan that after the boats reach the guests' rooms, they push a button and the boat returns automatically. Kaneda and Arai, faculty of Joumon University, enter the restaurant to celebrate Kaneda's new employment as assistant professor of physics. Anzai knows that a person called Kaneda reserved room #8, which Kaneda denies after Arai asks him about it. Their professor, Iwama, comes out to meet them and remarks on how late they are. Arai wants Kaneda to apologize for delaying them since Iwama planned this event. Kaneda brushes this off rudely and Arai is offended, to which Kaneda tells Arai to address him formally: as assistant professor. They leave for the room Iwama made the reservation in, which is room #3, after Kaneda orders the most expensive thing on the menu: blowfish milt. Conan, Ran, and Kogoro go to room #2 when the time for their reservation comes and Conan notices Kaneda leaving room #3. During their meal, Kogoro enjoys his wine and Conan is pleased with the food, but the dinner is interrupted when they hear a woman scream. They rush to the scene to see Anzai terrified by Kaneda's body with a knife in his chest.\n\n",

When Iwama first appeared, the chefs said that Iwama bought lots of food regularly, even though he did not finish it all.\n- Method and Conclusion\nKogoro via Conan, described how the murderer entered room #8 using the big boat on the waterway. The big boat had enough space in it to hide someone with small body. First, the murderer asked that all the food to room #3 be delivered on the big boat. After removing the food, he took off the wooden boards and got in the boat. Using the sensor, the boat was en route to return to the place where the boats are parked. On the way there, the murderer used his foot to turn off the switch for the sensor. The boat's motor stopped and he arrived at room #8, where Kaneda was waiting because the murderer requested to meet in private. Kaneda must have been surprised but probably did not suspect this person would harm him because this person was a close friend. The murderer then stabbed Kaneda and positioned his body facing the corridor to appear as if the murderer had entered through the front door.\nThe murderer got back into his boat, flipped the switch to turn the sensor back on and the ship returned to the spot where all the ships were parked. The murderer was able to return to his room because the boat was scheduled to deliver whiskey to room #3 at 8:00. During this trip, with the murderer still inside the boat, the boat passed by Conan's open shoji screen. Conan noticed that the waterline was high, meaning the boat was deep in the water despite only carrying the whiskey set, which proves the murderer was inside the boat.\nMegure realized that to do all of this, the murderer would have to be in room #3 by himself and be a close friend to Kaneda. He figured Nobuo Iwama is the murderer which Conan agreed with. Conan believed Iwama made Kaneda meet with him in private and sent Arai to buy cigarettes, which Iwama knew was not a brand sold in the restaurant. Iwama reminded them he was looking for his contact lens at the time of the murder. Conan points out Iwama could be carrying a tape recorder but Iwama said it was for business.\nConan then explains how Iwama closed the shoji screen without being present in the room. Iwama used a rubber band, a pin, the wrapper of disposable chopsticks and ice. He tied the rubber band around one pin Iwama attached to the shoji screen left frame and to another pin on the left side of the shoji screen. Next, he wrapped the wrapper on the opposite side of the shoji screen and pinned it against the adjacent shoji screen frame using another pin. He opened the shoji screen up to the wrapper and pinned it in place.\nSo, the rubber band was stretched from the left frame to the left side of the shoji screen, while the right side of the shoji screen was pinned to the left side of the wrapper. The right side of the wrapper was pinned to the right side of the frame. This setup held the shoji screen open by the wrapper, with the rubber band trying but unable to snap back into a relaxed form and shut the door with it. Iwama put a piece of ice from the food in the middle of the wrapper, which, when melted caused the wrapper to soak up water and tear. Since the wrapper that was holding the door in place was split, the shoji screen had nothing to hold it in place and closed because the rubber band snapped back into its relaxed form.\nConan found no traces of this technique in the room, except for the wet corner of the shoji screen and a small hole. This means Iwama cleaned up the rubber bands and pins, disposed of the tape and tossed the wrapper in the waterway. However, Conan had conclusive evidence which was the sauce for the milt Kaneda ordered. When the boat carrying the food first arrived, Arai spilled some sauce on the boat accidentally. Conan recounts that when Anzai screamed, Iwama came out of his room and the first thing he did was stop to put his jacket on instead of rush to see the scene.\nSince he might have done this to cover up the milt stain, Iwama was probably in the boat and some sauce spilled on him from the boat's wooden panels. Iwama showed the police he had a stain on him but said he got it from knocking a plate over while looking for his contacts lens. Conan questions this, and brings to light that Kaneda had some sauce on his thumb, even though he left the room before the food got there. Conan finalizes his deduction by describing that Kaneda grabbed Iwama's arm as he was being murdered, and that Kaneda's fingerprint would still be on the stain on Iwama's shirt. After hearing this, Iwama confessed to killing Kaneda. He reflects that if Kaneda had not ordered the blowfish milt, which was not part of the original reservation, his plan would have been perfect.\n- Motive\n",
