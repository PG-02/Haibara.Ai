    "Situation": "Kogoro recieved a strange letter from a man named Keiji Asoh, asking him to investigate something on Tsukikage Island in the Izu coast, under Tokyo's jurisdiction. Kogoro, Ran, and Conan go to the island to only discover that Keiji Asoh had died twelve years ago.\n\nThey then meet Narumi Asai, who told them where to meet the mayor. At the community center, they discovered a room with a piano, where the former mayor was found dead two years ago.\n\nWhile the group are waiting outside, suddenly the first movement of Moonlight Sonata is played, and Hideo Kawashima was found dead in the piano room.\n\nConan then realized that the murder will happened again, and they decide to sleep at the piano room, along with the policeman and Narumi Asai.\nMegure arrived the next day and start intrograting the suspect. While intrograting Reiko, the second movement of Moonlight Sonata is played, and Tatsuji Kuriowa was found dead at the broadcasting room.\n\nConan realised that the music sheet left with the victims are codes. The old policeman then revealed that Keiji Asoh left some music sheets in his safe. While they are trying to unlock the community center storage room, Conan heard a sound coming from piano room. He then saw a suspicious person checking below the piano. Conan try to chase the person, but the person ran away. Conan tripped and found Shuichi Murasawa unconsious on the floor.\n\nNot long after that, Ken Nishimoto is found hanged in the storage room, along with music sheets.\n\nAfter looking at Keiji Asoh's last music sheets, Conan realized who is the culprit.\n",

    "Resolution": "In the second murder, they found that he had been dead for only a few minutes but when Conan fell on the code of blood, it didn't smear when it takes 15-30 minutes for human blood to dry. It was just a trick that the killer used to manipulate the time of death of the victim. Upon looking at the pictures, there was a button that was shining near Kuroiwa's neck.  But after the body was moved, the light was turned off. This was actually the reverse button. While the police weren't looking, the killer turned off the light. The killer used the reverse side (the blank side that didn't have the song), which played for over 30 min and then it reversed. That was when the 5 minutes and 30 seconds of gap played before the music started.\nIn the third murder, the killer didn't have the time to put a chair or desk at Nishimoto's feet because he had to escape in time.\nThe purpose of drowning Kawashima was to send the forensic examiner back to Tokyo, because it was impossible to do an autopsy on the island. The tape in the second murder was a setup so the killer could create an alibi.\nConan deduced that the killer was Narumi Asai and that she was, in fact, Asoh's aforementioned son, Seiji Asoh. Asai was probably the surname of the family that adopted him. After graduation, he came to the island as a female doctor. The pronunciation of his name was not written on his diploma, nor the medical license, because if they checked his history, they would have found out that he was a man: the kanji forming Asoh's name could be read as either \"Seiji\" (a male-only name) or \"Narumi\" (a female-only name): coupled with Asoh's feminine features and rather girlish voice, it let him masquerade as a female doctor rather well, plus falsifying the times of death and manipulating the crime scenes.\nSuddenly, Seiji dissapeared. It turns out that Seiji, who had realized that he had been found out, locked himself inside the community center piano room and set it on fire, intending to die like his father.\nConan, carrying Asoh's last music sheets with his message for the then-young Seiji, managed to slip in and told Seiji, who was sitting at the piano, to keep on living.\nSeiji's motive dated back when his father, the pianist Keiji Asoh, and his family was murdered. Kawashima, Nishimoto, Kuroiwa, and Kameyama used Asoh's international concerts as a front for their international drug trade. When Asoh stated that he wouldn't cooperate any longer, they got scared that their secret might be exposed, so they locked the family in their home and set it on fire. This was all written in the sheet music that he left behind in the safe as his confession to his remaining son. Seiji was hospitalized in Tokyo at the time of the murder.\nSeiji went back to the island, under his \"Narumi\" disguise, because he never believed the official \"Keiji Asoh killed his family and himself\" version and wanted to find out the truth. When he told Kameyama that he was Asoh's son, the late mayor was terrified and told him everything and then had a fatal heart attack. Seiji played the Moonlight Sonata that his father loved so much upon seeing the mayor dead, and ultimately that gave him the idea of taking justice in his own hands.\nWhen Seiji was done, Conan insisted that he should escape and live; Seiji refused, however, saying that he was now also like his father's murderers, covered in blood. Then, he grabbed Conan and threw him through the window, saving his life. Afterwards, he played one last music code message in the burning flames: \"Thank you, little detective\".\n\nAs for Murasawa, he was an admirer of the late Asoh and he was the one who kept the donated piano in tune just like that night.\n",
    "Adaptation changes": "",
    "Manga to reboot changes": "- Because the case consists of six manga chapters and being adapted into two episodes, there are some alterations to the case:\n- Some scene are removed:\n- Narumi's explanation about the mayor candidates.\n- Conan's early deduction that the culprit might be a man.\n- People's anger after the first case.\n- Narumi's discussion with Kogoro, Conan, and Ran while going back to the inn.\n- Kogoro running back to the crime scene after realizing that the murders aren't over yet.\n- Narumi, Kogoro, and the policeman's discussion about Kameyama's death.\n- A suspicious person peeking through the window, followed by Conan and Kogoro chasing that person.\n- Megure questioning people's alibis after the second murder.\n- Nishimoto's reaction towards Keiji Asoh's last music sheets.\n- Some of the suspects' backstory.\n- Megure retelling the events of the case.\n- Megure playing the third movement of the Moonlight Sonata recordings.\n- The moment where Conan tranquilizes Kogoro.\n- Some bits of dialogue are removed:\n- People's dialogues while Conan is running to the piano room.\n- Hirata mentioning that the piano plays itself.\n- People's dialogue about who Kogoro is.\n- The dialogues about who left the main room after Kawashima.\n- Megure's dialogue about guarding the building.\n- Kogoro's explanation about the remaining suspects to be interrogated.\n- Kogoro's question about who might attacked Murasawa and Reiko's answer.\n- The tension between characters and their emotions are less intense compared to the manga.\n- Ran notices that the music sheets are strange just by looking at them, and plays the sheets to prove it. In the manga, she recognized it while playing the sheet.\n- Megure is being shown hearing the second movement of Moonlight Sonata recording, while in the manga he just claims to have heard it.\n- Conan just recognized the drugs by simply looking at it. In the manga, he recognized it by licking it.\n- Some part of the deduction are being cut, especially the drugs deal backstory and the part about the culprit having to be a man.\n- Some part of Seiji's explanation to Conan are removed.\n- The scene where Hirata is being questioned by Megure after the end of the case is removed.\n",
    "Original version to reboot changes": "- Four metropolitan police detectives are added in.\n- The eyes of the victims are all closed instead of open, probably to make it less scary for the viewers.\n- In the first anime version, the election car's announcement is made by a woman, voiced by Yukiko Iwai, while in the reboot, the actor is changed for a man.\n",
    "Trivia": "- During the end credits of episode 1001, there is a title card reads, \"Special Thanks To everyone who loves Conan For the Next Mystery\".\n- Pianist Aimi Kobayashi plays the Moonlight Sonata in the episode.\n- These episodes are the last episodes to be produced under the name TMS/V1 Studio.\n"
