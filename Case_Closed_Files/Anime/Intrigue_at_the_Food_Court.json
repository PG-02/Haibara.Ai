    "Case": "Agasa told the Detective Boys that Conan suddenly has to go to Hokkaido, so they decide go to the Beika Central Park, where there is a coupled food event, the Beika City Farmer's Market, and a police event, where Megure, in a police uniform instead of plain clothes, is to give a speech, are taking place, since Genta is especially interested in an offer which promises free food for gradeschoolers and younger. However, they become unwitting earwitnesses to a conversation which bears a rather sinister tone.\n",
    "Situation": "\nIn order to catch them in flagranti, the Detective Boys split up, each of them following one suspect: Genta follows Yamawaki, Ayumi goes after Kanno, and Mitsuhiko shadows Kadokura. However, despite all precautions, Ayumi and Mitsuhiko are noticed and approached by their suspects. Thus confronted, they tell the kids that there isn't any bomb, that they're working at a local restaurant, and that they were just trying to gather the necessary material for the dish they'll prepare for the Market as an advertisement: Singapore's national dish, Chicken Rice. They serve it to the Detective Boys as an exception to dispel all suspicions. As the Detective Boys leave, they run into Sato and Takagi, whom they tell about these friendly people.\n",
    "People": "- 33 years old\n- Singaporean Marina restaurant food truck worker\n- 29 years old\n- Singaporean Marina restaurant food truck worker\n- 32 years old\n- Singaporean Marina restaurant food truck worker\n- Shimomura Cigarettes shop owner\n- Beika Bakery's neighbor\n",
    "Resolution": "However, just before they can execute their plan, Kadokura and his accomplices are arrested by Megure and the police on site. In fact, their plan didn't work since there was one detail the Detective Boys told Sato and Takagi about. The star on the van's logo wasn't related to stargazing, as they had told the children, but to the country the restaurant originates from: Singapore, which is called Star Country, something that every worker of the restaurant should know.\n\n\n\n",
    "Aftermath": "",
    "Trivia": "- The Singaporean Marina restaurant where the suspects work at is named after the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, which will be featured as one of the key locations in movie 23.\n- The Beika Bakery from The Shadow Approaching Amuro reappears in this episode.\n- Several vans and Food trucks featured in the event, which are Volkswagen Bus [Typ 2 / T2] and 1983 Toyota HiAce [H50], bear the national flag colors of Germany and Singapore. The suspect van is a 1999 Toyota Quick Delivery 200 [U280], like others. The license plate number of one is 新宿 800, さ 16•95 (Shinjuku 800, Sa 16•95).\n"
