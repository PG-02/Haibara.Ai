    "Situation": "Kogoro and Conan are walking around, when they see some police cars in front of a apartment. They decide to help the investigation.\n\nConan, Kogoro, Takagi, and Chiba later go to Takashi Hara's apartment, who is Lisa's boyfriend. Hara says that Satoshi Komaki, the owner of the bar where Lisa worked, might be responsible for the murder, because Lisa always complained about Satoshi hitting on her.\nLater, they go to see Satoshi, who revealed that he has a private relationship with Lisa. However, he refuse to tell his alibi, instead he ask the police if they should investigate the murder weapon, fingerprints on wine bottle, or the jacket the culprit wearing. Satoshi then says that Hara might be the culprit, because Hara always making eyes at his employees. He later tell the police that he was at home when the crime happened, and ask them to ask his wife Mihoko to proof the alibi.\nThe police then go to Komaki's apartment, and ask Mihoko about Satoshi's alibi. Later, Conan notices that there is a mic on the figurines on the table. Kogoro then ask how Mihoko married to Satoshi. Two years ago, he was engaged to Ryohei Oi. However, Ryohei was stabbed by unknown assailant. A suspect was arrested for the murder, but they died in prison, and it seems like it was a wrongful arrest.\n\nTurns out after that incident, the company she worked at suddenly went bankrupt, her sister was being stalked, her father's factory caught fire, and her mother fell off a train platform. After the series of unfortunate events, she meet Satoshi and got married.\nConan realizes that Mihoko is lying. He then search for the incident that happened on December 7, before telling Takagi and Chiba through messages that the room is bugged, and because of that, Mihoko can't tell the truth. Takagi decides to use eye blinking as a signal for \"yes\" or \"no\" for Mihoko. After they get the real answer thorough blinking, Takagi whispers to Mihoko that the police will ensure her safety.\nLater, Mihoko says that she should cook for her husband. When Kogoro see some vegetables, he deduces that she want to cook pork soup, or rather signaling morse code through chopping the vegetables. They then observe if there is a hint she try to make.\nSuddenly, Satoshi comes in  with his bodyguard, and force the police to leave the apartment. Before leaving, Conan gives a good luck charm to Mihoko.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (stabbed)\n- 25 years old\n- Floor staff\n- 47 years old\n- Bar owner\n- 28 years old\n- Satoshi's wife\n- 23 years old\n- Office worker\n- Lisa's boyfriend\n- Deceased (stabbed)\n- Artist\n- Mihoko's fiancé\n- Satoshi's bodyguard\n- Satoshi's bodyguard\n",
    "Resolution": "However, the evidence was later missing. Satoshi suspects that after he left Lisa's apartment, Mihoko snuck back inside and took the evidence with her. It is also revealed that beside the microphone, Satoshi has installed a camera in the stuffed bear on the sofa, which means he knows that Mihoko tried to tell the truth to the police. Conan through Kogoro then tells Takagi and Chiba that when Satoshi learned about Mihoko's betrayal, Mihoko and her family would be harmed.\nIt is true that Mihoko is trying to say something through the vegetables. Green onions, burdock, and daikon radishes are long and thin, but in order to to make clearer, she started choping them. The result is a shape of ballpoint pen. At the crime scene, a cleaning receipt is found inside the ballpoint pen. Later, the police obtains a shirt with bloodstain, which could be a concrete evidence to arrest Satoshi. Suddenly, Chiba receives a call that Satoshi is missing.\nSatoshi plans to kill Mihoko because of her betrayal. Satoshi also confesses that he killed Lisa because Lisa rejected Satoshi's offer and prefer to be with Hara.\n\n"
