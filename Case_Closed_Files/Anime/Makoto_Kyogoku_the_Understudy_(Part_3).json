    "Situation": "Conan, Ran, Sonoko, Masumi, and Makoto are walking on the street after watching a movie, when they find a man taking a woman hostage. Fortunately, Makoto knocks down the criminal to later see Shigematsu Tomioka telling that all of the scene was a drama shooting. Since the actor was unconscious, Makoto is chosen as the understudy. They later meet an actor, an actress, a production assistant and a makeup artist. The actor, Saiya Tokuzono is so annoying because he made a joke by making the actress, Nanako Jinmei to sign an autograph using an electric pen. When Makoto and Tokuzono go to an abandoned building, the staff prepares to film some scenes. When the director asks for Tokuzono, the actor suddenly screams and falls, and Makoto is the main suspect because he was in the same floor when the murder took place.\n\nThe police investigate the scene and also include the staff as suspects. Later, the assistant director finds something in the room of the murder. After looking at the camera recordings, the assistant director, Daisaku Odori somehow managed to figure out the identity of the murderer and starts to blackmail the culprit.\nConan discovers some clues but he has not discover the culprit yet. Sera starts asking Ran about Shinichi's sickness and where Conan was when Shinichi was around.\nConan later learns about the deceased production assistant called Nishibe, who was also Hideka's boyfriend. When all of the staff were drinking some drinks that were bought by Yota and Takagi, the assistant director suddenly falls poisoned onto the ground.\n\nLater, Sera almost discovers Conan's true identity after he responds normally when she called him Shinichi Kudo.\nConan tries to convince Sera that he is not Shinichi, but Sera does not believe him. She then asks Ran and Sonoko if there is any child that looked more mature around Conan, and they both mention Haibara.\nWhile playing games with the Detective Boys at Agasa Residence, Haibara tells Agasa that thirty years ago, her father worked as a member of Shirohato Pharmaceuticals R&D team. However, the company went bankrupt twenty-five years ago and her parents decided to open a small clinic. Meanwhile, after some investigation, Conan solves the case using Sonoko's voice.\n",

    "Resolution": "She then poisoned Odori by removing a straw tip, coating it with poison, and put it on another straw like a cap. After Odori collapsed, she was the first one to approach him, she discreetly removed the cap, and stored it inside her medicine capsule.\nHer motives were:\n- When Nishibe was pranked by Tokuzono, he remembered how he caused Nanako to have an accident, which caused him to a hard time sleeping barely getting a wink of sleep that night. Because of that, he died while driving to the film location the next day. She is was also angered by Tokuzono's words that actors could not be replaced, unlike production assistants.\n- Odori discovered that she was the murderer who killed Tokuzono because in the footage that was taken before and after Tokuzono fell to his death, she was the only one who kept looking up to the window despite the fact that a man had just fallen in front of her, so he started to blackmail her. Which also explains why he laughed after seeing the footage of the murder in progress.\nAfter she was discovered, she tried to commit suicide by driving the staff van into the building, but is saved by the combined efforts of Makoto and Ran.\n\n",
