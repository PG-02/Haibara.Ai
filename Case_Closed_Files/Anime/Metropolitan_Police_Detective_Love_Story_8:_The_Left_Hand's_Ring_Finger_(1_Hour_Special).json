    "Situation": "Sato is the talk of the police department after she is spotted wearing a new ring on her left-hand's ring finger. The other officers jealously corner Takagi thinking he got engaged to Sato and had been hiding it. Much to everyone's shock, Takagi did not give Sato the ring, which leads to even more speculation. Takagi is depressed and want to know who captured Sato's heart, but he isn't able to successfully ask her.\nMeanwhile, Kogoro is invited to attend an interview of the mystery book writer Masataka Moroguchi. Masataka Moroguchi recently acquired a gaudy diamond ring embedded with dozens and dozens of small diamonds. The next day, Moroguchi is found dead from consumption of poison and his ring is gone.\n\nThe room was locked and the key was in Masataka's upward facing, open palm. The only opening to the room is a small window that a child would have trouble squeezing through. The body was on the opposite side of the room, quite a distance from the window. Sato and Takagi are called to the scene. Despite these circumstances, the two officers and Conan believe Masataka was murdered by one of his three interviewers.\n",

    "Trivia": "- Detective Conan chief producer, Michihiko Suwa, voiced one of the police detectives in this episode.\n- This case featured an unique closing animation based on the case's police and ring theme. The unique opening animation was also based solely on this case. No other person was shown in this opening other than Sato, Takagi, Megure, and Shiratori, except for other Police officers behind Shiratori.\n- This case came out in both the manga and the anime, and it was brought up about cassette tape recorders being outdated, and most people are using digital recorders at this time.\n- When Conan remembered Sato fiddling with 'Sleeping Kogoro's' mouth, he was referring to The Shinkansen Transport Case, which is why he was hesitant to put Kogoro to sleep in this case, however in the The Photo Mail from the Clown he did put Kogoro to sleep in front of her without hesitation, however that case was a filler.\n- Many paintings in Moroguchi household are from Oikawa's house in Kaitou Kid and the Four Masterpieces, and two of them are from the recycle shop in The Victim Who Came Back, from Kogoro Gets Drunk in Satsuma, and from Akagi Inn in Sonoko's Red Handkerchief. Open spoiler box to see images.\n- Episode 303\n- Episode 388\n- Episode 458\n- Episode 469-470\n- Episode 487\n"
