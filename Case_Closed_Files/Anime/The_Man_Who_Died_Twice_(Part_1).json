    "Situation": "Kogoro and Conan are visiting Yoichi to investigate the threat. After his secretary Shinkai killed his president to stop him from deceiving people with his moneylending.\n\nAfter discovering the corpse, his younger brother Koji Takarada and the victim's wife, Mika Takarada, are both crying due to that incident. However, when Megure asked them a few questions, they are shocked, Mika being incredulous to learn that she's suspected. Mika had motives to kill her husband just to get the inheritance. Koji wants to get his inheritance, too. The building's manager, Kinsaku Tomii, witnessed a person holding a bag, wearing a pair of sun-glasses and a hat. They ask Shinkai who he/she is. But, he can't identify the person.\nThey continue questioning those two in Mika's house. Their housekeeper Kyoko Kinoshita confirms Mika's alibi. Shinkai truly said that he can confirm those two alibis. Koji said that he was in Shinjuku, and Mika was in the storehouse between 1 pm and the time her late husband was killed.\nLater, they found a beggar, who was wearing the wig and shade from the culprit. Mika's hair was found in it and although she is guilty, she's mad at Shinkai for making up such a big lie. Koji's prints were found on the threatening letter. Who is the culprit, is it Haruyuki Shinkai, Mika Takarada or Koji Takarada? Who's the culprit on this in case?\n",

The woman said that if he found something unusual, he wears it.\n- Third, he lies all about the alibis, he's the one who send the message to Mika that go into the storeroom to not verify her alibi.\n- Fourth, he was caught by the woman next condo, committing the crime.\n- Shinkai was right about Koji going to Shinjuku, but he didn't know he was chased by Yaginuma and there are many people, so it is hard to see the hero show. Half of it was the truth.\n- Fifth, he called the detective so that he can witness the crime, he was killed between 1 to 2 p.m\n- Also, the woman was found in the video was just a disguise.\n",
