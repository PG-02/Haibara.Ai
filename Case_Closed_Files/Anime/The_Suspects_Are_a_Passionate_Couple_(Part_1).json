    "Situation": "Kogoro and Ai are shocked and enraged at the news of Ryusuke Higo and Yoko Okino apparently dating each other. Therefore, Ai \"hires\" Kogoro to conduct an investigation about their relationship. While searching on the internet, they find out that the couple were spotted at a restaurant in Haido City. Conan then mentions that there's a new restaurant in Haido City which belongs to a senior of Higo, which results in Ai and Kogoro forcing Conan to take them there to spy on the couple. Haibara even goes as far as deleting the song Dandy Lion from her phone, even though it's her favorite song.\nTeiya Asuka, Higo's senior and the owner of the restaurant, has gone missing. The three employees, namely Yasuto Konoe (a waiter), Reiko Banba (a waitress and Asuka's girlfriend) and Akimichi Yamada (the restaurant's sommelier), have to go look for him. Konoe later receives a message from the owner, saying that he is in the storeroom and want to meet Higo and Yoko there. But when the couple arrives at the storeroom, they find Asuka dead, with his neck artery slit.\n\nInspector Megure suspects Yoko and Higo because they are first who found the body, and he states that the possibility is high that they are the murderers.\nConan deduces that the culprit is one of the three employees of the restaurant.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (throat slit)\n- 31 years old\n- Former football player\n- Restaurant Owner\n- Ryusuke's acquaintance\n- 43 years old\n- Sommelier\n- 27 years old\n- Waitress\n- Konoe's ex-girlfriend\n- Asuka's girlfriend\n- 28 years old\n- Waiter\n- Banba's ex-boyfriend\n",
    "Resolution": "Yamada killed Asuka during the second search when he went down to the storage room, then used Higo's and Asuka's phones to send a message to lure Asuka to a secluded spot for the murder. Using a vacuum cleaner, a vacuum compression bag, Asuka's clothes, and the corkscrew from his sommelier's knife, Yamada then pretended that Asuka was apparently still alive at the time of the murder and during his employees' search for him (thus establishing his alibi): By first sucking out all the air from the vacuum bag, then puncturing the bag with the corkscrew from his knife, caused the air to rush in and inflate the bag, creating an instant dummy beneath the blankets. To provide the evidence for that trick, Ai secures Higo's discarded phone and the vacuum bags from the kitchen's waste bin, which are riddled with Yamada's fingerprints.\nOther hints to Yamada's faked profession as a sommelier were provided when:\n- Yamada did not sniff the cork of the wine bottle he had served Higo and Yoko, something a real sommelier always does in order to find out whether the wine has been spoiled by the residue of the chemicals used in making the bottle corks,\n- and the fact that the cigarettes found in the toilet were of the same brand, but smoked in two different ways, proving that they were consumed by two different people. Yamada thus attempted to conceal his habit of smoking (a taboo for a sommelier, since his profession heavily depends on an unspoiled sense of taste) by mixing his own cigarette stubs with the ones used by Konoe.\nAs it turns out in the aftermath, Higo and Yoko are not dating each other; the watch they were looking at on the cover of the tabloid article was a mutual gift for a retiring high school teacher of theirs, and they were meeting with Asuka (a fellow graduate from their high school) to ask him to write a personal dedication on the watch.\n",
