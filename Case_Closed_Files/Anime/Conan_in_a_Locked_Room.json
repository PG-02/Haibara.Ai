    "Situation": "After the Bell Tree Express incident, Sonoko invites Ran, Kogoro, and Conan to a campsite where she is learning tennis, because she got a text from Makoto holding a tennis racket. Conan, glad to be leaving the Mouri Detective Agency after learning Amuro is Bourbon, finds out he is Sonoko's tennis teacher. Amuro tries to warn Conan that a racket is about to hit him, but it hits his head and knocks him unconscious. Amuro applies immediate first aid, and Conan recuperates at the cabin of Machi Umejima and her friend Kotone Momozono, the girl whose racket went flying and hit Conan. As Machi and Kotone treats Conan's party, there is an obvious animosity between Noboru Takanashi and Saburou Ishiguri, two other friends and classmates. It stems from the untimely death of their friend Uriu. When Conan wakes up, he finds the room overwhelmingly hot and Saburou dead from blunt force trauma to the head.\n\n",
    "People": "- 21 years old\n- College student\n- 22 years old\n- College student\n- Victim (bludgeoned)\n- 21 years old\n- College student\n- 22 years old\n- College student\n- Deceased\n- College student\n",
    "Resolution": "As Conan was about to tranquilize Kogoro, Amuro looked through his lens and asked what was he doing. Conan, not wanting Bourbon to realize who he really is, instead manipulated everyone's attention to the culprit: Kotone Momozono. Kotone hid a spare key to the room, which was used in the locked room murder in a bottle of a frozen sports drink, had it thaw a bit, then used it to commit the murder. She used the still melting Dry ice of the ice cream cake with the tennis racket to move his body in front of the door.\nAlthough, the episode did not state this she also probably turned off the AC in the room, since it apparently was on when Conan went to sleep in there and was off, when he woke up several hours later, by the sound of the falling vase. Also turning off the AC would cause the dry ice and the ice in the vase to melt even quicker, than it would have if the AC was still on.\nShe did it because Uriu, who was an easily emotional guy, would've been afraid to go jump in the snow from the balcony. But Saburou made a joke that the snow would cushion his fall which Uriu took seriously, and he ended up dying as a result. At first, Kotone thought Saburou's frantic digging in the snow was from disbelief that a friend had died. But he was retrieving the scarf that he himself worn, as it was evidence that he forced Uriu to jump off the balcony because at his last moment he grabbed Saburou’s scarf and didn't simply jump.\n",
