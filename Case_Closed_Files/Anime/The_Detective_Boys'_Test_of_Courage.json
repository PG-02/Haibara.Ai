    "Situation": "The Detective Boys are watching the famous horror videomaker \"Sadao and Toshiko\" duo at Agasa's house. After hearing that they can make money if the video go viral, they decide to make their own video. They decide to go to an abandoned hospital, where the rumors said that there are crying red baby demon, mummy in a wheelchair, and crazy long-haired lady doctor holding a scalpel. There is also a mysterious locked room on the third floor, which is room 304.\n\nOn the first floor, they find a black cat. Conan notices that the cat is pretty friendly for a stray cat. On the second floor, they find a mummy in the wheelchair, but the mummy is just a doll. Conan notices that the doll is new, and there are some newspapers from the same day six months ago lying around the room. One of the newspaper reported about a murder-robbery.\n\nThey finally arrive at the third floor, slowly approaching room 304. The door to room 304 is full of red-colored handprint. When Haibara plans to approach the door, the black cat suddenly passes through her feet. The cat is seen approaching someone, which reveals to be a long-haired lady doctor holding a scalpel. The Detective Boys then run away from the building. Later, Conan checks the video recorded by Mitsuhiko and finds something.\n",

The other suggest that it is a real ghost. Sadao then manages to get the camera and claims the video to be theirs. Suddenly, a man appears and scolds them for entering the building. When the black cat approaches the man and the same wound is revealed, it turns out that the mysterious person with long hair on the third floor is one of the suspects in the murder-robbery from six months ago, Junji Maruo. After being found out, he tries to kill the Detective Boys and Sadao and Toshiko, but is subdued by the group.
