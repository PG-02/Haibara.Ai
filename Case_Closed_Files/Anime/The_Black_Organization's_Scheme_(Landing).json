    "Situation": "A person (probably an FBI agent) is waiting for Tony, only to be welcomed by Vodka and Gin, with the latter giving him the choice of surrendering the FBI base location or the choice of being killed. A cold shot is made.\n\nConan, Haibara and the Detective Boys are discussing the recent unidentified foreign murders when they hear a loud noise. After seeing Vodka, Conan tells the Detective Boys and Haibara not to approach the scene, especially not to show themselves to Haibara, which frightens her immediately.\nConan tries to hide his appearance while trying to check the victim’s belongings that fell with Korn, Chianti and Gin getting ready to eliminate him but fortunately, there are also some other witnesses making the elimination very risky. Therefore, the Black Organization has to retreat. Conan finds the identity and a strange board that might be the code, so he tells others to hide in a convenience store while waiting for Agasa to pick them up, and Conan rushes to the Kudo’s residence. However, on the way, he can’t call either Akai or his parents. When he gets in the residence, he is surprised to see many FBI agents there.\nTurns out 3 days ago, an FBI agent named Aaron went missing when following the trace of Black Organization and was found dead on the next day, and several FBI agents were ambushed about 1 and 2 days ago, all of them used a specific code to form a meeting. With the concern that Aaron had leaked the way to solve the code for the Black Organization and most importantly, their base in Japan, all agents end up in the Kudo’s residence as a temporary hideout, with Kudo’s family buying supplies for them to avoid being exposed.\nConan then reveals the death of two recent FBI agents to James and explains the way he and most probably, the Black Organization, solved the code so easily. And to make it more intuitive, he asks Camel to print out two copies, with one of them reversed. Conan cracks the code easily, even reproducing the alphabet based on the code language, which impressed many FBI agents. Camel, however, suggests that they should use this loophole to lure the Black Organization out, combined with the fact that the press has not reported on the recent deaths of two FBI agents makes this plan seem almost flawless.\nMark also wants to join this plan to avenge his brother’s death, so Camel also volunteers to be along, with Akai reminding him that he must not show up his face to the Organization or else Kir might be killed as well, cutting the precious information. However, before the organization's hunt, Rum steps in and proves why he is second-in-command in the organization when he easily foils the FBI's counter-hunt plot and causes them to suffer heavy losses. Meanwhile, the Kudo couple suddenly returned and after they grasp the situation and Conan finally remembers something, the discovery of the counter-hunt plan was somewhat explained.\n\nThe Kudo family and Conan explain the mistake Jodie made while working on the code, the other agents console them that they had made a mistake. Fortunately, Camel's situation was fine, it was just that his friend Mark needed medical attention, so Akai gives instructions that Camel almost understands and follows immediately. This helps them temporarily get rid of the car chasing him, but he is later pursued by Gin, Vodka, Vermouth and Kir, and he eventually falls down the river.\nAlthough they have witnessed Camel's fall, it seems that Korn had seen him somewhere before, which gives the Black Organization a new target: to track down Camel's whereabouts. This made Kir extremely worried because if Camel is revealed as the agent who had previously escorted her, she would lose her life.\nMeanwhile, Camel was struggling in his car but luckily Conan's quick thinking helped him escape for the time being. Camel later finds land and based on certain characteristics, Yusaku and Conan deduce that Camel is currently on Umizaru Island, from which a rescue plan is made while Camel waits there to warm himself up to avoid hypothermia.\nAkai (disguised as Subaru) borrows Conan (who is very eager for this mission), but the unfavorable variable comes from the heating when it attracts Gin's attention, and also drags the members along to hunt him down, all because Korn had seen his face somewhere. Kir also calls Akai at this time to inform him that if she is the one to see Camel first, she will have to aim in the face, with Akai agreeing.\nCamel, who had previously smeared olive oil and dirt on his face, retrieved some sacks, a roll of tape, a box cutter, and some straws as instructed by Akai. Conan asks about his current belongings and realizes that the hat Camel was wearing is of some kind. However, the conversation is cut short when Vodka and Chianti accidentally enter Camel's hiding place, and Camel also overheard Vodka blowing Rum's cover.\nSuddenly Vodka accidentally sees Camel but he steps on coffee beans from a sack that Camel had picked up earlier, Chianti is no different as she apparently doesn’t have a pistol to shoot him. These two things allow Camel to temporarily use the diaphane technique as instructed by Akai to wait until morning because searching the entire island to find the diaphane would take a lot of time. When this plan is discovered by Gin, Gin intends to search the island, but Rum wants to turn the island into an incinerator.\nMeanwhile, Akai and Conan arrive at Namikaze Park, which is near the island where Camel and the organization are, but they see that the island is on fire, forcing Camel to wake up immediately, luckily he still has some of his belongings from before. However, the call is soon cut off when Chianti sees him, but she actually doesn’t have a real pistol as she shot Camel with a sniper rifle. Camel is now in a critical situation on the docks, with only a small barrier separating life and death. Will he make it back alive?\n",

    "Resolution": "After Camel falls into the sea, Gin plans to use a grenade and throw it to the sea to make sure Camel is death, but Akai successfully shot the grenade before it falls into the sea. The grenade then explode mid-air. Akai then make several random shots to scare away the Black Organization member. Eventually, they decide to leave the island when a fire boat appears to extinguish the fire that is burning the island.\nOn the boat, Vermouth tell the others that the man they shot earlier is Camel, showing his photograph. Gin then take Vermouth's phone and show the photo to Korn. It is revealed that Korn saw Camel two years ago, when Rum sent him two photos of Camel and Akai, who was a Black Organization member under the codename \"Rye\". Rum, who is in a black car, heard that and feel nostalgic, before warned the others that the boss is not happy that they attracted too much attention, but applauded them for killing Camel.\nBack to Kudo Residence, it is decided that Camel should get a haircut. Conan, Akai, and Yusaku then explain how they save Camel and why Akai didn't shot the Black Organization members. Akai then revealed that Conan is the one who actually come up with the plan, which made Jodie impressed. Conan then heard Akai and Yusaku talked about tea party. Later, Camel revealed what Vodka had said about Rum. Apparently, aside from Rum's false eye, the other rumors of his appearance are lies Rum himself spread. Nowadays, Rum wears a disguise and goes by a ridiculous name.\n",
