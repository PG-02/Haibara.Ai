The girl in question, named Ryoko Akagi, ask Kogoro to find a missing person.\n\nConan knew that something was up because he didn't really know Ryoko. So after Professor Agasa called him about his new gadget. He pretend that it was Shinichi who called and say he will contact Ryoko later. Ran insists on going to Ryoko's home so she might catch Shinichi, forcing Conan to go alongside her as well.\nWhen they're at Ryoko's apartment. Conan find several clues that lead him to believe Ryoko doesn't live here, and there's a kidnapping involved. Which is why Ryoko pretend to be Shinichi's girlfriend to get contact with him quickly. He decided to called Ryoko as Shinichi using Voice-Changing Bowtie and the Portable Bento Box Fax that Agasa gave him earlier to ask about the case. While trying to not get his real identity exposed to Ran. As she was furious about him 'supposedly' have a girlfriend without her knowing.\n\n",

    "Resolution": "- The letter written by Mamoru was worded very strangely. And there is a spot beside the text.\n- Conan found a video game called Onimaru Quest inside the ransacked room. In the game there are four characters named Mamoru, Hideo, Ryoko, and Naoki\nAccording to the Detective Boys, there is a point in Onimaru Quest where the main character dies and have to be resurrected to continue.\n- According to the Detective Boys, there is a point in Onimaru Quest where the main character dies and have to be resurrected to continue.\n- According to the Detective Boys, there is a point in Onimaru Quest where the main character dies and have to be resurrected to continue.\nConan deduced that 'Naoki' in the game likely named after Naoki Uemura, a soccer player who joined the Tokyo Spirits a year ago and a good friend of Hideo. Also known to like video games.\nHe then deduced that Mamoru was not kidnapped, but instead was with Naoki Uemura, which was made to look like it was a kidnapping. The letter that Mamoru left must have been a part of the whole letter saying that he was going to Naoki's apartment to have his main character resurrected.\nConan, Ran and Ryoko rushed to Naoki's place, and they found Mamoru there unharmed. After everything was cleared up, Ran tried to find Shinichi since she believe he's nearby, Conan end up having to pull a trick with Agasa's help to disguised himself as Shinichi for a moment.\nNaoki envied Hideo because even though their skills were pretty much the same, Hideo was still more popular than he was. He came close to surpassing Hideo, but during one of their practices, Hideo accidentally injured his leg. Naoki thought that it was done on purpose so he wouldn't be able to play.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga, the Detective Boys' conversation about the soccer match occurs while they are walking home from school, while the anime has them discussing it while sitting down on a park bench. Additionally, the scene in the manga ends on Conan reflecting how he'd be playing soccer on his high school fields if not for the men in black poisoning him, with a brief background appearance by Gin and Vodka.\n- In the manga, Ran later found out about the ransacked room and had Conan clean up the room. This did not happen in the anime.\n- In the manga, the story ends with a narrative exposition of Conan mentioning that it took three days before Ran accepted Ryoko's explanation of Shinichi's presence. The anime ended with the narration following the discussion in question back at the Detective Agency.\n",
