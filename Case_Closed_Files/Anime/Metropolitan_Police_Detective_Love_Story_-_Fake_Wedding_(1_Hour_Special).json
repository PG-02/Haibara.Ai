    "Situation": "Takagi and Miyamoto pose as a bride and groom in order to catch a serial killer/burglar who had threatened to kill the real bride and groom. When Chiba reports that the burned corpse of one of the weddings guests is found near the river, Megure deduces that the victim was killed by the serial killer in order to obtain the wedding invitation. A mysterious video arrives at the wedding party from a friend of the groom. After watching the video, Megure suspects that the killer is already in the chapel and Conan suggests that the bride should meet with the guests in order to find the burglar who broke into her house. The bride reports that there are three suspicious guests: a photographer named Rinzo Gunji, a snowboarding instructor named Teigo Shimabukuro, and an internet administrator named Fukuharu Karube. The groom insists that the wedding continues, despite Megure's protests.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Resolution": "\nWhen Taira attempts to escape, he grabs the knife from Chiba and stabs \"Yumi\" who is actually Sato because they had traded places earlier since Sato had already realised Taira's true intentions and wanted to keep Yumi away from danger. Sato turns out to be fine because the wedding corset blocked the knife from penetrating, and she chases after Taira, but cannot go as fast as usual because of the dress's length.\nOutside, Takagi hears what's happening to Sato over the phone, so he rushes to the front of the church. Conan tries to take Taira but he doesn't have his super sneakers on, so he helps Ran take him down the moment he steps outside. Finally catching up, Sato mistakes Takagi for Taira, and she throws him down and pins him. Gunji captures this moment on film.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- The anime added a prolouge scene where Takagi had a dream that he is marrying with Yumi, Sato then congratulate him before throws him down, which cause him to wake up as he's also fall down from the bed.\n"
