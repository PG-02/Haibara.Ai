    "Situation": "While at a camping trip, The Detective Boys are surprisingly greeted by Masumi Sera. While the Professor sets up camp and Conan chats with Masumi, Ayumi, Genta, Haibara, and Mitsuhiko venture into the woods and come across a person burying a body.\n\nWhile the children run, Haibara alerts the police, and then they hide in a dark cabin, only to figure out it is where the culprit was earlier. To prevent them from talking, the culprit locks them in and sets the cabin blaze.\n\nInspector Yamamura arrives to the scene of the body, and later has three suspects. The only clue is a dying message of her fingers being in an odd form behind her back.\n",
