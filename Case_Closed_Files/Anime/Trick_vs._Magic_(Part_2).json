    "Situation": "A famous magician hires Kogoro to keep watch on his staff members, as he believes one of them may be out to kill him. For his first act, he lies on a bed of spikes, and is slammed with another, which has Kogoro and Conan worried until he's revealed to be alive. The next trick does not go so well, and he ends up trapped in a water tank where the entrance has been sealed. By the time it's open and he's rescued, it's too late, and one of his workers is responsible.\n\nConan fishes around for clues in hopes of finding the true culprit. After gaining info, he learns who's behind the trick, and exposes the true mastermind behind the death of the magician.\n",

    "Resolution": "Then, he got back to his normal place that's why they did not see anything strange on the video. Shoji did not use a pin, instead it was a trick ring, he got the ring and put around in one of the hinges and then he got the other ring in the hole and then he closed it. The ring he used is the ring on his left hand and the ring easily detaches so that he can attach the two parts on their opposite sides and which can then be closed. After that he distracted the others by letting Kogoro do the first aid and he got his ring back before someone noticed it.\n",
