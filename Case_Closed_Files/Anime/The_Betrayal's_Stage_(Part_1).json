    "People": "- Victim (hanged)\n- 39 years old\n- Rock musician\n- 40 years old\n- Rokumichi's manager and former lover\n- 58 years old\n- Record Label president\n- Rokumichi's friend\n- 51 years old\n- Magazine reporter\n- Hado's staff member\n- Ordered to throw Kajiya out\n- Tokyo MPD police officer\n- Tokyo MPD police officer\n",
    "Resolution": "The song ASACA is spelt with a \"CA\" instead of a \"KA\" because of their unborn child, he heard about her pregnancy in a \"CAFE at dawn (\"Asa\"), combining the words ASA and CA from café to make ASACA, which proves the song unrelated to the Case from 17 years ago.\nScotch's death is revealed to be a suicide, Akai convinced him not to, but after hearing Rei's approaching footsteps, believing them to be of one of the Organization's members, he chose to commit suicide, destroying his cellphone to prevent anyone from discovering his identity as well as to protect his family and friends.\nAt the end of the case, Rei seems getting close to discovering Subaru's identity as he told him he can't wait to fold down his turtleneck after he obtains real proof.\n\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the anime, Subaru takes part in the cleaning of Shinichi's house. He's wringing out a mop when he hears Sonoko say that the song \"ASACA\" is written with the letter \"c\", and not with the letter \"k\". Upon hearing this, Subaru drops the towel in the bucket of water. This wasn't in the manga.\n- In the anime, it's Sonoko who asks Conan if he wants to go with her and Ran to have a word with Rokumichi. In the manga, it was Ran.\n- In the manga, it's mentioned that Rokumichi would habitually pull all-nighters to work on song lyrics. He would make a conscious effort to stay up long enough to watch the sunrise with a coffee in hand. Okuyasu notes that he and Rokumichi bonded over mountain climbing. Following a concert, the two would set up camp after climbing and later watch the morning sunrise. These conversations are omitted from the anime.\n- Despite his membership in a mountain climbing club, Hirokazu claims he never learned how to tie a knot. His inability to tie a knot was not established in the anime version.\n- In the manga, Rokumichi's eyes are shown to be open after the body has been brought down. The medical examiner can be seen physically inspecting the body for rigor mortis and the eye for dilution. In the anime, his eyes are shut during examination and no mention is made of rigor mortis.\n- In the manga, it’s mentioned that Rokumichi had a blog. Hirokazu notes that the popular musician wrote about his desire to “die on stage” when his time came, suggesting that the murder was perhaps committed by a devoted fan. No mention of a blog is made in the anime.\n",
    "Trivia": "- In the \"See you next time\" sequence at the end of the episode, Amuro tells Akai that \"It's been a long time since the ferris wheel\". This is a reference to The Darkest Nightmare.\n- The names of the suspects are related to musical genres[1]:\n- Rokumichi Hado (波土 禄道) comes from \"hard rock\" (ハードロック hādo rokku);\n- Kanae Enjō (円城 佳苗) comes from \"enka\" (演歌);\n- Okuyasu Fuse (布施 憶康, フセ オクヤス in katakana) comes from \"folk music\" (フォーク, fōku);\n- Hirokazu Kajiya (梶谷 宏和, カジヤ ヒロカズ in katakana) comes from \"jazz\" (ジャズ, jazu).\n",
