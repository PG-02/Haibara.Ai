    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan arrive in a park in Tokyo where Ran told them to go. Arrived at the place, they discover the park is nice and charming. They also discover a watermill onlooking the river behind the park's restaurant. Even if it isn't used presently, it used to irrigate the nearby rice field and is now used as a natural icehouse where they make ice for the guests. As they are explained details of the park by the clerk, a group of three graduates who recognize Kogoro Mouri as the great detective. they then take selfies at the riverside to immortalize the moment. They then planned to organize different activities but the fun is quickly interrupted by a tragic event.\n\nWill the great detective impress the scholars and find the truth?\n",
    "People": "- 21 years old\n- Teito University English student\n- 21 years old\n- Teito University Philosophy student\n- Victim (drowned)\n- 21 years old\n- Teito University Education student\n- Tokyo Park clerk\n- Hostess\n- Japanese Itamae\n- Tokyo Park employee\n- Tokyo MPD Police officer\n",
    "Resolution": "Previously, Kogoro had been elaborating that the victim had died in an accident but Conan (a.k.a Sleeping Kogoro) tells that he was just doing an elaboration. First, he made the others remember that the selfie sticks location was strange since it was near the riverbed but since she slipped while trying to take a picture, she should've fallen in the river with her phone.\nIn conclusion, it was all placed to make it look like an accident by Yuko's killer. She lured her in the watermill by using a free texting service and then, the killer went there by her own to reach the victim. After meeting Yuko, the killer asked her about some tips to chat and convinced Yuko to go inside the storage room which the door's lock had been broken beforehand by the culprit.\nShe then struck Yuko with natural ice taken from the storage room and killed her. Proof of this is the presence of sawdust which was swept in order to hide footprints. The killer then used a cart to move the body and threw it into the river. She left the selfie stick and the phone to make it look like it was an accident. He tells them the killer is among them but the suspects replied by saying they were with him the moment they saw the body in the water.\nHe tells that it was a trick used by the culprit and had Takagi prepare the trick. The killer had opened a sluice not normally opened and the river swept the Azolla Japonica that was in the irrigation canal and that then flowed into the pool. The water then gathered in enough time for the killer to pretend to have been along with the others. Kogoro then tells them that the pools are naturally formed when sections of the river curve and separate from the main river and then flow back along with the corpse.\nThe murderer is Maria Suzumoto. The thorns Yuko had on her body stuck to her when the killer passed by some wild roses which meant the killer also had them. She then hides them trying to say she's not the culprit. Another piece of evidence is that she didn't have any band-aids before coming but she is now wearing some.\nTakagi then informs the group that forensics have found blood on one of the icehouse's block of ice. Having enough, she asks Kogoro where The solid evidence is and if he has any. The gloves she used to kill Yuko were still in her bag, as was afraid the police would find them so she kept them. Exposed, she confesses and tells them Yuko had been posting heinous comments on a picture sharing blog and that she was selfish. But suddenly, Juri slaps her and asks her: why didn’t she come talk to her, she could’ve helped her out. She tells Maria that she didn’t have to resort to this and that she could’ve counted on her friends. After this both women break down from losing their friendship.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Kakigōri is a japanese dessert made of shaved ice and flavored with syrup and a sweetener, often condensed milk.\n- The watermill appeared in a painting in Hatobue Lodge from Eyewitness Testimony Seven Years Later. Open spoiler box to see images.\n- There is a mistake in the ending credits as Maria Suzumoto's name is credited as Maria Suzuki (鈴木 麻里亜).\n"
