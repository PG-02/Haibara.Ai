    "Situation": "Sonoko, Ran, and Conan are at Kuwanoki High School to meet up with Eimi Chikada, who called Sonoko over because today (7/11) she received a warning letter that contained the initials EC, which she thought referred to herself. The letter said, \"EC will be brought to justice!\" She met Sonoko at her job and they became friends. She waves to them from above when suddenly she appears to get pulled down by someone. The three of them run toward a room with a door marked \"Orihime Club\", and they find her lying on the ground with bits of hair around. She tells them that someone pulled on one of her pigtails from behind and sliced her hair with a utility knife. Sonoko and Conan search around the school but could not find the culprit.\n\nThere were incidents that happened before today's. Three days ago (7/8), someone put chili inside Megumi Godai's (MG) bottle of juice.\n\nYesterday (7/10), someone put a toy spider inside Chie Tamai's (CT) backpack.\n\nAdditionally, there were warnings prior to those incidents. They contained the initials of the victims and the exact dates of the incidents. Written on the letters were \"MG will suffer my wrath!\" and \"CT will face retribution!\" Those warnings were sent to Orihime Club, which accept letters instead of emails. After Eimi was saved, she gives Sonoko a letter she just picked up. It says, \"TB dies at sundown tonight!\" With only about two hours before sunset, it's up to Sonoko, Ran, and Conan to investigate the incidents and expose the culprit.\n",
    "People": "- 17 years old\n- Kuwanoki High School 3rd year student\n- 16 years old\n- Prank victim\n- Kuwanoki High School 2nd year student\n- 18 years old\n- Prank victim\n- Kuwanoki High School 3rd year student\n- 17 years old\n- Kuwanoki High School 3rd year student\n",
    "Resolution": "With only one hour before sunset, Conan goes back to the room where Eimi was attacked to restart the investigation. The first strange thing Conan notices about the incident is the hair stuck to the window sill. Then he goes to the garden right below the room and finds a small, thin mark in the soil. After that, he comes back into the room and finds letters written by Megumi and Chie, both which begin with \"Dear Romeo\". It turns out Romeo referred to Yuto Kariya, a high school student who a lot of girls are madly in love with (Orihime Club received a ton of love letters written to him).\nSonoko, Ran, Conan, and Eimi head to the library to see Yuto doing homework while listening to music. When Sonoko asks Yuto where he had been an hour ago, he shows them a letter, written in the same handwriting as the previous three warning letters, that says: \"I found your utility knife. Meet me behind the gym so I can return it to you.\" He waited at that place for about five minutes, but since no one came, he returned to the library.\nAs they ponder outside the library, Conan realizes that the initials do not represent the names of the victims, but rather are related to Romeo and Juliet, since Orihime Club was named after Italy's Juliet Club. MG represents Montague and CT represents Capulet, since the two families, who only cared about their own reputation, did not allow Romeo's and Juliet's mutual love (hence the words \"wrath\" and \"retribution\" in the letters). EC represents Prince Escalus, who accused and banished Romeo for murder (hence the word \"justice\"). Finally, TB represents Tybalt, who killed Mercutio, Romeo's best friend, in a duel and ended up getting killed by Romeo.\nSonoko charges back into the library to find Yuto, who she thinks is the culprit, and Ran follows. As they run off, Conan turns around and realizes Eimi is already gone. In the library, Yuto is nowhere to be found, so Sonoko asks some girls nearby and learns the guidance counselor told him, via e-mail, he wanted to see him. Suddenly Ran asks Sonoko how Romeo killed Tybalt, and Sonoko tells her Tybalt died from a fencing duel. Sonoko remembers that Eimi, who is skilled in fencing, was asked to play Tybalt during last year's school festival, leading her and Ran to think Eimi is TB and Yuto is going to kill her.\nRan, Sonoko, and Conan split up to search for her. They finally find her and Yuto on the roof of the school but are surprised to see her pointing a utility knife at him. Conan puts Sonoko to sleep from above and reveals that Eimi Chikada was behind all of these pranks and wrote all of the warning letters. She actually did not get pulled down. She acted it out herself and cut her own hair with that same utility knife, which actually belongs to Yuto, to make it look like he attacked her. Afterwards, she threw the knife out the window, since there was no way he would keep it at the crime scene if he were the culprit. That is what created the mark in the flowerbed. Then, she e-mailed Yuto to call him up here, thus removing his alibi. If her plan succeeded, she would commit suicide, which was her true purpose, with that knife to make it look like he killed her. The reference to Romeo and Juliet was used to cover up her objective.\n\n",
