    "Situation": "Conan and the Detective Boys are playing soccer when they meet the calico cat, Taii, who frequently comes to Café Poirot for food. They follow the cat into a refrigerated delivery truck where the kids stumble on to a body in a box. The drivers killed the man and are doing their route to establish an alibi as the cold will alter the time of death.\n\nAlthough the Detective Boys have not been discovered by the delivery men, the cold begins to affect them, as Mitsuhiko even collapses from giving his sweater to Haibara. Conan uses a receipt to write a message and releases Taii from the truck with it stuck in its collar, hoping that Bourbon will find it and realize what is going on.\n",
