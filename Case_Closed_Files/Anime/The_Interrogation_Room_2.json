    "Situation": "At the MPD Asahidai Police Station, Kogoro roared in an exceedingly anxious tone to Inspector Megure - the reason was, that a culprit behind a murder case who he had assisted the Division 1 to arrest, whose name was Kengo Kitao, was invariably on stand-by mode in terms of the formal prosecution procedure. This definitely struck Kogoro puzzled and kept insisting on getting a justifiable answer for it. Confronting the out-of-mind-Kogoro, Megure sighed and showed the situation: strangely, Kitao admitted everything frankly, but regardless of how Takagi questioned him regarding the details to his crime, he was utterly speechless, yet decided to simply get by the inquiries utilising the fact of his aging. Conan who was also present in the interrogation room, sensed something odd as well.\nEights days ago, the police received an anonymous tip and discovered that, near a suspended construction area located in Asahidai, a seemingly abandoned car was parked and a body was seen within. The man who suffered was named Masato Honda, who apparently owned that car. He was first being fed with sleeping pills and was murdered thereafter.\n\nAfter seeing the newspaper reporting about the incident, Kogoro realised instantly, that the victim was clearly the one he had seen two days before, who was having an argument with an elderly man. Therefore, he decided to inform Megure right away. At the same time, Chiba brought another valuable piece of information: a person named Tamotsu Kambara precisely had witnessed a suspicious elderly man mandering around that construction area yesterday afternoon. After rendering a photo of that suspicious guy, Kogoro exclaimed and asserted that the man Kambara was referring to was the elderly man he saw the other day. Knowing the direction to investigate, the police went up digging further with regards to Kengo Kitao, they had confirmed his purchase of coal briquetts (element to conduct CO poisoning) at a certain general store. And - that was why they were in the interrogation questioning Kitao.\nAs everyone was stumbled by the stones of riddles, Chiba seemed to had brought some shards of hope, as he found another person who possessed a plausible motive, that is, the victim's aunt, Haruka Yomo. Yomo was frequently extorted by her nephew, and at the same time, Yomo was also friends who attended a haiku workshop together. Judging by Kitao's irrational words uttered within the interrogation room, Kogoro suspected that it could be possible if Kitao thought Yomo may had done it, and in order to protect her, he admitted the crime himself. Megure thereupon inquired of Kitao about it, yet Kitao constantly denied about it. However, after hearing the fact that Yomo actually had an alibi on the day of crime, Kitao's expressions transformed rapidly. He then gave up on insisting, and confessed that he requested Kambara to give false eyewitness testimony.\nOn the other end, Kambara also admitted that Kitao implored him to do so. Since Kitao was his teacher back then, Kambara agreed with it without thinking. In addition, Kambara also declared that Kitao was at his house from 10 AM to 2 PM all day; hence, it would be impossible for him to carry out that murder anyways.\nConan then pointed out a doubt: according to the security camera recorded, Kitao bought the coal briquetts before the murder. With this question in mind, they enquired Kitao once again. To tell the truth, Kitao confessed - initially, he was planning to kill Honda. One day by chance, Kitao learned the fact that Honda had been blackmailing his aunt for money regularly; as a friend of her, he would not let him at large, at all. After Honda left, Kitao also heard Yomo saying \"if only Masato (Honda) weren't around\". As a result, Kitao was determined to murder Honda so he went to the general store and purchased the coal briquetts. To make it seem totally irrelevant to Haruka Yomo, Kitao fabricated a separate motive: and so the fight with Honda that Kogoro witnessed was instigated. Before himself carrying out the crime, he read in the morning that Honda had already been murder by someone else; he went in panic. Consequently he disposed of all the equipment bought in preparation for his murder, and came to Kambara for an eyewitness testimony. Megure considered Kitao's thinking extremely incredulous, and therefore asked him if he liked Yomo. Kitao admitted but claimed it to be one-sided only.\nBy searching within the pond, the police were able to find the coal briquetts which Kitao disposed of earlier, which exactly matched with his testimonies. Later on, Megure declared Kitao's innocence upon the murder case but his behaviour of obstruction of justice for the past weeks would still need to be investigated further, yet the priority at the moment was the murder case itself. After hearing that Kitao went flustered, he requested Megure to indict him right away. On the other side of the room, Kogoro and Conan perceived some strangeness: why was Kitao in such a rush?\nAbruptly, Conan realised something - it would be highly impossible that the method of killing thought up by Kitao happened to be the exact identical one utilised by the other culprit, this also woke Kogoro up. To conclude his deduction, Conan proclaimed that Kitao must be the culprit, and now, it would be their job to investigate the howdunnit behind the case.\nThey again consulted Kambara, and learned that on the day of murder, Kitao and he was invariably reminiscing some past-year photos all day long, considering the fact that his house was situated in Hikage Town, to that construction area where the victim's car in Asahidai, would require one hour of driving, seeing Kitao doing this would not be possible. However, Kambara disclosed that Kitao had left once mid-way, but that was to buy some cigarets, which only took ten minutes or so. Leaving Kambara's house, they went to see Yomo; they learned from her that Kitao apparently knew she was going to have an alibi on the day of murder, as once she talked about her trip at haiku workshop and Kitao was obviously remarking about it too. Also, Conan confirmed with her about Kitao's hearsay \"If Masato weren't around\", Yomo indeed had said that, but she answered that the implication of that sentence was not what Kitao thought.\nEven though Kogoro had started to believe that Kitao was innocent, Conan was certain that Kitao was the culprit; final evidences were in need. He pondered for some time and realised that since the cause of death was Carbon Monoxide poisoning, the crime scene would not necessarily just be the construction area in Asahidai. Going through some buildings situated around Kambara's house, he was particularly searching for buildings that were in reach within five minutes (since Kitao was missing for ten minutes, one-way journey would be five minutes); successfully, Conan found an abandoned factory that could be approached in merely three minutes...\n",

    "Resolution": "",
    "\"Two Birds With One Stone\"": "Kogoro asked Megure to prepare a speaker to be placed in the main interrogation room and Kogoro (along with Conan) would be staying in the other side. Conan thus tranquilised Kogoro and began the deduction:\nThe culprit behind the case was Kengo Kitao, he plotted the murderer and be arrested, then overturn his arrest, and escape suspicion. He did this intentionally as that way his suspicion upon this murder would had been eliminated. To do all of these, Kitao first needed to know that Yomo had an alibi on that day. Then, he deliberately purchased the coal briquetts under the security cameras so his presence can be noticed afterwards by the police. Most likely, he threw everything away right after he made the purchase. The purchase of materials that he utilised in the genuine murder was done in another store.\nOn the day of murder, Kitao first dragged Honda with sleeping pills and drove him to Kambara's house in Hikage Town. Before arriving, he parked his car in that abandoned factory with the unconscious Honda inside. After that, he stayed in Kambara's house for the entire morning, until 2 PM. During the ten minutes he went to \"but cigarets\", he in fact returned to that abandoned factory and ignited the coal briquetts with the stove to murder Honda, this way he could fake the time of death of the victim. Then, he drove back to Asahidai. At that construction area, he ignited the stove once again and released Carbon Monoxide for one final attempt, this was to create an illusion that the victim was really killed in Asahidai.\nAfter killing Honda, what he had to do was only to report anonymously to the police and request Kambara to do a fake eyewitness testimony. By leading the police to suspect him, his plan would succeed. After luring the police to think that he was only protecting Yomo, he would then be indicted and interviewed by several talk shows. And this was his second intent - to confess his feeling to Yomo on television. This was the reason why he panicked when he knew that he would not be indicted right away.\n",
    "Truth About The Words": "Not only because of talk shows that Kitao wanted to attended by plotting this murder, but also that the victim had been persistently extorting him as well - Honda was planning to reveal Kitao's love towards Yomo, based on that, he demanded money from Kitao. Killing Honda would simultaneously end two blackmailing incidents: both on him and on Yomo.\nHowever, Sleeping Kogoro impeded him. As he knew what \"If Masato weren't around\" actually meant. Not that Yomo wanted Honda to disappear, but rather, she was actually in love with someone who was younger than Honda, so she felt somewhat embarrassed about it in front of her nephew.\nHaving known that he had wrongly killed a person, Kitao kneeled down affectionally with remorse.\n",
