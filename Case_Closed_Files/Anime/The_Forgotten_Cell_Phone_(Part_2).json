    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "While Kogoro and Conan were taking break in a coffee shop below the Detective Agency, Azusa Enomoto asked for Kogoro's help. A customer left his cellphone two days ago and Azusa wanted to return it. While searching for clues about the customer's whereabouts, Yumi, a police officer, came and they found out that they were investigating about the same person. They later found out that the man they were looking for died in a car accident.\n\nAfter some investigation by Conan, Kogoro, and Yumi, there are able to locate the identity of the killed man, as well as the secrets of the cell phone. Conan figures out that the numbers are not real contacts, but are very important pieces of confidential and scandalous information.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (car accident)\n- Investigative reporter\n- Cell-phone owner\n- Violent-looking man\n- Man with square-shaved head\n- Man wearing sunglasses\n- Diet member\n- Café Columbo chef\n- JR Beika Station employee\n- Woman who wrongly called Kogoro's phone\n- Yuka's boyfriend\n- Apollo Sports employee\n- JR Beika Station manager\n- Man 6's boss\n- High School student\n- Café Poirot customer\n",
    "Resolution": "",
    "Trivia": "- The truck crash cell-phone owner is a 2002 Toyota Dyna.\n- This is the first case with Azusa Enomoto since The Client Full of Lies. She has been given another major makeover in design and this is her first official canon appearance.\n- This appears to be the first case, where Kogoro uses the honorific \"-kun\" when addressing Conan. Most of the characters refer to him as \"Conan-kun\"; Kogoro uses no honorific.\n- This is one of the first cases where Kogoro begins and ends the case with a narrative.\n- This case marks one of the first encounters that Kogoro has with Yumi. When he sees her, he remarks how she's always with Takagi, so he may be unaware that she is traffic and not homicide.\n- In this case, Azusa reveals that the owner of Cafe Poirot coffee shop is a fan of mystery novels, and Hercule Poirot.\n- This is the first case that features Azusa and Yumi for any length of time.\n- This is the first case that takes place primarily at Cafe Poirot. Until this case, the cafe has only appeared in a short scene. This fact is interesting due to this coffee shop being located directly underneath the Mouri Detective Agency, and supposedly frequented by Kogoro, Ran, and Conan.\n",
