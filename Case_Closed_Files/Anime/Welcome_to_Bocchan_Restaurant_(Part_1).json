    "Situation": "\n\nWhile investigating, the police find out the suspects have personalities very different from the characters they play: Bocchan didn't care about justice, Nodaiko had serious anger issues, Yama Arashi was a crybaby, Madonna was in fact a skilled fighter and Red shirt did in fact care for his customers. Also, Kiyo is later revealed to not be a modest old woman, and also smokes. The next day Conan and his friends search for any clues that might have been left by the culprit in the park. They found some blood stains in a corner. To inform about the situation, they went to restaurant only to find out that the manager Red shirt had died.\n\nConan decides to investigate by himself and finally figures out the truth.\n",
