    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "After visiting an exhibit on hidden treasures Conan and his friends find a piece of paper with symbols and the word \"Oro\" written on it. A treasure hunt ensues but does not discover much. Conan, initially not interested in the children's treasure hunt finally realizes that the paper is a treasure map after learning that \"Oro\" means gold in Italian. That night, Conan determines that the symbols refer to neon light signs on buildings.\n\n",
    "People": "- Italian crime boss\n- Cavane's Italian crime ring second-in-command\n- Cavane's Italian crime ring member\n- Cavane's Italian crime ring member\n- TV announcer\n",
    "Resolution": "- There's no doubt that Dino Cavane and his accomplices are responsible for the theft of the Maple Leaf coins, but Cavane refuses to say where the coins are hidden.\n- Conan and the Detective Boys find a piece of paper with odd symbols drawn on it and the word \"ORO\" as they leave a museum.\n- After looking at an Italian-Japanese dictionary, Conan realizes \"ORO\" means \"Gold\" in Italian. Conan is shocked to realize he and the Detective Boys really did find a treasure map.\n- Conan is puzzled why someone who is Italian would make a reference to a Japanese street name near Tohto Tower.\nConan realizes that the shapes on the treasure map really refer to the shapes of neon signs near Tohto Tower. It wouldn't make sense for someone who does not speak Japanese to make a reference to a Japanese named street, but rather draw pictures of a recognizable objects they saw.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- An entire portion of the story is left out of the anime where Ran takes Conan, Genta, Ayumi, and Mitsuhiko to Tohto Tower. She recalls a time when she and Shinichi visited the tower and when he bought her a cold drink, which he put up to her cheek. Conan does the same thing, which prompts her to ask him about his true identity (as the manga version takes place after the The Shinkansen's Bomb Case). Conan responds by stating that he is Kamen Yaiba. The scene in question would later appear (ironically) at the begining of the fourth movie Captured in Her Eyes which Ran has a flashback too.\n- In the manga, Genta envisions that the Italian gangsters will shoot him, and imagines himself lying in a pool of his own blood. The anime substitutes a less graphic and more stylized image, with a miniature Genta being riddled with colorful, cartoon-like gunshots.\n- In the manga, the 4th sign in the paper is a bowtie instead of an umbrella in the anime. The word \"ORO\" and the fish sign is in different sides.\n- In the manga, Conan notices ahead of time that they are being followed by the Italian gangsters, so he tosses the map pretending to know nothing about it and sends the kids home. After the gangsters leave, Conan is revealed to have made a copy of the map and uses it to try and find the treasure but the kids figure him out and force him to let them cooperate.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This episode marks canon day 8 of Shinichi's life as Conan.\n- Dino Cavane is modeled after Al Capone.\n- A remastered version of the case was aired in June 6, 2009.\n"
