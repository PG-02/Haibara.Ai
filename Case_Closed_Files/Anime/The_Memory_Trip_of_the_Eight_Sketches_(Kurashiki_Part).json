They then meet the woman who suffered in post-traumatic amnesia and decide to assist her in regaining her memories. The woman sketches out pictures which gives them clues on locations she visited. The woman recognizes the sound of a suikinkutsu from a cellphone. The group deduces she visited the Salt Palace. There, she discovers her name to be Mayuko Kichise from her friend, Kanae Nonomiya. Nonomiya reveals Kichise is an important witness who can prove her brother did not rob a jewelry store and prompts her to regain her memories.\n\nNonomiya tells them the location of Kichise's home where they find it had been searched and pictures of Kichise and her boyfriend were ripped. Later at a restaurant, Kichise receives a note demanding her to be alone if she wants her memories. She separates from the group and is approached by a masked stranger.\nThe masked stranger attempts to kill Kichise but is interrupted by Conan.\n\nThe group continue following the locations suggested by the sketches and arrive in Kurashiki. After a second masked stranger's failed kidnapping attempt on Kichise.\n",
