    "Situation": "A woman named Takako Nakajima requested Kogoro to find her missing husband, Hiroshi Nakajima, who had just vanished and lost contact with her three days ago. According to Takako, they have been married for four years, and she described her husband as an earnest man. Takako brought a box with her husband's belongings to the detective agency to serve as clues. There were some business cards of Hiroshi's, three framed photos, and a computer he used. The first photo was taken during their honeymoon; the second photo was taken when Hiroshi went diving some time ago; the third photo was taken within the family. As Takako explained in her note, the man who was standing beside her husband when diving was his coworker, Nishimura. And the man who appeared in the family photo was his younger brother, Ryu. When Kogoro opened Hiroshi's computer, he saw that the background wallpaper was a bunch of sharks. And when he went through the browser history, what he found were an online cruiser store, luxury cars, luxury watches, and cottages with an aquarium. After knowing some information related to Hiroshi, Kogoro decided to start the investigation at least.\nHiroshi worked for an apparel firm, therefore, Kogoro and Conan visited there. However, the front desk lady uttered that there isn't anybody in the firm called Hiroshi Nakajima, which forced Kogoro to consult Hiroshi's coworker who appeared in that diving photo. Nishimura was still at work and wore a grey suit and a red tie, looking rather formal. He also equipped a ball-like earring with a redish colour. What he said chocked both of them... Hiroshi quit the firm six months ago already! Although he was quite close to Hiroshi, he still had no idea what had happened to him. Just as Kogoro and Conan were leaving the firm building, the front desk lady secretly approached Kogoro and told him the truth. She actually saw in the scenario how Hiroshi insisted on quitting the company and scolded how exploitative his boss is. Kogoro still did not get any decisive information for the case, but Conan hinted to him that there were still two people that they could contact with: the dive shop owner and Hiroshi's younger brother Ryu. Kogoro phoned the owner of that dive shop \"Ocean Blue\", Isao Yamauchi. He said that he remembered Hiroshi and claimed that he used to work for the dive shop, and also about how keen he was on sharks. Nevertheless, he stopped going there four years ago due to the high cost of diving, as he only got to spend 2000 yen per month. After that, they reached Hiroshi's brother, Ryu. He discloed about how Takako is strict with her husband Hiroshi, that she only deploys 2000 yen for Hiroshi to spend every month; and that whenever Hiroshi went out, he was also forced to share photos and contact her every two hours, and that was only the tip of the iceberg for all the rules she set for Hiroshi.\nDespite the fact that Hiroshi had quit his job six months ago, his wife Takako did not believe it. Since she had installed GPS on his phone to track Hiroshi's activity at all times, And she did not notice anything queer from six months ago until the present. He went to his firm, arrived at home timely, and deposited his salary money as usual. The GPS also indicated that Hiroshi was always inside his office at the firm. While Kogoro was still scratching his head to solve the mystery, Conan had already figured out the location where Hiroshi had been staying for the past six months. Owing to the display of the GPS, it would always be on a 2D map, it would only tell you the location but not the altitude. Accordingly, the place where Hiroshi stayed after he quit his job must be in the exact same place as his office, but on a different floor. When Kogoro and Conan visited the firm building, Conan realised that the basement of the building was rented out. Therefore, he could boldly deduce that Hiroshi was in the basement of that building. When they got there, what first came into their sight was a huge aquarium, along with some fish and sharks swimming briskly inside. In front of the aquarium, they found a camera that was being supported by a tripod, alongside a broken phone. The film inside the camera recorded everything Hiroshi did after he got unemployed. He explained how he longed for having a secret basement filled with aquariums,  how he reinforced the room to fit the aquarium and fish, and, most important matter... how he managed to get the money to do so. He in fact put all of his allowance money from every month towards the year-end lottery, and luckily, he won one billion yen last year! After some deep contemplations, he then decided to pursue his dream and spend all the money towards the construction of his dream aquarium. This also matched the fact that he loved seeing hammer-head sharks. After seeing the little film, Kogoro and Conan fully understood what Hiroshi was doing in this basement. Without his wife's acknowledgment, he built the palace of his dreams. However, just at the same time, Conan noticed a floating corpse inside the aquarium. And when they looked closely, it was... Hiroshi Nakajima. Kogoro called the police immediately, and Conan saw a shiny ball that remained on the bottom of the aquairum.\n\n",

    "Resolution": "",
    "Humanity or Money?": "The sleeping Kogoro instructed to bring Hiroshi's coworker, Masa Nishimura, to the secret basement. Takagi got surprised and remarked \"you've identified the culprit right off the bat today\". When Nishimura arrived, he pretended to not recognise the place and asked where he was. The sleeping Kogoro went on: The victim won one billion yen, and he took some consideration upon it, regarding how to spend it. He looked up online cruiser store, luxury watches, luxury cars, but did not interest him, therefore, he gave hope on top of the aquarium under his firm. Nishimura, as a close coworker of Hiroshi, supported Hiroshi's proposal of building a aquarium under the firm building. Because from the photo of Hiroshi diving, Nishimura who was standing beside him also seemed quite fond of diving. By insticating his coworker to build one just below his firm, it would be handy and he could experience it for free everyday. Later on, Nishimura learned that Hiroshi got one billion yen and he wanted a share. So he began to blackmail Hiroshi, or else he would expose it to Hiroshi's strict wife. The plan did not work eventually so Nishimura killed Hiroshi while diving in the aquarium.\nNishimura got a bit upset and uttered: \"That's just speculation, I didn't know about his secret base, and I've never been here before\". Conan then showed evdience to Nishimura for the deduction. He opened the film stored in the camera, and they realised that in the beginning, the camera was being held on a tripod to make it stand. But afterwards, the camera moved downwards when Hiroshi was about to show the one billion yen he won. This means afterwards somebody was holding the camera while filming. The filmer must be the one who was helping Hiroshi to build this secret basement. It must be Nishimura because he was the only one that knew the presence of the aquairum basement. The relative proof of it would be Nishimura's speech when he arrived at this secret basement, if he was innocent, he would not have known that this place was Hiroshi's secret basement.\nFinally, Chiba found the decisive evidence for Nishimura commiting the crime, which was Nishimura's earring. It was remained at the bottom of the aquarium, it must have dropped during their combat. And according to the building's security camera footage, three days ago he had come to this building and had both the earrings equipped. But one of the earrings went missing when he came out. The reason he killed Hiroshi was because that he wanted a share and the victim did not accept.\n",
