    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "A baffling and seemingly impossible murder is committed at a secluded Mount Takao temple. Luckily Conan and Kogoro are on the scene. It is believed that the terrible Mist Goblin (Kiritengu), a creature with super strength, haunts the temple. Conan doesn't believe in goblins, but he may have to change his tune as the evidence suggests that the Mist Goblin may be more than just a legend.\n\n\n",
    "People": "- Victim (hanged)\n- 71 years old\n- Sandei Temple highpriest\n- 21 years old\n- Monk\n- 19 years old\n- Monk\n- 19 years old\n- Monk\n- 18 years old\n- Monk\n- Deceased (hanged)\n- Former monk\n- 21 years old\n- Tenei's grand-daughter\n- Chunen's friend\n- Kikuno's husband\n- Former monk\n",
    "Resolution": "\nShunen was always suspicious of Tenei and the other monks, so he hid his identity and entered the monastery to gain their trust and learn what had happened to his brother. He spent six months quietly snooping around, managing to more or less figure out how the murder was committed, but not the identity of the killer.\nShunen confronted Tenei right after the Mouris and Conan had gone to bed, having noticed how he had openly spoken about the Chunen incident when prior to that no one had ever mentioned it. Under the effects of alcohol, Tenei told Shunen everything. The young novice begged his superior to turn himself in, but Tenei refused and said he'd rather let everyone think the Mist Goblin took Chunen's life, since such a \"mystery\" had let him raise the fame of the monstery. Shunen then lost it and used his new found knowledge to kill Tenei in the same way Chunen died: he grabbed a rope, wrapped it around Tenei's neck, and pulled it as if he was carrying a heavy bag on his back: the \"bag\" being, of course, Tenei.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- The anime version starts off with Conan, Ran and Kogoro looking at the cherry blossom trees, as well as Conan recaps his first encounter with Gin and Vodka. The scene ends with Conan, Ran, and Kogoro having their picture taken.\n",
    "Continuity error": "Conan mentioned his first encounter with Gin and Vodka in the episode. However, the anime staff replaced Gin and Vodka with random criminals in The Shinkansen's Bomb Case, which means he shouldn't have known their codenames at this point of the anime.\n",
    "Translation changes": "",
    "Anime": "- The names of the characters and places in the Funimation Dub are:\n- Priest Tenei - Bonzai Tenei\n- Kikuno - Caitlin\n- Sandei Temple - Bendei Temple\n- Conan didn't mention Gin and Vodka's names, although at this point of the anime he already knew their names in English dub for Diplomat Murder Case via Heiji.\n",
    "Rerun": "The episode was rerun on June 28, 2004. It was unchanged except for the addition of a new scene at the beginning.\n",
    "Trivia": "- In the international version, not only the episode was split up into two parts, but the second part also used Nazo and its opening animation as the opening song instead of Feel Your Heart's.\n- This is the second 1 hour special. Moonlight Sonata Murder Case was the first.\n- This is one of the few cases in which Conan solves the case as the Sleeping Kogoro without the use of his wristwatch stun gun, as Kogoro slips and falls, knocking himself out in the process.\n"
