    "Situation": "Kogoro, along with Conan, is invited to the wedding of the son of a man who met at a bar he frequents, but suddenly the bride, Sayoko Imamura, says that she doesn't feels well and collapses. She was poisoned.\n\nThere are numerous suspects that said supsicious things when the murder happened. But who is the real culprit and what is the motive behind this tragedy on a happy day?\n",
    "People": "- Victim (poison)\n- 24 years old\n- Housekeeper\n- Bride\n- 28 years old\n- Office worker\n- Groom\n- 23 years old\n- Wedding planner\n- 58 years old\n- Priest\n- 27 years old\n- Office worker\n- Shinpo's friend\n- 23 years old\n- Office worker\n- Sayoko's friend\n- 57 years old\n- Executive\n- Shinpo's father\n- Sayoko's friend\n- Sayoko's friend\n- Shinpo's dog\n- Chihuahua\n- Izakaya employee\n- Wedding staff\n- Tokyo MPD CSI officer\n",
    "Resolution": "- Nobuteru Yokoyama hired a detective and he discovered Sayoko's history with men, but his son didn't listen to it.\n- Sayoko two timed Shinpo with Gakuto Yamada, and with Sayoko dead Gakuto will be able to get a new love.\n- Hiroko Nagashima was angry at the bride's decisions during the wedding preparations.\n- Naho Mizuguchi, who was the victim's friend since school complained how she (the victim) had numerous boyfriends and broke up with them after. That's why she said that Sayoko got what she deserved and knew something terrible will happen to her.\nIt turns out the poisoned food were the chocolates, and the groom's father becomes the main suspect. But Conan notices something strange, and after asking the wedding planner Hiroko Nagashima about her schedule and finding some clues, he solves the case.\nThe culprit followed Nobuteru to the shop where he buys a chocolate for the victim, after that the culprit buys the same chocolate but poisons it to frame the victim's father-in-law for the murder. The true culprit is Alex Harutoshi Kawasu, who manipulated the leash of the dog and hided a shoe from the bride to delay the ceremony and make the victim die when the couple kiss (13:45), but instead she died before (13:22). That's also what he meant with the statement he said \"It's too soon\", talking about the time of death, so after that he changed the phrase by saying that she was too young. He also keeps the poisoned chocolates because it will seem suspicious to throw them away in front of people. He wants to avenge his son, who was one of Sayoko's numerous boyfriends, who after being dumped by her, he had a traffic accident and died. He tries to committing suicide with a hidden poison bottle, but he is stopped by Conan with his soccer ball.\n\n- Mativa chocolate shop clerk\n- Deceased (traffic accident)\n- Alex Harutoshi's son\n- Sayako's ex-boyfriend\n\n",
    "Trivia": "- The title of this episode (死が二人を分かつまで) pays homage to the mystery novel written by John Dickson Carr, named Till Death Do Us Part, in which the Japanese translation of the novel is \"死が二人をわかつまで\".\n"
