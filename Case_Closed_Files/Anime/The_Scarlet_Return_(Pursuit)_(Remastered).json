    "Bourbon vs. FBI (Manga: 891-893, Anime: 779-780)": "This episode begins with a flashback outside Haido Central Hospital, where Tooru Amuro obtains information from Detective Takagi regarding Rikumichi Kusuda and deduces that Rikumichi was shot by a gun.\nAt the present, Natsuko Shibuya, a teacher at Haido Elementary School, receives a call from Jodie Starling while grading math tests at night. Natsuko tells Jodie she needed to meet with some parents soon after. After the conversation, Andre Camel asks Jodie about Natusko, and Jodie tells him that Natusko was her acquaintance. Natsuko was involved in a case while studying abroad in America, and Jodie helped her out. Jodie also reveals that she was able to go undercover in Japan as an English teacher because Natsuko taught her Japanese.\nMeanwhile, Tooru Amuro and Vermouth are inside a white car, waiting for Natsuko, who is actually his client and can potentially help him deduce the truth behind Shuichi Akai's death. Suddenly, they hear the sound of someone falling, and he sees a silhouette of another person on top of the stairs of Haido Park. They get off the car, only to see Natusko fainting at the bottom of the stairs; in other words, the person on top of the stairs was the culprit that attacked her.\n\nThe next day, after school, Conan boards Jodie's car to warn her and the FBI to not leak out any information regarding the death of Rikumichi, since Tooru Amuro is conducting his own investigation. Conan also wanted to tell her something else about him, but she gets interrupted by a call. On the phone, Takagi tells her that Natusko is severely injured and that she needs to head to the crime scene right away. The police already called Andre out before she arrived at Haido Park, since last night she had to call Natsuko with his phone because hers was out of power.\nWhile they were investigating the crime, the police mention they knew Natsuko was a teacher. Conan asks them how they knew, and Takagi tells him that inside her bag were a bunch of graded answer sheets. From this Conan deduces that Natsuko was not attacked at Haido Park, but actually at school; teachers are not supposed to bring graded sheets home, as that would leak out the students' personal information. Even if teachers bring the tests home, none of the tests should be graded. They immediately head to Haido Elementary School to investigate further.\nThe police search up Natsuko's call history again and found three suspects: Yoshiharu Sugamoto, Akiyo Ueno, and Fumiyuki Kandachi. From the luminol reaction on Natusko's desk, they conclude she in fact was attacked at school. While the police were questioning the suspects, Tooru Amuro comes into the teacher's office, which completely surprised Conan. After finding out that Jodie and Andre were FBI agents, Amuro begins to insult the FBI. This enraged Andre Camel, not just because of the insult, but also because in the past Amuro tried to do something bad to Shuichi Akai. Jodie manages to quell his rage so that Amuro would not know the FBI is aware that Amuro is a Black Organization member. Inspector Megure and Detective Takagi learn that Amuro was the one who reported Natusko's incident, is investigating her stalker, and is acting as her bodyguard.\nInspector Megure and Detective Takagi question the three suspects again, this time in further detail. After this, they, Jodie, Andre, Amuro, and Conan examine the picture containing Natsuko's graded tests. Amuro and Conan immediately figure out who the culprit is.\nBefore the case is solved, Amuro taunts the two FBI agents once again, and he tells them: \"I wish you'd get out... of my Japan.\" Conan notices that strange line and pulls Amuro to a corner, asking if Amuro is an enemy of the bad guys (referring to the Black Organization), but Amuro tells him he got the wrong idea.\nAt this point, Conan seems to know Amuro's real identity: he is actually a member of the Security Police. However, Conan is concerned that if he actually gets the wrong idea, Shuichi's faked death plan will be revealed to the Black Organization. Conan does know that there is still one piece of information Amuro does not know about, and that Amuro will do anything to obtain it.\nAs Amuro solves the case, Conan suddenly wonders why the FBI agents and a Black Organization member somehow met up at the same crime scene. He pulls Jodie and Andre over and asks them a few questions. Jodie tells him that last night Natsuko sent an email to her asking whether they can go drinking, but Natsuko told her during the call that she does not recall sending such an email. Conan figures out what is going on, but before he can tell Jodie, Amuro, who knew what he was doing, interrupts them. Amuro and Conan proceed to reveal the culprit.\n- Victim (bludgeoned - injured)\n- 28 years old\n- Haido Elementary School teacher\n- 30 years old\n- Haido Elementary School teacher\n- 39 years old\n- Parent of child\n- 41 years old\n- Parent of child\n- Tokyo MPD CSI officer\n- Haido Elementary School teacher\n- Haido Elementary School teacher\n- Haido Elementary School teacher\n",
    "The Truth of Shuichi Akai's Death (Manga: 894-898, Anime: 781-783)": "Andre meets up with Jodie and Conan only to realize that the Jodie he talked to previously was Vermouth. Because Andre leaked out the fact that Rikumichi shot himself, Amuro now knows that Shuichi indeed faked his death.\nBack at the hospital, Conan explained to Andre and Jodie that they had completely fallen for Amuro and Vermouth's plan. The plan went as follows:\nAt one point, Amuro took Natsuko's phone and sent an email to Jodie asking if they can go drinking. This was fairly easy because Natusko was Amuro's client. The purpose of sending that message is to force Jodie to use Andre's phone to call Natsuko at night, as Amuro predicted Jodie's phone would be dead by then. That way, both Andre and Jodie will be called to the crime scene after the police examine Natusko's call history. While they were outside investigating, Vermouth easily would have a chance to secretly take pictures of Jodie and prepare a perfect disguise. Even if Kandachi did not attack Natsuko, Amuro and Vermouth would try to injure her outside, and the result would be the same.\nThey would then call to tell Jodie that Natusko is in critical condition, thus bringing her and Andre to the hospital and separating them. When Jodie and Conan charged toward Natusko's room, Amuro provoked Andre by calling him a lowly investigator. That way, when Vermouth, who is dressed up as Jodie, pulls Andre away, he would lower his guard and accidentally leak out information regarding Rikumichi Kusuda.\nWhen Andre told Jodie and Conan that he leaked out the fact that Rikumichi shot himself, Conan was in complete shock (to the point where he did not notice Jodie calling out his name multiple times), because he knows that Amuro completely figured out Shuichi's faked death. As Amuro and Vermouth were driving, he explains to her that Shuichi is still alive, but she finds that idea ridiculous, since Shuichi's \"death\" was recorded by a camera attached to Kir. He tells her that once he finds a lead, he can find Shuichi in less than a day.\nThe next day, the Detective Boys find out that Conan is not coming to school because he had a cold, according to Haibara. However, she knows that Conan is up to something because she saw him talking to Professor Agasa privately. Towards evening, Ran was in the middle of cooking dinner when she wanted to ask Conan when the Macademy Awards start. Unfortunately, Kogoro tells her that he went to eat dinner at the professor's house. When Kogoro asks her why she wants to watch them, she tells him that it is because Yusaku Kudo was nominated for Best Original Script.\nAt night, Subaru Okiya is in Shinichi's house, watching the Macademy Awards and having some tea. Someone rings the doorbell and tells Subaru that it was from delivery. However, when he opens the door, Amuro appears before his eyes. While they talk, Amuro's colleagues are waiting right outside the front gate.\nMeanwhile, Jodie and Andre are driving toward Raiha Pass, the place where Shuichi \"died\". Jodie thinks they might find something there because she noticed Conan's strange behavior while investigating Natsuko's incident and his shock from earlier in this episode. They do not notice that someone is sitting in the back of the car.\nLater, Jodie and Andre realize they were being followed, so he sped up the car. As they discussed where Shuichi might be, Jodie guesses that Shuichi was most likely Subaru because they both talk about the odds being 50/50: in other words, their styles of speech were similar. Amuro also comes to that conclusion, after a bit of research, and informs Subaru that his colleagues are currently trying to capture the two FBI agents. Amuro then tells Subaru to remove his mask and reveal his true identity, which Amuro seems certain that it is Shuichi Akai. As Jodie and Andre attempt to escape, they see a barricade of cars up ahead. Andre somehow makes it through by clipping the right side of the car onto a mountain slope, making the car tip and roll forward on two wheels.\nAfter Subaru removes the mask, Amuro is not satisfied and tells him to remove his entire disguise, leaving Subaru confused. Just then, at Mouri Detective Agency, Ran sees on television that Yusaku Kudo won the award for Best Original Script; however, Kogoro sits in front of the TV, drunk and asleep.\nAndre made it past the barricade, but he damaged the car's right tire in the process; as a result, Amuro's colleagues have a second chance to capture him and Jodie. Back at Shinichi's house, Amuro notices that there are ten surveillance cameras in the house. It turns out that Conan is hiding in a room in that house, observing Amuro carefully. Amuro's colleagues are getting closer and closer to Jodie and Andre's car, but he could not speed up any further. Amuro tells Subaru to take off his choker voice changer, since he thinks that Shuichi is using it to act out a completely different man. However, when he removed Subaru's turtleneck, he was surprised to see it was not there.\nAmuro's colleagues are now right beside Jodie and Andre's car. Just when everything seems over, someone in the back tells Andre to open the roof of the car. They are shocked to see that the one sitting in the back was actually Shuichi Akai. Even Amuro's colleagues could not believe it, so they pull back and call Amuro to tell him that Shuichi is actually in that car.\nThe FBI agents return to meet up with Amuro's colleagues. Shuichi borrows a colleague's phone to talk to Amuro, and in exchange he gives them the gun he just fired at them, which turned out to be the one Rikumichi Kusuda used to shoot himself. After all, Amuro's colleagues are better suited to examine that gun than the FBI are. Knowing that Amuro revealed his nickname to be \"Zero\" to Conan, Shuichi reveals his real name to be Rei Furuya. Shuichi had already suspected him as a Black Organization member long before his real name was revealed. Back when Shuichi was working undercover, Bourbon had attempted to turn him over in order to get into the heart of the organization. Shuichi tells him that they shouldn't lose sight of the real prey in their hunt, and that he doesn't want Rei as an enemy. Shuichi also tells him he still feels sorry for that guy. After the conversation, Amuro and his colleagues, with their identities exposed, stop pursuing the FBI agents.\nAfter Rei and his colleagues leave, Subaru meets up with Conan. Here, Subaru at that time is revealed to actually be Yusaku Kudo, and the man receiving the Best Original Script award is actually Yukiko Kudo in disguise, wearing a choker voice changer. Conan tells his father that the FBI agent will come back to live in the Kudo's house, as there is someone that person must protect.\nThe next day, Yukiko comes home to remake the Subaru Okiya disguise. Subaru Okiya was actually Shuichi Akai all along, and Jodie and Andre are shocked to see Shuichi in disguise. Even though Rei was fooled, Shuichi actually does use Professor Agasa's choker voice changer and Yukiko's disguises to become Subaru. After Conan explains to Jodie and Andre how Shuichi ended up residing in Shinichi's house, Yukiko gives Conan a kiss and leaves to board a flight. Jodie and Andre then learn that James Black knew about Shuichi's plan already, and Shuichi explains to them that he had to reveal it because James noticed the coating on Shuichi's fingers that was used to hide his fingerprints. This was during the time Shuichi tried to stop James from calling Jodie after learning that he had to head toward Raiha Pass to meet Kir. Shuichi did not tell Jodie and Andre anything about his faked death plan because he had to make it real; otherwise, the Black Organization will not be convinced that Shuichi was actually \"dead\". The Black Organization actually did investigate to confirm Shuichi's death by using the disguise of Scar Akai. Shuichi also tells Jodie and Andre that Rei's hatred of him was deeper than he thought, but before Jodie can tell him to elaborate, someone rings the doorbell.\nConan opens the door and is surprised to see Ayumi, Genta, and Mitsuhiko standing outside. Those three kids actually wanted to ask Subaru to solve a mystery for them. As everyone in Shinichi's house tries to solve it, Rei tells Vermouth that Shuichi is actually dead. He happens to know a secret regarding Vermouth and the boss of the Black Organization. He also knows that a secret police agent under the codename Scotch used to infiltrate the organization, but he is now dead.\nAfter Shuichi and Conan solve the mystery for the two FBI agents and the Detective Boys, Shuichi tells the FBI agents that Kir sent a message to him this morning. The message says \"Rum\", which happens to be the codename of the boss's close advisor and is higher in position than Gin is. Shuichi tells them to relay to James that Rum is on the move, while Conan secretly hears their conversation with his earphones.\n- Macademy Awards winner for Best Supporting Actor\n- Master of ceremonies at the Macademy Awards\n- Master of ceremonies at the Macademy Awards\n- Macademy Awards winner for Best Supporting Female Actor\n- PSB agent\n- PSB agent\n- PSB agent\n",
    "Resolution": "- Shuichi Akai faked his death by switching corpses with Rikumichi Kusuda. Conan was the one who came up with the entire faked death plan.\n- Tooru Amuro's real name is Rei Furuya, and he is a Security Police agent working undercover in the Black Organization.\n- The Yusaku Kudo at the Macademy Awards was Yukiko Kudo in disguise.\n- The Subaru Okiya that Rei encountered in Shinichi's house was Yusaku. However, Subaru Okiya was Shuichi Akai in disguise all this time, ever since Akai faked his death. The Subaru disguise was made possible thanks to Yukiko's disguise skills and Professor Agasa's choker voice changer.\n- A secret police agent with the codename Scotch used to infiltrate the Black Organization. However, he was exposed and chose to kill himself, eliminating his personal information in the process. It is implied that Scotch was close to Akai and Rei and that they regret what happened to him. For some reason, Rei seems to blame Shuichi for his murder.\n- A Black Organization member under the codename Rum is on the move. Rum is the boss's close adviser and holds a higher position in the organization than Gin does.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga, Haibara is the one who deduces that the foreign expensive car must belong to Jodie. In the anime, Mitsuhiko is the one who makes this deduction. Also, Haibara doesn't state it out loud while Mitsuhiko does.\n- Conan's flashback from the last time he encountered Amuro was a scene added in the anime and not in the manga.\n- The glove Akai is wearing is a different style. In the manga it has holes over the knuckles and in the anime it is solid.\n- In the manga Akai only handles the gun with his gloved hand. In they add a scene wear he checks to see if a bullet is loaded with his ungloved hand, likely cancelling out the reason he is wearing the glove which would be to avoid leaving fingerprints.\n- In the manga when Vermouth and Bourbon are talking afterwards, Vermouth mentions Bourbon wearing a wiretap while confronting the FBI at the school. This is omitted from the anime.\n- When Jodie asks Akai if he can cook in the anime, he is smiling when he says Yukiko taught him. In the manga he wears a neutral expression.\n- In the manga when Akai suggests letting Jodie and Camel solve the kids' mystery, he is shown with one eye open. In the anime both eyes remain closed.\n- In the manga the back seat of the convertible is never visible until Akai sits up. In the anime, the show the back seat at one point and you can see that there is something there.\n",
