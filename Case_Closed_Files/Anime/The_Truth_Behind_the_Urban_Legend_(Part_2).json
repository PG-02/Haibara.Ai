    "Situation": "A person who murders people with a hammer, dubbed \"Hammer Man\", has been seen escaping to an apartment after assaulting a woman.\n\n\nSato and Takagi stalk out the apartment and are later accompanied by Conan, Ran and Sonoko. They explained that the owner of the apartment were out of the country, but his parents revealed that a male friend of his is borrowing the place, but the parents don't know that friend's name. The neighbors has told the police that the man lived there for a while with his girlfriend. But it seemed that she has left him, and the man stays indoor all day and only comes out at night. A home delivery courier, a bike delivery woman, and a pizza deliverer were seen to leave that apartment and were then interrogated. The three reveal they did not meet their client and instead followed notes specified for them. The courier was instructed to leave the package outside the door, the woman was told to pick up the package, and the pizza man was told to leave the pizza on the table and take the money from an envelope. They then realize that while interrogating the three, no one was watching the apartment. They enter the apartment to find a masked man unconscious. Conan removes the mask and notices that the man was knocked unconscious by a hammer and deduces hammer man has impersonated one of three deliverers from before.\n\nConan investigates the apartment and finds the bathroom to be too clean and that there is no underwear in the dryer.\n",

    "Trivia": "- This is the first episode to be aired on Saturday 6 p.m. JST.\n- Conan's statement, that 'The Hammer man' never existed, is similar to a statement made by his hero Sherlock Holmes in 'The adventure of the noble bachelor'. Holmes who are searching for a missing woman, who had just married Lord St. Simon, tells Lestrade that Lady St. Simon is 'a myth', because he had figured out that the woman was already married to a man she left to meet, and therefor the marriage with Lord St. Simon wasn't legit. Conan says that there never existed a 'Hammer Man', because he had realized that the Hammer 'man' was in reality a woman.\n- The pizza company in the episode named \"Pizza-Ya\" is in fact inspired by Japan's highest grossing pizza-chain named \"Pizza-La but its logo is slightly different from the Pizza-Ya logo. Pizza-La's name is inspired by a pun with Pizza and Godzilla, the eponymous dinosaur that invades Tokyo. It is headquartered in Aoyama, Tokyo. The delivery truck is the same for Pizza-Ya and Pizza-La.\n- This is the fifth hidden case in Metropolitan Police Detective Love Story (series). The fourth hidden case was  A Jewel Thief Caught Red-Handed.\n",
