    "Situation": "Sonoko brought Ran, who brought Conan, to visit the site in the country used as location in filming of a well-received romantic TV series, where the lead actor, who stars as a soldier, tied a red handkerchief to a tree branch to enable his lover to find him. The success of the serial went beyond expectation and the sleep rural area became a popular spot where female visitors tied red handkerchieves all over the woods, spoiling Sonoko's scheme to lure Makoto for a romantic rendezvous. They encountered a man who claimed to be part of the TV serial crew. He explains that he was the one who gave the scriptwriter the idea of the red handkerchief tied to a tree in these mountains, because he had spotted one when he was searching for a place to film. Because of the series' popularity, he had been tasked to answer fan requests. Today he had been commissioned by a fan to find the exact location of the tree with the original red handkerchief, that inspired the show. He asked Ran and Sonoko to leave a message for the fan in a guestbook at an inn, where the fan is staying. He tells them to sign the message 'Hozumi' in katakana. Ran and Sonoko agrees and leaves the message. Shortly afterwards, Hozumi was discovered, stabbed dead, at the spot.\n\nDetective Yamamura shows up leading the investigation. The murder investigation narrowed to three suspects who had arrived recently at the nearby inn, based on that Hozumi had told Ran and Sonoko that the 'fan' he was meeting had checked into the inn in that day. Then they learn from the TV-station that they couldn't find 'Hozumi' on the list of employees who worked on the TV-Show.\nConan realize something and run up to the mountains and digs in the ground only to find a skull. He calls Ran and Sonoko to tell them, that they should go home and make Sonoko reveal the location of the tree where Conan searched for her handkerchief for the suspects to hear. He tells them that he will go home with professor Agasa, so they don't have to worry for him.\nRan, concerned for Conan getting himself into dangerous situations, calls Professor Agasa, who is on his way to pick up Conan, and tricks him into revealing the meeting place.\n",

    "Resolution": "\nWatanuki was a DeSakai yakuza lieutenant who brought henchmen far too numerous for Ran to deal with alone. Makoto arrived in the nick of time and, since his martial skills were superior to Ran's, was able to bring the situation under control. By the time Yamamura and his subordinates arrived, every criminal present had been defeated and rendered unconscious.\nThe buried body belonged to a member of the yakuza, whom Watanuki had been in a feud with for leadership and thus had murdered.\n",
