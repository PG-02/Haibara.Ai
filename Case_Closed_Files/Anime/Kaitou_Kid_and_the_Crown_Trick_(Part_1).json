    "Manga to anime changes": "- The scene when Sonoko is calling Ran in the middle of the crowd is expanded in the anime, with Sonoko struggling among the crowds and Ran apologizing to a woman for suddenly blocking her way.\n- In manga, both Ran and Sonoko are confused when Azusa mentioned about \"that hallway\".

    "Trivia": "- Starting this episode, Rei Furuya is now voiced by Takeshi Kusao, replacing Toru Furuya after the scandal in 2024 that led him to step down as the character's voice actor.\n- The Suzuki Building at Kinza is located in Kinza, but not at Kinza Crossing, since all four famous buildings of the crossing were already shown in Kaitou Kid's Teleportation Magic. Instead, it is also modeled after a real 60-storey building in Ikebukuro, Toshima.\n- The ketchup bottle brand is a local brand by café Poirot, modeled after Heinz Tomato Ketchup.\n- The first smoke bomb Kid uses in this chapter is a different one from the usual ones detonated, as they are usually round, but this one was from a canister. The second however, which was thrown in the elevator, was indeed round. Also, Kid uses a super-strong string to retrieve the crown. This is also the introduction in Detective Conan of the Turbo Engine Skates, which previously appeared in Volume 2 of Magic Kaito.\n- The suspects' names come from \"seas\"[1]:\nSeria Andou (安堂 芹亜) comes from the Adriatic Sea (アドリア海 ,Adoria-kai?) ;\nChikayo Chuujou (中條 近与) comes from the Mediterranean Sea (地中海 ,Chichū-kai?) ;\nBunji Karino (狩野 文嗣) comes from the Caribbean Sea (カリブ海 ,Karibu-kai?).\n- Seria Andou (安堂 芹亜) comes from the Adriatic Sea (アドリア海 ,Adoria-kai?) ;\n- Chikayo Chuujou (中條 近与) comes from the Mediterranean Sea (地中海 ,Chichū-kai?) ;\n- Bunji Karino (狩野 文嗣) comes from the Caribbean Sea (カリブ海 ,Karibu-kai?).\n- Seria Andou (安堂 芹亜) comes from the Adriatic Sea (アドリア海 ,Adoria-kai?) ;\n- Chikayo Chuujou (中條 近与) comes from the Mediterranean Sea (地中海 ,Chichū-kai?) ;\n- Bunji Karino (狩野 文嗣) comes from the Caribbean Sea (カリブ海 ,Karibu-kai?).\n",
