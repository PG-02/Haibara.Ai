    "Situation": "Deciding to go bowling after they are rained out for tennis, Ran, Sonoko, Masumi and Conan are met by Makoto, who engages Sera in a fight after mistaking her for a boy interested in Sonoko. After this is straightened out, we learn that he was attacked by teacher Masahiro Tanba, who was drunk. His coworker Sunami Masaki took him to the car to calm down. Makoto soon leaves to nap in the car, not finding bowling to be his strong suit. After a while, math teacher Michiko Monna becomes worried about Tanba, and in going to check on him, finds him missing. They all check around the local bars, but the missing teacher is found drowned in a portable toilet, and Makoto becomes the prime suspect due to the strength required for such a feat. He also had the opportunity, remaining in the parking lot during the estimated time of death.\n\n",

    "Resolution": "Sunami's motive was to avenge her best friend's, who was Michiko's younger sister, death. Her best friend's goodbye text wasn't about eloping, but of double suicide by drowning as her parents opposed their marriage, and Tanba let her die alone and ran way instead of trying to stop her. Sunami discovered the truth when the drunk Tanba confessed that he was too scared to commit suicide with his lover and had since been blaming himself for his own cowardice. With a mixed feeling of anger and sympathy, she decided to murder him the same way her best friend had died, and send him to the next world to be with her.\n- Deceased (suicide - drowning)\n- Michiko's younger sister\n- Masahiro's lover\n",
