    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan are invited to attend the opening ceremony of a ropeway which is built through a giant Goddess' statue on the Fuji mountains, Shizuoka Prefecture, by a certain Eizo Domoto's company. On the way there, they learn from Shizuka Kamiyama, a nun in a local temple and a very vocal opponent to the ropeway project, that everyone angering or disrespecting the goddess through the centuries has paid an enormous price, and that Eizo's company will not be an exception. Her words are not taken with complete seriousness, but during the ride through the ropeway right after the opening ceremony, Domoto disappears from the ropeway cart, and is later found dead on the goddess' hand.\n\n",

    "Resolution": "\nKnowing that Conan possesses definitive evidence, Ayaka admits to murdering Eizo. She then reveals that her motive is to avenge her mother and older brother. A year ago, her older brother Takahata, who was a construction worker hired by Eizo's company, died in an accident. Although Eizo was not directly involved or responsible, he did order the workers to complete the ropeway in an unreasonably short amount of time, and tried to cover up the accident by using money to make their mother stay silent. Takahata's death took an enormous toll on the old woman, and she soon passed away. While in her deathbed, she summoned Ayaka to tell her about the truth about Takahata's death and her hatred for Eizo's company, and right at this moment, Ayaka's fate of revenge is sealed.\n- Deceased\n- Ayaka's older brother\n- Construction worker\n- Deceased (illness)\n- Raised son\n- Ayaka's mother\n- Divorced\n- Raised daughter\n- Ayaka's father\n",
