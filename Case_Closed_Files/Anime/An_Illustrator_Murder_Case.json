    "Situation": "Kenjin Hanaoka is a popular painter who seems to have everything that a man could want: his own design firm, best selling books, and untold wealth. But when he decides to eat the forbidden fruit and have an affair with one of his pretty, young illustrators his life starts to come apart at the seams. But rather than face the consequences of his mistakes, Hanaoka tries to cover them up in a brutal and bloody manner. Can Conan see through his ingenious plot and expose Hanaoka for what he really is?\n\n",
    "People": "- 48 years old\n- Painter\n- Victim (beaten)\n- 25 years old\n- Illustrator\n- Hanaoka Design office worker\n- Director caller\n- Hanaoka Design office worker\n- Tokyo MPD forensics officer\n- Chono's bike courrier\n",
    "Resolution": "The trick Hanaoka used after bludgeoning her with a rock crystal ashtray was leaning her body over the balcony of his apartment room. The corpse is tied to a fishing line that is connected to a pulley system using a flower pot as a weight and a nail, which was attached to the apartment door and would become detached when it was opened. He hid evidence of the fishing line by using a contact lens cleaner container as a weight to pull the line down a drain after the pot fell. Hanaoka calls a botanist employee to come over to activate the mechanism and in the midst of the chaos has a one sided conversation, pretending to hear from Chono about her supposed plans to commit suicide.\nAfter explaining the trick and with Hanaoka asserting that he'd never been to the apartment before, Conan reveals another butterfly mark hidden on his big toe's nail by spilling a cup of coffee and scalding his foot, making him remove his sock. At the start of the episode, Chono had painted said butterfly mark with a newly released nail polish right before Hanaoka woke up (he did not notice it as Chono had put his socks on). The reason Conan was able to figure that there was a butterfly mark on his toe was because bed sheets was stained with some of the nail polish.\n",
