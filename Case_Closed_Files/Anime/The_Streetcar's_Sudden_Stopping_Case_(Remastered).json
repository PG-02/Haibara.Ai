    "Situation": "Conan and the Detective Boys wake up at 5:30 am in the morning to go get in line for a roller coaster ride in Beika Land. There are only three other people on the train at that time, and they plan on going there in order to take pictures of the train. One of the photographers waits outside so he can take pictures of the train coming towards him. Suddenly, the ladder underneath him tips over and he falls onto the track.\n\nThe train conductor quickly applies the emergency brakes, and everybody rushes out of the train to find him unhurt. However, when Conan comes back into the train to continue their journey, they find one of the other photographers dead.\n\n",
    "People": "- 22 years old\n- Hanayama University 4th year student\n- Photographer\n- Streetcar driver\n- 20 years old\n- Hanayama University 2nd year student\n- Photographer\n- Victim (bludgeoned)\n- 22 years old\n- Hanayama University 4th year student\n- Photographer\n- 28 years old\n- Detective from Harii Station Police\n",
    "Resolution": "She tampered with the ladder Kawasaki was using to take the head on picture of the train to create an accident that would disguise her bludgeoning murder. The ladder was set up beforehand with a hook attached to piano wire spanning over the tracks. This was so that the ladder would tip when the train arrived and cause the accident. Because there had been another train on the tracks earlier at 5:40, the wire had to be set up after that. Additionally, it also meant that the killer knew that Kawasaki would be taking photos there at that time. When the accident occurred and everyone else was distracted, she took the opportunity to kill Horii by bashing his head with the trunk the group was carrying. When the brake was applied, the Horii's body slid forward, hitting his head on the corner. The proof is the injuries to her wrist and palm. She likely received those injuries when she picked up the camera case, so her blood should still be on it.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Kenji Wakai is modeled after Inspector Gadget.\n"
