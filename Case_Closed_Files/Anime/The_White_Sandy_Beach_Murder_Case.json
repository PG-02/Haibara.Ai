    "Situation": "A young and beautiful woman named Mitsuko Sekine is found by a reef drowned in what appears to be a suicide. When information that the town's doctor had been intimate with her in the past is revealed, and Mitsuko's best friend Tomoko insists it was murder, both Conan and Kogoro suspect she is right and that suicide is impossible. Now the two must find the clues before his drinking alibi fully comes through, but what to do when Tanaka was actually drinking with Kogoro himself?\n\n",
    "People": "- Shirahama hospital doctor\n- Mitsuko's ex-fiance\n- Mitsuko's best friend\n- Victim (drowned)\n- 24 years old\n- Tanaka's fiancee\n- Shirahama Police officer\n- Koizumi Shop owner\n- Amamiya bar owner\n- Bar customer\n- Tanaka's friend\n- Resident near Shirahama sea\n- Retired\n- Shirahama Police detective\n",
    "Resolution": "Tanaka brought a swim ring and hid it, then called Mitsuko for a date. He drugged Mitsuko and took her to the seaside; then he tied a boulder to her bare feet, put the float ring around her and poked a hole in it then left her adrift on the ocean. The waves took the still unconscious Mitsuko into the sea and soon she feel to the bottom of the sea, unable to escape and ultimately drowning. Meanwhile, Tanaka was out drinking with other friends of his (and with Kogoro, Ran, and Conan around as well), and this was his alibi.\nThe biggest mistakes that Tanaka made were:\n- Buying the swim ring in the village. Conan asked around and easily found the person who sold it to Tanaka, who was told by him that he'd give it to a friend's child as a gift; he also showed some photos, with the seller recognizing the ring.\n- Tying Mitsuko's feet in a way that, when photos were compared to Ran doing likewise under orders of Kogoro-via-Conan, was highly suspicious. They were tied up with the string's ends towards her toes, instead of the other way round; that is proof that she had not tied the boulder to her own body, but somebody else had done so.\n",
