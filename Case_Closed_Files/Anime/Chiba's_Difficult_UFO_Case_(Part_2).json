    "Situation": "A girl from Haido Senior High School comes to Kogoro's office to report a sighting of an alien at Haido Park. Conan recalls that this is the same place where the incidents of Natsuko Shibuya happened. He also recalls that if Haibara and Mary look alike, they can be related. That can then mean Haibara and Akai Shuichi are also related. Kogoro, Conan, and Ran get to the school, and they see a big piece of concrete with footsteps on it. Officer Chiba later arrives and tells them there was a murder here and that a man was caught in it. It is said that the man was killed by an alien who came out from an flying UFO and fled just after.\n\n",
    "People": "- 17 years old\n- Haido High School karate player\n- Ran's self-declared karate rival\n- Victim (suffocated)\n- 42 years old\n- Magazine editor\n- 38 years old\n- Magazine contributor\n- Alien fanatic\n- Tokyo MPD traffic department police officer\n- Tokyo MPD traffic department police officer\n- Construction site worker\n- Chiba's apartment building's manager\n",
    "Resolution": "Yusuke Kuchiki murdered Nakatsu because the latter had derided his latest effort in taking an actual UFO picture; the trigger for the murder was that Nakatsu suggested that he could submit even a picture of a fake UFO. Kuchiki used a solar balloon - a black, cylindrical plastic bag which floats if the air inside is warmed sufficiently - as the murder weapon, cutting off Nakatsu's breathing and forcing him into the concrete patch. Following Nakatsu's demise, Kuchiki let the balloon float away into the nearby Haido Park, where it eventually ended up in one of its trees, and then dropped himself onto his own deepened footprints (which would have betrayed his perpetration), erasing them. He merely concocted the \"alien murderer\" story in order to ward suspicion off himself.\nHowever, Kuchiki committed a number of mistakes which eventually lead to his arrest:\n- In order to faciliate his plan, he had practiced the disposal of the murder weapon long beforehand, leading to Hina's purported UFO sighting. The black practice balloon and several book about physics, in which the solar balloon effect was described, were found by Conan in Kuchiki's cupboard during the house search.\n- The fact that Kuchiki had pulled his hood over his head despite the warm day on which he committed the murder, in order to prevent his hair from getting stuck in the hardening concrete.\n- That he did not post his alleged \"alien encounter\" on the Internet, despite him being such an UFO fanatic, because he did not want anyone to search for and find the \"UFO\", which was still stuck somewhere in Haido Park.\n- The fact that, following the attempt at Natsuko Shibuya's life, security cameras were installed in the park, rendering Kuchiki unable to retrieve the balloon without being seen. The traces of Nakatsu's saliva and Kuchiki's fingerprints on the plastic would provide the crucial evidence of his murder act.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga, there's a continuity error between panel 2 and panel 3 of the second page of File 942. In the first panel, Naeko Miike is standing on the left of Yumi, whereas in the next panel, she's standing to her right. This was corrected in the anime.\n- At the beginning of the case, Chiba asks Yumi and Naeko if they saw an alien in the streets of Haido during their last patrol. Startled, they answer that they didn't see any alien. In the anime, when Chiba goes away to ask other people, Yumi says: \"He's so dense!\", referring both to the fact that aliens don't exist, and that he still hasn't recognized his childhood friend in Naeko. This was not in the manga.\n- The scene at the end of episode 847 where Conan recaps every hint in his head was not in the manga.\n- The scene in file 944 where Kogoro watches a Yoko Okino movie where she hunts down aliens was omitted from the anime.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The character design for the alien is the same in The Disappointing and Kind Alien.\n- Detective Chiba's first name is revealed to be \"Kazunobu\".\n- This was the first and only time that Chiba was shown as skinny and attractive to other women.\n- The suspects' names are related to celestial bodies[1]:\n- Hina Wada (和田 陽奈) is the actual name of a fan who won the occasion to appear in the manga during the Lets Talk with Gosho Aoyama Day 2015. Moreover, it is a reference to the sun (太陽, taiyō / 日, hi);\n- Kyōgo Nakatsu (中津 恭吾) comes from the moon (月, tsuki);\n- Yūsuke Kikuchi (朽木 雄輔) comes from the Earth (地球, chikyū).\n",
