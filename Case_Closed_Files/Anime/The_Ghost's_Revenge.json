    "Situation": "Two weeks ago, Kogoro and Conan meet Takayuki Suguro at Beika Central Hospital. He said to his wife, Sayaka, and his secretary, Tateru, that he have six months left to live. He was glad that he took out a life insurance policy Tateru insisted, even though Takayuki was opposed to it.\nHowever, several days later, Takayuki was found dead at his house. It was a murder made to look like a suicide.\n\nLater, Takayuki's best friend, Yoji Kanda, arrived. The day before he got a call from Takayuki, asking him to come. It seems that Takayuki was angry with someone and couldn't forgive them.\nSeveral days later, someone spread a rumor that Takayuki's ghost has appeared. Kogoro and Conan and wondered who did that. Later, they hear some police car passing through detective agency. Later, they arrive at the scene, where they see Sayaka and Tateru. Masato Oshikawa, the suspect in Takayuki's murder, is found dead in his house.\n\nThe police conclude that his death is a suicide, which is done in the same way as Takayuki's murder. Sayaka and Tateru admits that they are the ones who spread the ghost rumor. Because they lacked evidence, they spread the rumor to frighten Masato. Conan then notices a suspicious man, saying that it was his fault, before goes away from the scene. The man is Fukusuke Omori, a restaurant owner. He is the one who told Masato about the rumor, but Masato didn't seem to be concerned. That means he is not the culprit.\nKogoro decides to question Tokuko Hanai, the former housekeeper of Suguro household. Tokuko tells them about the relationship between Sayaka and Tateru that she first saw two years ago, which is the main reason she stopped working. Kogoro then asks Yoji about the insurance policy. The insurance has a special accident clause, which states that if the policyholder is killed or dies in an accident, the beneficiary receives double teh payouyt. Kogoro deduces that both Sayaka and Tateru kill Takayuki to get the insurance money.\nConan is not convinced with Kogoro deduction. Later, he spots a clause which states that the money can't be collected in the event of suicide within three years after signing the contract. Conan finally knows what actually happened.\n",
