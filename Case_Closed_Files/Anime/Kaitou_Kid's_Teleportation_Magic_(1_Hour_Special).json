    "Situation": "Jirokichi Suzuki decides to bait Kaitou Kid with the Purple Nail, a pair of high-heeled footwear with embedded jewels worth a fortune, in an attempt to capture him.\nHe places the Purple Nail in the middle of a compact town square to prevent the Kaitou Kid from escaping with his hang glider. After announcing his challenge to the media, Kaitou Kid arrives from the sky and lands on the pedestal holding the Purple Nail. Jirokichi activates his trap and raises four twenty meter tall nets to prevent Kid from escaping the square. Kid grabs onto the Purple Nail and announces he will escape by the use of teleportation; After he disappears in a cloud of smoke, Kid appears atop the roof of a building ten seconds later. He announces to the journalists that one of the Purple Nail on the pedestal was a fake, and that he will return the next night for the second legitimate heel. The next day, Kid attempts to steal the Purple Nail in the same fashion as before. In addition, Kid challenged Conan, saying he would use the same trick, violating Thurston's magic principles. Conan naively remarked that this time Kid would teleport to one of the helicopters.\n",

    "Resolution": "",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- The anime shows various supporting characters watching the second day of Kid's heist on television, including Professor Agasa and the Detective Boys, Subaru Okiya, Eri Kisaki, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police. Most notably, Heiji Hattori and Kazuha Toyama are also watching the event from Osaka, when Heiji suddenly receives a call from Inspector Otaki about a murder case involving a centipede.\n- The anime omits various details from the appearance of Kaitou Kid's accomplice. In the manga version, these details clearly illustrate that the accomplice is meant to be Jii.\n- The anime also omits the Nichiuri logo from the LED display.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is the first episode to be aired on Monday 7 p.m. JST.\n- The buildings featured in Ginza Plaza are in fact real buildings in the Ginza district which if effectively rented just as Jirokichi Suzuki said, would cost millions of dollars. The buildings are: Wako Store, Mitsukoshi Building, and San'ai Building.\n"
