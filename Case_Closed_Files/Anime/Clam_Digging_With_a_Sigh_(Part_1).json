    "Situation": "Conan, Haibara, Professor Agasa, and the Detective Boys are at the beach digging up clams. They encounter a college group of students on similar excursion. Later, one of the college boys is found dead from poisoning.\n\nInspector Jugo Yokomizo is called in on the scene to investigate.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (poison)\n- 21 years old\n- College student\n- 20 years old\n- College student\n- 21 years old\n- College student\n- 21 years old\n- College student\n",
    "Resolution": "The culprit is Shoko Hisazu. She poisoned Ushigome by swapping the bottle cap with the poisoned one that she prepared ahead of time while using a potato chip bag as a cover.\nShe murdered him because she didn't want Ushigome to turn himself in due to the accident that he caused as it would have damaged her and her friends' reputation. Back then when they were driving they felt as if they had hit something, but when they got out of the car and searched they apparently found nothing or no one. So they assumed it was possibly a animal or something, however Shoko had found a man in the bushes but said nothing believing he was already dead.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The suspects' rental car is a brilliant white pearl Nissan Elgrand [E51] with the license plate of 10-64.\n- Although Jugo Yokomizo did meet the Mitsuhiko, Genta, and Ayumi in The Fishing Tournament Tragedy, it was a filler. In this canon case, all four of them are acting like this case is their very first encounter and Conan also tells them this inspector is Sango Yokomizo's younger twin brother.\n- Jugo Yokomizo's vehicle is a 2004 Millennium Silver Metallic Toyota Corolla [E120].\n",
