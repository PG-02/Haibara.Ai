    "Situation": "Seiji Ishimoto, president of an electronic company, claims he has been receiving threat letters and hires Kogoro as a bodyguard. As a House of Representatives member gets on stage at the banquet where they're at, he is shot and Seiji's shoulder is grazed.\n\nConan spots a man on the balcony, but he is unable to find him. Kogoro spends the night at Seiji's hotel room keeping watch in case the murderer returns. In the morning, Kogoro receives a phonecall from Inspector Megure announcing the man on the balcony was found dead.\n\nSeiji tells the police about the threat letters after he's approached by the victim's secretary, Tsuneaki Niikura. When everyone leaves the hotel room, Conan does a search, but he is interrupted by an unknown man who finds something. Inspector Megure questions Kogoro about Seiji's secretary and reveals she has a motive and shows a picture of her boyfriend who Kogoro recognizes as the person he bumped into as he left the hotel room.\n",

    "Evidence": "- The spotlight that had been shining on Masao Takada had been specially made to follow the miniature microphone he was wearing at the time.\n- The photo of the suspect (Shiro Hiraoka) that Conan had intentionally taken before the murder took place, was also found dead in an abandoned building.\n- In the same abandoned building, Conan found the murder weapon hidden under a broken piece of concrete.\n- The gun had been rigged with a motor and fishing line, so that with a push of a button the gun would fire automatically.\n- The remote for the mechanism was found in Seiji Ishimoto's room in a closet hidden under some towels.\n- Tsuneaki Niikura blurted out where the remote had been hidden even though no one else knew except Conan and Kenichi Shibata.\n- Earlier before the murder took place, Niikura dropped the remote causing the battery to fall out he put the battery back in leaving behind his fingerprints.\n",
    "Motive": "Kogoro calls everyone to the murder scene where he declares the boyfriend Kenichi Shibata to be the killer. Conan stuns Kogoro to reveal Tsuneaki Niikura as the true killer who sent the threat letters to Seiji as a diversion. He set things up with his accomplice Shiro Hiraoka, who he murdered later after meeting him in a abandoned building.\nHe had tried to find the gun rigged with the motor but failed to do so, instead he tried to pin the murder on Seiji Ishimoto by hiding the remote in his room. He attached the gun with the motor on the spotlight, and at precisely the exact moment when his boss and Seiji Ishimoto crossed paths he pushed the button on the remote firing the gun. Afterwards, Shiro Hiraoka took the murder weapon and went to a abandoned building and waited for Niikura.\n",
