    "Situation": "Kogoro and Conan visit a famous author named Osamu Umezu in order to have his book signed. Later, they spot Osamu's secretary, Touru Mikami, running to Osamu's house. They learn from Mikami that Osamu is not answering his phone calls and he was going to check up on him. They accompany him to Osamu's apartment and find Osamu dead.\n\nEvidence suggests it was suicide, but Conan notices blood on the trash bin and reveals that it was a murder. Osamu's assistant and son are suspects to the murder due to being the only ones with keys to the apartment, however the third student did hand a key over, unlike the assistant, so that there may have been four keys, although only three were on the desk. Although he son may have copied a key since he never visits, except to ask for money from his father, and did admit that he was going to break in later. By the way, his father was throwing him out, and stated that he never wanted to see him again, so it is highly unlikely that his father would have given him a key. He said that he took it, but he probably just swiped it, and made a quick impression for a duplicate key. So the only ones with real keys to the apartment were his student and assistant.\n",
