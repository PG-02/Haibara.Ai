While investigating, they learn that an accident which took place many years ago is linked to the murder.\n\n\nConan continues investigating.

    "Resolution": "\nShe planned to take revenge on all the passengers who were present at that time, the motive being that if someone else had also helped Komai, the previous bus attendant, her father would have probably survived. She first killed Okumura and Funaki, as their bus schedule didn't match with the rest, then attempted to kill the rest of the witnesses along with herself by tampering with the bus brakes.\nAt first she was going to kill Komai as well, as it turns out she was actually the female bus attendant who was being harassed that fateful day, but after seeing her go to her father's grave and apologize she decided not to. Conan told Touko that Okumura was actually not involved in the bus accident seven years ago, as he was at home sick. This is confirmed by the others passengers, meaning that she killed an innocent person.\n\n",
