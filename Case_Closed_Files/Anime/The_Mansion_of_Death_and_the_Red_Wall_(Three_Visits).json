    "Situation": "Kansuke Yamato and Yui Uehara takes Kogoro, Ran, and Conan to a mansion. Uehara reveals that the mansion was owned by a rich man in the past; The man one day decided to search for five talented people and gave the five a room in the mansion until they have reached their dreams. Uehara reveals that six people, Shusaku Akashi, Aoi Kobashi, Naoki Midorikawa, Shoji Yamabuki, Takuto Momose, and Shiro Naoki, referred to each others as colors that sound alike to their names. They were called Aka (赤?, Red), Ao (青?, Blue), Midori (緑?, Green), Yamabuki (山吹?, Golden Yellow), Momoiro (桃色?, Pink), and Shiro (白?, White) respectively. Yamato reveals that the doors in the mansion swung outward and that someone used a pile of boxes filled with books to trap Akashi inside a room. They examine the room to find one wall of the room painted red and in the center of the room a white and black chair placed back to back and nailed into the ground with the white chair facing the red wall.\n\nYamato's rival, Taka'aki Morofushi whose name can be read in Chinese as Komei, arrives and reveals he was the first to find the body as he was delivering flowers to the late Aoi who died from a heart attack in the storage room of the house. Conan reveals that the culprit knew the door would open outwards in the house and the location of the boxes of books which means the culprit is one of the three people who use to live in the mansion.\nYamato tells Komei to take Ran and Conan with him to investigate the four suspects. They learn that Akashi and Aoi were avid chess fan and that Aoi was adored by all her friends. After investigating the four, they believe Naoki is involved in the murder in some way and travel to his apartment to arrest him. Upon arrival, they find that Naoki has been strangled and that the culprit had spray painted the wall in front of Naoki red.\n\nKomei then heads off to investigate the case on his own.\nKomei investigates the crime scene at the mansion and realizes who the culprit is. Before he could text his answer to Yamato, he is knocked unconscious by the culprit.\n\n\nThe building is set ablaze and Komei is saved by Uehara. At the hospital, Conan and Yamato deduced from Komei's incomplete text \"The late Komei\" was a saying which was alluded from the Battle of Wuzhang Plains. The moral of the story is that one can have great influence even after death. They believe that the culprit murdered Akashi to avenge Aoi's death. Conan and Yamato then realize what Akashi's dying message means.\nKomei regains consciousness, together they conclude that they lack the evidence to capture the culprit and thus decide to use the Empty Fort Strategy to lure the culprit out.\n",

    "Trivia": "- This is the last episode of the 2000s.\n- The case draws heavy reference to Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a classic historical romance from China. In the case, Conan and Ran are aware of this reference, with Ran reciting the historical reference for the uninformed viewers. In fact, a lot of details are inspired from them:\nThe nickname of Taka'aki Morofushi is Komei, a war strategist in ancient time.\nThe dying message of Shusaku Akashi is the case of \"The death scare away the living\", a strategy Komei used to scare away the living Zhongda from attacking.\nConan's planning for the culprit to enter Naoki's apartment was inspired from \"The Empty Fort\", though with opposite use. In the original, The Empty Fort was to purposely reveal resources and traps while there was no actual troops protecting the base, meaning to scare the enemy away. In this case, it was to purposely reveal weakness to make the culprit think he can break into the apartment.\n- The nickname of Taka'aki Morofushi is Komei, a war strategist in ancient time.\n- The dying message of Shusaku Akashi is the case of \"The death scare away the living\", a strategy Komei used to scare away the living Zhongda from attacking.\n- Conan's planning for the culprit to enter Naoki's apartment was inspired from \"The Empty Fort\", though with opposite use.

In this case, it was to purposely reveal weakness to make the culprit think he can break into the apartment.\n- The door to the room where Shusaku Akashi was barricaded in and the rolling trolley blocking the door were both undamaged. This would imply that Shusaku Akashi did not mount a serious attempt to escape by trying to break down the door or pick the lock. Normally it would be expected that a desperate starving person who had the energy to break a window to leave a dying message would attempt to escape imprisonment rather than docilely accepting death.\n- Morofushi's car is a salmon pink 1986 Citroën CX GTI Série 2.\n- The police car is a Toyota Crown.\n",
