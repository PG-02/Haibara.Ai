    "Situation": "The Detective Boys are on the streets when Conan mentions to Haibara that he texted Masumi about the identity of the mysterious child and got the reply of \"the little sister from outside the domain\". They encounter a drug dealer and are to solve a code left by the dealer's notebook. This will determine the next drug transaction happening on the day itself.\n\nAt the Osaka Ebisu bridge, Heiji details the three suspects he notices on the bridge: a large build man with white roses, a young woman with a white rose hair clip, and a average build man with bleached hair, a tattoo and white rose pinned to his shirt. During his description of the third man, he sees Kazuha talking with him and is distracted by it.\n",
    "People": "- Drug dealer\n- Has a bouquet of white roses\n- White rose in hair\n- White rose pinned to shirt\n- Osaka Prefecture Police detective\n",
    "Resolution": "Heiji thought that the bleached haired man was the criminal, and when the police comrades came to drag Kazuha away to safety, he became mad and accidently yelled for the policemen to 'get away from my Kazuha'!\n",
