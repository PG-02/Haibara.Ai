    "Situation": "Conan, Haibara, and the Detective Boys discover an abandoned car when they arrive at the vacant lot, though they'd ignore it and continue with their plan to play football as they planned. Later, Conan and Haibara notice a woman speaking something to her recorder when Genta tries to warn her about the ball Mitsuhiko tries to block it but calls her as aunt, which makes the woman angry, but she quickly apologizes afterward with Genta also apologizing to her. Then they have a fun football game together until the lightning strikes, the woman then waves goodbye to the boys while she is waiting for someone.\nThe next day, there is news about a woman who looks exactly as the one the Detective Boys was playing with yesterday is found dead, which shocks the latter as they come to the scene. Takagi says that Tamaki Onda has many injuries but since there was rain, the time when she died is still not identified yet. Furthermore, the examination shows that she wasn’t robbed and there was a strange jewel in her hand. Conan and Haibara wonder if her recorder was there, and the police confirm that it wasn’t.\nWhile at the scene, a man after being noticed by the boys suddenly runs away in his truck, so the boys follow him. When they arrive, surprisingly, Takagi and Chiba arrive at his place as it turns out, the fingerprint in Onda’s glasses matches with the fingerprint of Ryuji Koyabu, who has just finished serving a sentence. Later, Chiba reports about the jewelry Onda was holding before and tells everyone to come to his place to ask the second suspect, Yurina Shirosaki. However, it turns out that at the estimated death time, both of them had their own alibis. Conan suggests investigating the case again and he, along with Haibara and the Detective Boys get to go along with Takagi and Chiba because they spent time with the victim.\nAt Koyabu’s workplace, one Cheetah Delivery employee states that Koyabu got up in the car at 12:35 am and unloaded the package at 1:05 am and never went away to somewhere else, with the latter being 30 minutes later than usual. So the group decides to investigate the place where he was being later than usual. They also receive a report from Chiba about a small accident that happened at 11:30 pm, so they suggest he check the surveillance camera nearby.\nLater, they notice an old woman with her dog carrying a jewel that looks like the one they got from the scene. And after they ask the woman, Conan deduces that Koyabu and Shirosaki must have hidden something that might be involved in Onda's tragic death. Everyone gathers at the scene, and with the footage from the aforementioned accident, the truth is then revealed.\n",
