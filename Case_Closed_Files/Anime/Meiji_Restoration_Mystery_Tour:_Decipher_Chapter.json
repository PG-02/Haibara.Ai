    "Situation": "The Detective Boys are at a shrine dedicated to Yoshida Shoin, a famous figure of the Meiji Restoration. While there, they witness two men attempt to wrestle a book from a woman named Kimiko Kobayakawa. After the two men flee, Kobayakawa explains that the two men are after her late grandfather's diary which contains the location of a treasure which could buy a country. Kogoro, Ran, and the Detective Boys decode the diary to find the location of the treasure. The picture depicts a fox staring at a stream full of carp with the message \"Feed the carp to the fox\" beside it. Kobayakawa assumes it means the stream of carp she has at her house and takes them to Tsuwano, Shimane Prefecture. On the way, they meet up with Kimiko's friend, Shigeru Kawaguchi, and her servant, Tsuneo Kikkawa. Once arriving to Tsuwano, Conan realizes what the code means and folds the picture to cover the stream resulting in the message \"Below the top of the hidden Inari\". They search an Inari Shrine and find a map of Hagi with the words, \"Reflect the castle in the eye of the cat, and look under the mouse\". While exploring Hagi, Kimiko, Mitsuhiko, and Haibara are kidnapped by the two men from before.\n\nThe kidnappers call Kobayakawa's phone and demand Conan's group to find the treasure before nightfall. Conan realizes that the map of Hagi has the same shape of a cat. He overlaps the picture of a cat from the diary with the map and realizes the location pinpointed by the picture points them to a temple. Once there, Conan realizes that in the previous riddle, \"mouse\" was referring to the English word mouth. Conan finds the next clue in a stone lantern, and explains that the opening of a lantern is called a fire mouth. The clue contains a ripped page of the diary which tells them they should go to a cave infested with Kappas to construct a map. Kikkawa directs them to Akiyoshi cave, the only cave containing a lake. Once there, Conan realizes the diary page contains panels of a jumbled map and organizes them accordingly to the cave's kanji. Once organized, the map tells them to find the pair of dragons where a fox rock shall point to a rock of light. Conan asks Kikkawa to direct them to place with two waterfalls. Upon arrival, the group discovers a shadow of a fox cast by rock formations and at the tip of the shadow, they find a rock with a mirror inside. The group pushes the rock which reveals a cave underneath and navigates through it with the help of the constructed map.\n",
