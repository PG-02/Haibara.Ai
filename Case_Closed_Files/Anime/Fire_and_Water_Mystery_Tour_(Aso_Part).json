    "Situation": "In a dark room, a thief is frantically looking through an office for something. When he finds it, he smiles and cuts open a teddy bear.\nThe next day, the Detective Boys go to Kumamoto with Ran and Kogoro for a sightseeing trip. Kumamoto is known as the capital of water for its amazing water sources, but it's also known as the country of fire for its volcanoes. The group arrives at the Aso Volcano museum, where Ran bumps into a boy, named Justin Takamori. Ran calls Justin cute, and Justin calls Ran even cuter and winks at her. He then adds tat she is in second place as his mommy, Jessica Takamori is in first place. Justin then shows the kids his stamp book of all the tourists spots he has already been to so far.\nConan and the rest then go to the Aso Ropeway Station and ride in a carrier to the Nakadake crater. Once they are done, they leave the area and as they are heading to the zoo, Ayumi spots Kumamon, a stuffed bear, and wants to get one as a souvenir. Ran says later and as they leave with Conan, Justin and his mom buy the same stuff bear. After visiting the zoo, the group go to a food court area and eat. As they eat, a man, soon to be revealed as Monkichi Kumada, puts a bag on a bench and leaves. Then a mysterious man walks up with a Kumamon bear and swaps it with the bag. Ayumi sees this and believes that the man has forgotten the bear. So she runs to the man and tries to give it back, blowing the whole investigation that was taking place. The man sees the police and throws the bag at Ayumi, taking the bear as he runs.\nConan chases after the man with the police and witnesses Justin stepping in front of his mom and colliding with the man, causing the bear to fall. The man picks up a bear and runs away as the police chase after him. At the police station, Monkichi Kumada, the creator of the Kumamon bear explains that a robbery had occurred in his office and that an important item was taken away, a flash drive full of important information. He then tells Mouri that the thief phoned him and told him that he will exchange the flash drive with 10 million yen at the park. Then Keiji Kosugi is phoned and is told that the culprit at the park had been caught, but the flash drive have not been found. Conan then realizes that the bears must have been switched when Justin and the man collided with each other and deduces that they can find Justin at places where he can get stamps and figures out where he would not be and where his next location would be.\nNamie Kajiyama, and the group then heads to Aso Shrine, not able to find Justin, but learns where his next location may be. According to the tour guide at the shrine, Justin said \"I want to go and see the big pig falling asleep.\" Namie believes that Justin may be going to the Aso Milk Farm, but Conan deduces that he will not be there. He looks at Justin's route and says that he is actually going up and that by going to the farm he will be making a U-Turn. Also if he were to go to the farm, Justin will not arrive there in time as the farm closes at 4 P.M and that it is now 3:40. Conan deduces that Justin is at Daikanbo, as he did not say \"the big pig\", but actually \"the big Buddha\". The English word Buddha rhymes with the word in Japanese for pig (豚 buta), while the actual word in Japanese for Buddha is hotoke/futsu (仏). Namie trusts Conan and heads over there with him. When they arrive they witness the thief trying to take the bear away from Jessica. When Justin sees this he runs over and bites the criminal. Mouri and the rest try to intervene, but the thief kidnaps Justin and drove away.\n\nAs the police with the Detective Boys, Ran and Mouri chase the criminal, they received a call that says that if they continue the boy will be killed. Thus prompting the police to stop and Conan to wonder \"How did the criminal know Justin had the flash drive and where to find him?\" and if someone is working with the thief. If so, who?\n",
    "People": "- Victim (kidnapped)\n- 7 years old\n- Tourist\n- 30 years old\n- Justin's mother\n- 26 years old\n- Kumamoto prefectural police department detective\n- 41 years old\n- Kumamoto prefectural police department detective\n- 28 years old\n- Kumamoto prefectural police department detective\n- Kumamon Foods company president\n- 32 years old\n- Kumamon Foods company employee\n- Aso Shrine employee\n- Ramen shop worker\n- Justin's father\n- Higo Foods employee\n",
    "Resolution": "\nHe was threatened and even stabbed by them even if he was a policeman. The boss of Kumamon foods thought he was the one who injured Ayumi and stole the data but it was in fact Inoue. Conan deduced it was him because on the day Kumamon Foods was broken into, Kouda was in the hospital to treat his injuries after his life was threatened by the debtors. The data was hidden inside a USB drive hidden in the Kumamon plush that the mysterious robber had.\nTo explain the truth, Conan tranquilizes Kogoro in his samurai outfit before Inoue can take the plushie from Ayumi. Inoue was the mastermind of the entire case. Inoue is stunned and asks for more evidence. First, Conan had mentioned that he talked about a failed transfer, but he supposedly wasn't even there. He also mysteriously knew that Ayumi was hit with the bag, although he tries to blame Kumada claiming he told him but he couldn't have because he didn't even notice that the name of the injured girl that was Ayumi and not Haibara.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Ran's left ear is gone in some scenes.\n- Keiji Kosugi's van is a 2002 black Nissan Elgrand.\n- Jun Kouda's car is a 2005 gray Nissan Fuga [Y50].\n- Namie Kajiyama's car that was stolen by criminals is a pastel blue metallic 2004 Suzuki Swift [ZC11S].\n- In part 2, on the scene in which the bag is placed by the police who are waiting on the culprit, there is a layering error on the bushes, making it appear as though people are standing on it.\n",
