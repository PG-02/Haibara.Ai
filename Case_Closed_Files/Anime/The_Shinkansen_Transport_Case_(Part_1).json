    "Situation": "While travelling home on the Shinkansen from Osaka, Conan, Ran, and Kogoro ran into officers Sato and Takagi, who were transporting a criminal. Later, a bomb was found on the train which Officer Sato went to investigate. At that time, while she was in the bathroom with it, Officer Takagi had to take the criminal to the bathroom. And then, he apparently committed suicide but...\n\n",
    "People": "- Victim (stabbed)\n- Drug dealer\n- 47 years old\n- Passenger\n- 51 years old\n- Passenger\n- 29 years old\n- Passenger\n",
    "Resolution": "- First, the culprit lured Ogura to the toilet by passing near his seat along with other passengers. He then showed the victim the sport newspaper he had been holding, pointed to \"WC\" to signal the victim to \"go to the toilet\". Because a fake bomb with Analog Alarm Clock was planted in the back toilet, the victim was able to easily make a connection, and thus went with Takagi to the toilet in the front. Since Akashi is the only one in possession of such item, he is the only one capable of committing the crime.\n- Next, the culprit waited until Ogura tricked Takagi into thinking that he is trying to commit suicide with a fake knife and blood pack, which were prepared in advance, to make the latter panic and leave the toilet. This opportunity allowed him to kill the victim himself, essentially turning the fake suicide into a \"real\" one.\n- Akashi was able to somehow describe the crime scene and how Ogura \"committed suicide\" precisely, including the detail that he was handcuffed to the rail in the toilet room, triggering Conan that he must'd known more than he should for a person claiming himself to be unrelated to the crime.\n- As Ogura's blood was not found on his clothing, he deduces that Akashi must had tricked the victim into checking the paper as he stabbed the knife through it and him in order to avoid the blood splatters, evidenced by the ink from the newspaper that got on the victim's hand.\n- The newspaper currently in Akashi's possession has a headline about Ray Curtis being interrogated by the police, despite that Ray himself had turned himself in and admitted the murder, as in the newspaper in Kogoro's possession. Akashi bought two sport newspapers in order to use one of them in the above trick and the second one for a safety measure in the case he was interrogated, not knowing about the difference in headlines. Because the second newspaper was bought at the train station, which is confirmed by the other two suspects, the headline should be the latter, meaning that this copy was used in the murder.\n- Since Akashi is unable to produce the second newspaper, Sato concludes that he must'd torn it apart and flushed it down the toilet. If the police find the paper's remains with Ogura's blood then it would be the decisive evidence against him.\nAkashi tries to escape, but is apprehended by Takagi.\n",
    "Error": "At the beginning of the episode, Conan is talking to Ran through his Earring Cellphone posing as Shinichi however, he is doing it without using his Voice-Changing Bowtie so he should have Conan's voice and not Shinichi's one.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- The manga version started with Ran informing Shinichi about Ray Curtis. The anime version adds some new scenes on how the call started, along with some Kogoro and Kazuha moments, which is not in the manga.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The Shinkansen model in this episode is Tōkaidō Shinkansen JR Central 700 series 16-car sets.\n- The newspaper Kogoro reads at the beginning of the episode contains an image of Ray Curtis, a reference to the previous episode, \"The 3 \"K\"s of Osaka Case\". The title also reads \"Okino Yoko Retires?\"\n",
