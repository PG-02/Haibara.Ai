    "Situation": "Conan, Haibara, Professor Agasa, and the Detective Boys are riding on a bus on a public holiday when, at exactly 2 PM, they witness a man shoving another man off the roof of a nearby building. The bus starts before they can get out.\n\nWhen they get back at 2:20, an ambulance has just arrived, having been called by a pedestrian who almost was hit by the falling man. The man on the pavement is identified as Masaaki Ogata, a loan shark. As it takes on average 5-6 minutes for an ambulance in Tokyo to reach the site of an emergency, Conan asks when the call was made, and learns at about 2:10, right after man hit the pavement. 10 minutes is a long time for someone to drop five floors, though.\nIn the office of the loan shark signs of a struggle are found, and traces of someone who has been dragged from the balcons into the office. Also, there is a drivers license issued to Ryouhei Honda, and his glasses are found on the balcony outside of the railing.\nAfter searching, Detective Chiba finds Honda who takes him hostage. He claims to have lost his memory.\n\n",
    "People": "- Victim (fell - injured)\n- 37 years old\n- Moneylender\n- Beika Emergency Department rescue personnel\n- Tokyo Fire Department fire sergeant\n- By-stander\n- Former-robber\n- Birthday: October 3rd\n",
    "Resolution": "In the course of this, Honda fell from the roof onto the balcony, but wasn't yet dead. When he came to, he was amnesiac though, and before the police had arrived  Ogata had tried to clean up all the evidence before attempting to dispose of Honda (most likely to bury him as evidenced by the items in his car). When Ogata went to pick up the glasses (that belonged to Honda) on the veranda to clean up all the evidence, Ogata had slipped and fallen from the balcony when he was surprised by the thunder and lightning at exactly 2:10 PM. As a result Ogata was mistaken to be the victim, when in reality he was the would-be murderer.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The bus at the beginning is the same from The Mysterious Passenger and was traveling to the Beika City Building, the site of the climax of The Time-Bombed Skyscraper.\n- In A Kidnapping Case... So It Seems, The Man Who Called for an Ambulance, Conan and Heiji's Deduction Magic (The Mansion), Yellow Alibi, Deduction Showdown! Shinichi vs. Subaru Okiya, Coffee Aroma with Murderous Intention (Part 2), The Super Narrow Shop Crime Scene, The Darkest Nightmare, and The Rainy Bus Stop the ambulance license plate number is always 新宿 880, み 98-83 (Shinjuku 880, Mi 98-83), but this time there is a mistake with い.\n- Masaaki Ogata car drive is a Black Mercedes-Benz C-Klasse [W204]. The license plate number is 新宿 320, ま 23-06 (Shinjuku 320, Ma 23-06).\n"
