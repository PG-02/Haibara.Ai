    "Situation": "Three game designers arrive at Kogoro's agency to ask for his assistance to look for their game system engineer, Suguru Itakura. He was last heard in a video mail which shows him in a hotel with an Igo, Shogi, and Chess set. One of the game producers believe that a mysterious man may be the cause of Itakura's disappearance; Conan realizes from his description the man is Tequila from the Black Organization. Kogoro decides to call hotels and ask them if anyone rented a Shogi, Chess, and Igo set at once. After learning of Itakura's hotel and room number, they enter the apartment only to find out Itakura had died of a stroke.\n\nThe police's investigation reveals that Itakura's body was tied up before his death; This means someone tied him up to prevent him from being able to take his medicine which would have prevented the stroke. Further investigation reveals that someone other then Kogoro also phoned the hotel asking for a person with a Shogi, Chess, and Igo set; Since the three producers are the only ones who knew Itakura had those three sets and was staying in a hotel, this makes them the prime suspects for murder.\nThe three designers are: Katsumichi Sugai, Igo board game designer; Ryusuke Soma, Shogi board game designer; and Johei Naito, a chess game designer. While the police investigate, Conan attempts to steal a floppy disk containing Itakura's diary so he could investigate the Black Organization but to no avail. A forensic officer reveals that the body is missing a sock impression on the right ankle, this causes Conan to realize who the murderer is.\n",
