    "Situation": "When Ran, Sonoko, Sera, and Conan are walking, they receive a phone call from Ran's father Kogoro, who asks her not to bother cooking dinner for him as he will be gone for the night. Upon Conan's explanations, the most logical explanation for Kogoro's behavior for the last few days is that he is carousing at a nearby beer garden. Ran, of course, gets understandibly upset about her father irresponsibility, but then an old lady named Takae Kiritani interjects, claiming that Kogoro has been visiting her lately and helping out with some minor household chores, free of charge.\nUpon Ran's revelation that she is Kogoro's daughter, Ran and Conan accept Mrs. Kiritani's invitation for dinner, and soon meet the man the old lady believes to be Kogoro Mouri: a young student named Ryohei Onda, who was asked by Mrs. Kiritani's granddaughter, a fellow student, to help her grandmother against a burglar gang. Though even after the burglars were eventually caught, Onda kept visiting her and helping her out with chores and trivial problems. Now caught in the lie, Onda promises to let to of this deception after this visit, but unfortunately, a loud scream alerts everyone to a crime nearby: in a neighboring apartment house, a man was found in a pool of his own blood.\n\nConan asks three people why's the door busted. They answer that the bell on Denkawa's alarm clock wouldn't stop ringing so they came to his door to asked him to shut it down, but he didn't answer so they had no choice but to bust through the door and go inside and found him dead. They answer that all of a sudden, Denkawa started watching television really loud. What's more, he was just zapping through channels the whole time. Suddenly, the apartment landlady tells the three people not to worry because she brought the famous detective, Kogoro Mouri (which is actually Ryohei Onda pretending to be) to solve the case. Later, Sato and Takagi had arrived at the crime scene to investigate. They receive the testimony from three people at the crime scene. Takagi curiously asks Conan that what is he doing at the landlady's house and Ran says that she is an acquaintance of the landlady so Conan came with him. Sato asks Onda of who he is and Onda acts so nervous. The landlady cannot believe that the police doesn't know that the famous detective, Kogoro Mouri is here. Of course Sato knows Kogoro, but until sudden the landlady tells Ran that she's Kogoro's daughter so she wants her to tell the police something. Ran thanks Sato for taking care of Kogoro, while pretending. Sato and Takagi got confused and wondered what exactly is going on.\nAs Ran secretly told Sato and Takagi everything about why Onda is pretending to be Kogoro Mouri, they'll play along to make the landlady not to find out. So back to the investigation, forensics put the estimated time of death between 5 and 7 PM last night. According to the three people's testimonies, Denkawa was alive around 6 PM, the room key was near the body, and he was holding a bloodstained kitchen knife in his right hand. Judging from the situation, it seems that Denkawa slit his own throat after the three people went out between 6 and 7 PM. Conan doesn't thinks it's suicide and he wonders if the grim reaper did this. The key is on the blood but there's no blood on the key. When Conan found the body, he touched the key a little, it was slightly warm. That's probably because someone hid the key in their palms and threw it near the body when those three entered the room to make it look like the room was sealed. One of the three people who broke the door and entered the room did this. One of those three must've thought that after murdering Denkawa, they'd make a perfect alibi. The three people ask that what was the loud tv sound they heard before setting off and they're certain it's coming from Denkawa's room. Sato answers that someone probably recorded the tv sound ahead of time and used the timer to play it. But then they say the first thing they heard was the 6 PM news, and the date, the weekday and the contents were all from yesterday. Denkawa started zapping two or three times later tough. Sato then thinks he used the DVD or the tape recorder. Nowadays, TVs can turn off automatically if you schedule the time for a program you want to watch and using several extra devices you can make it look like it's zapping through channels. Conan doesn't think that's possible because there's only one tv in the room and doesn't look like there's a timer either. One of the fans fell over and it was Hyodo who tripped on it and knocked it over. He wanted to stop the alarm as soon as possible. The room was dark when three people came in. Bannai tripped on the legs of the body and skinned her elbow. Finally, Ishigame pulled on the cord to turn on the light. Though the room's quite tidy, the laundry was left undried, and there are clothespins scattered all over the place. The newspaper leaflets on the futon also took off. What's more, there's only one tv, so why are there two tv remotes? Conan suddenly notice there's a bloodstain on the side of the remote. He moves the curtain to see through the window. What Conan sees is the next door house of the landlady. He is now certain that the killer is one of those three who found the body.\nThree people are being impatient right now because they're waiting for the police to let them go free until they solve the case. The landlady tells the apartment residents to stop complaining. She also grabs Onda and tells the police that the great detective is right here, so she tells them to ask him an opinion. Suddenly, Onda tells the landlady to hold on and accidentally calls her mother. Later, the landlady's cell phone rings. She opens the cell phone and answers by saying hello. No one is answering because it's actually email. Conan asks the landlady to borrow the cell phone for checking the email. The email is from her granddaughter and it says, \"It's been a while, grandma. It's been three months since we last met when I went to Tokyo for my high school reunion. But thanks to my husband's schedule, we'll be back in Tokyo next month. We'll bring our son and look forward to seeing you.\" It seems that her granddaughter was married already which means what Onda said about being the landlady's granddaughter's boyfriend was a lie.\nMeanwhile, the three suspects are wondering if \"Kogoro Mouri\" can solve the case quickly as soon as possible because they are getting tired of waiting. The police tells them to hold on because even if Kogoro can't solve the case yet, they got no intention of letting them go since they're suspects. Now the three suspects got suspicious of why is the police always following Kogoro Mouri's instructions are ignoring him this time round is because they brought the fake Kogoro Mouri. Sato asks Takagi that they should spill the beans but Takagi said they made the promise to Ran. Unfortunately, Ran said never mind the promise because she wants to find out what's Onda's real purpose of being the fake Kogoro Mouri. Onda is acting so nervous and he sweats a lot. Conan used the voice changing bowtie using Onda's voice saying, \"Then as you wish. The great Kogoro Mouri shall reveal the truth behind this case.\" Conan then drags Onda to the kitchen while pulling his arm where they could talk. Conan told Onda that he called the real Kogoro and heard the truth behind the case from him so Onda will have to go along what Conan says with his deduction.\n",
    "People": "- 70 years old\n- Apartment landlady\n- 21 years old\n- University student\n- Disguised as Kogoro Mouri\n- 22 years old\n- Apartment resident\n- 64 years old\n- Apartment resident\n- 28 years old\n- Apartment resident\n- Victim (throat slit)\n- 44 years old\n- Apartment resident\n- Construction worker\n",
    "Resolution": "The channel button was pressed down by a clothes peg, and the tv remote was fixed on top of an electric fan facing downward. As the fan moved and pointed to the tv, it caused the channels to change, making people think it was a person changing the channels. The tv was turned on automatically by its programmed timer. If it was set to the news, it'd be easy to tell that it's a live program.\nAfter two or three minutes of that, the timer on the fan had been set to make it move, it'd sound as if it started changing channels. Another fan was used alongside the rotating one. At the base of the other fan, a tv remote with its power held down with the clothes peg was placed facing towards the tv, and the newspaper flyer was placed in front of it.\nIf the fan's timer was set to start a few minutes after the rotating one, the flyer blows away due to wind from the fan, and since the obstacle blocking the infrared signals of the tv remote disappeared, the tv would turn off. This is how this was set up, making it look like someone had been changing the channels, and turned off the tv due to the complaints. That's how the flyer got on the bed.\nThe first fan kept moving even after the tv was turned off, and the tv remote happened to be of the same brand as the landlady's tv, so when the fan turned to the landlady's house, it caused the tv in her living room to start changing channels too. The time between the three people breaking down the door, turning the light on, and finding Denkawa's body was probably around ten seconds.\nThey decide to find out whether it's possible for someone to stick plasters onto their body without being suspicious in such a small amount of time. Onda now tells Takagi that he will turn around for ten seconds and Takagi will stick plaster onto his hands quickly as possible. Ten seconds later, Takagi said the plaster were stuck on his hand but they are wrinkled as he was rushing.\nIshigame took his time turning on the lights. Even if there was more time, it'd still turn out the same. It would've been dark before the lights came on. From seeing Bannai use her cell phone, she's likely right-handed. It would've been hard for her to use her left hand to neatly stick plasters on her right elbow and finger.\nIshigame's compress is also firmly attached to his right shoulder. Although a compress and plasters could be used the same way, it'd be impossible for someone to remove them and stick them onto their body so quickly. Of course, it'd be perfectly possible for the culprit to just crumple up and hide the item on themselves, but it's likely someone would do that knowing they might have to go through a police body search.\nWhich leaves them with something that's not suspicious even when on a person's body, and is easy to retrieve. The culprit is Junji Hyodo and it's the rubber band he used to tie his hair. With the rubber band, it can hold the remote on the fan. To make it hard to investigate later, he tied his hair back straight away. To complete the trick, when Hyodo entered the room, he had to remove all traces of the trick as fast as he could, and retrieve the items he used.\nTherefore, since he was the one who came into the room first, to turn off the alarm. He used the impact from 'tripping' over the fan to knock the remote away from it. Finally, if he squatted down to stop the alarm clock, he could've taken the clothes pegs off the remotes without looking suspicious, as well as grabbing the rubber band he used to tie his hair. As evidence, there's blood on one of the remotes.\nIn other words, if the blood mark is from when the remote was attached to the fan, the blood splatter from slicing Denkawa's neck should be on his hair tie. Hyodo defeated, confesses to the crime, it started when Denkawa, fed up with Hyodo's phone constantly ringing, broke down his door and went to his room. That's when Denkawa found out that Hyodo had a case full of drugs in his room.\nRevealing that Hyodo was a courier for a drug smuggling syndicate, and Denkawa threatened him to hand over half of what he earned in exchange for not going to the police. Hyodo decided to kill Denkawa, so an hour before the three left for the hot spring, so he got Denkawa drunk and killed him by slicing his neck with a kitchen knife. He then set up the trick, left the room, and locked the door. After making it look like Denkawa was still alive, thanks to the sound of the tv, left to go to the hot spring. Finally, to stop the alarm clock he set up to go off right as they got back from the hot spring, he broke down the door, threw the key next to the body and disposed of the evidence.\nFor the landlady, she didn't find out that Onda's a fake Kogoro Mouri. Ran is still not satisfied and still confronts Onda asking him why is he dressed up as a fake Kogoro Mouri. Conan reveals that the landlady was Onda's primary school teacher. Despite being such a nice person, the landlady didn't help her husband with the apartment until ten years ago, so she must've had some other job before.\nWhen Conan heard the landlady scolding everyone, speaking louder than normal, he thought it might've been a habit that was carried over from when she was a teacher. If she was a primary school teacher, she would have known how to play the piano, which she apparently does. What finally convinced Conan was that when Onda calls the landlady, \"mother\". For primary school students, their teacher's almost like a parent, and some students actually do call them, \"mother\".\nConan was sure that sensation must've come back, causing Onda to blurt out, \"mother\". Onda was probably one of the landlady's granddaughter's high school classmates. After hearing about the landlady's problems at their high school reunion three months ago, he decided to pretend to be Kogoro Mouri. That's why Onda couldn't leave his teacher.\n",
