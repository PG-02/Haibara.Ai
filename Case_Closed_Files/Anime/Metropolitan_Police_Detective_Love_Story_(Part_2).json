The man who owns the bank Keizo Masuo has just arrived is wondering if his wife has already arrived to the police station, but Takagi and Sato say she hasn’t.\nFinding this strange they call his wife Kayo Masuo, however when Takagi talks to her she says she had no idea that she had to come to the police station. Keizo snatches the phone and talks to his wife, during that moment Takagi had accidentally hit the speaker button allowing everyone to hear their conversation.\nSuddenly, Kayo screams shocking everyone, Takagi and Sato drive to her house along with Keizo and Conan who had stowed away. They get to her house, Keizo splits them up he tells the detectives to search upstairs and while he checks downstairs. Conan notices that a window has been cut via a glass cutter, when suddenly Keizo screams they rush to where he is and find Kayo dead in a study next to a exercise bike with a stab wound to her back from a knife. Conan thinks that these two cases are related - did the robbers kill the wife because she recognized one of them? Conan finds that the husband not mentioning his wife's body suspicious despite having the time and ability to notice during the all that time.\n\nConan gives the police small clues and they eventually find out the culprit who killed the wife. They also found out that a robbery took place days ago in Tohto bank, where Keizo is working as the manager.\n\n",
    "People": "- 53 years old\n- Tohto Bank manager, Haido Branch\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- 42 years old\n- Keizo's wife\n- Bank robber\n- Bank robber\n",
    "Resolution": "Cornered, Keizo admits his crime, claiming that he and Kayo had fallen out recently thus he decided to kill her. However, Sato correctly deduces that Keizo's true motive is actually to cover his role as the mastermind behind the robbery at the branch under his management.\n",
    "Motive": "The robbery was actually set up by Keizo as he was under financial trouble due to his wife's lavish lifestyle. The plan would have gone smoothly had it not for Kayo happening to visit the bank on that day. While being taken hostage, Kayo recognized the robbers as her husband's friends and not knowing that he was in fact the inside man, which was the reason why the robbers switched hostages. As a result she found a photo album of her husband’s friends, and circled the faces of the people she recognized during the robbery.\n",
    "Afterwards": "Afterward, as Shiratori is being praised by Chief Matsumoto, Sato says that \"such matters\" were solved by Conan. Shiratori concedes that children notice things they do not. Later Shiratori asks Sato for lunch at an expensive restaurant but is turned down. Once Shiratori leaves Sato invites Takagi to a ramen restaurant, but Takagi is left behind after Megure invites her to join him for a drink. Takagi is moping as the Detective Boys ask about when he's going to take their testimony.\n\n",
