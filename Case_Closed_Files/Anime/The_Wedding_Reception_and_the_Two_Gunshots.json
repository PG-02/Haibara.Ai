    "Situation": "Sonoko must go to a wedding representing her family, and since she doesn't want to go alone, she ropes Conan and Ran into going with her. The groom Masaru is the eldest son and heir of the incredibly rich Hatakeyama family, and he's marrying a young woman named Miho. The wedding takes place in a very nice villa, and though things are going well at first. Until the end of the reception.\n\n\nMegure, Chiba, and Takagi start investigating, and the darker than expected dynamics of the families start coming to the surface. There are three suspects in particular: Miho's brother and only relative Yoshifumi (who is knee-deep in debts and desperately needed to pay them off), Masaru's older sister Rikako (who had always resented him for being the leader of the family despite her being the eldest), and Masaru's cousin Arisa (who was in love with him and very jealous of Miho). In the meantime Conan starts snooping and asking around, getting hold of the info he needs to see which of the three is the killer.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (gunshot)\n- 28 years old\n- Groom\n- Hatakeyama Zaibatsu family head\n- Victim (gunshot)\n- 26 years old\n- Bride\n- 62 years old\n- Masaru's mother\n- 64 years old\n- Masaru's uncle\n- 25 years old\n- Masaru's younger cousin\n- Shiro's daughter\n- 37 years old\n- Masaru's brother-in-law\n- 25 years old\n- Miho's younger brother\n- 34 years old\n- Masaru's older sister\n- Tatsuya's wife\n- Wedding chairman\n",
    "Resolution": "Ito killed his sister first at the hotel, then his brother-in-law at the villa. He had used a bamboo stalk to throw the gun on the hotel's side of the river. The gunshot they heard the second time was actually an air cannon used to scare off sparrows in the rice field. It had been used as his alibi.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The cars where Masaru Hatakeyama is killed by gun are a white 2001 Mazda Bongo Friendee [SG] and a cosmic blue metallic 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander II [CW].\n- The gun is a Norinco Type 54/Model 213 with suppressor.\n"
