    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Miwako Sato reminisces about the bomber case three years ago in which a bomber sent a fax to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police containing the location of a bomb in the form of a riddle. Jinpei Matsuda deduced the bomb's location and realizes that the bomb contains a clue to an even larger bomb and that the clue is only revealed during the last three seconds before detonation; Matsuda sacrifices his life and allowed the police to locate the second bomb. In the present time, the bomber returns and sends a fax to the Police station.\n\n\n\n\nThe Detective Boys, along with Wataru Takagi and Sato, attempt to decrypt the riddle and locate the bomb. The riddle reads: \"I'm a fast pitching, hard-hitting major leaguer. Now the extra innings have begun. The games begin at noon tomorrow and end at 3 PM. Even if you prepare a good stopper, it won't help you. I'll turn it around in the end. If you want to end the game, come find me. When you police bastards climb the bloodstained mound, I'll be waiting in the steel batter's box.\"\nSato begins explaining the details of the previous bombing case to Conan. In the incident three years ago, two bombers blackmailed the police for 1 billion yen using time bombs planted in apartment buildings. The money was paid and the timers were stopped; however, they later received a phone call from one of the bombers who heard a misleading news flash via a radio and thought that the bomb was still on. The police decided to use the opportunity to capture one of the bombers, but an unfortunate accident caused the man's death. His partner, who managed to escape and witnessed his death, believed that the police had aired false information on the news on purpose to lure them into a trap. Enraged, the bomber vowed to take revenge on the police to avenge the death of his accomplice and friend and has finally returned to do so.\n\nAn explosion occurs at Tokyo Tower and a girl becomes stranded in an elevator. Takagi and Conan free her but become trapped in the elevator themselves due to a second explosion. Conan Edogawa finds a bomb in the elevator and begins to disarm it until a message appears revealing that a clue to a second bomb will appear in the last three seconds before detonation.\n\n\n",
    "People": "- Deceased (explosion)\n- Police HQ Mobile Team Explosive Disposal Unit\n- Matsuda and Hagiwara's murderer\n- Deceased (truck accident)\n- Accomplice bomber\n- 4 years old\n- Akemi's mother\n- NTS announcer\n- Teitan High School class 2-B professor\n- Tokyo MPD Police officer\n- Police HQ Mobile Team Explosive Disposal Unit\n",
    "Resolution": "The content from the riddle indicates the bombing will occur in a school. Conan manages to decipher the code and disarms the bomb with one second remaining and reveals that the code refers to the English word \"Detective\" and when read backwards in its kanji form says Teitan, the name of the school. The bomb at Teitan High is disarmed and the bomber is captured.\nWhen the bomber tries to set it off, Megure appears behind him with dozens of officers holding the cellphone that was to be the detonator revealing that they had secretly disarmed all of his bombs. Cornered he attempts to escape by jumping off the bridge onto a passing car below, however a visibly emotional and angry Sato chases him and corners him, attempting to take revenge for killing Matsuda.\n\nTakagi comes just in time to prevent Sato from doing so and brings her back to her senses. Sato says that she just wants to forget all the pain and the memories she shared with Matsuda, but Takagi says she cannot because if she does he will truly be dead. As they attempt to kiss, Megure interrupts them and the case ends with the bomber being arrested.\nIn the incident seven years ago, he only committed the crime with his colleague to steal money and had actually promised in secret to not kill any victims. However, after his colleague heard an old news report on the radio, he tried to get in touch with the police, believing that the bomb had not been stopped. The police took advantage of his call to track him down, leading to his death when he attempted to escape.\nThe other bomber believed the police had purposefully made that false announcement to take advantage of his accomplice's moral conscience that inadvertently caused him to die in a car accident. The other bomber vowed total vengeance against the Japanese police department and with these new serial bombing attacks threatened to ruin their reputation, slowly losing his sanity in the process.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga version, not much is known about the bombing case that happened 7 years ago. Kenji Hagiwara also doesn't receive any specific character design like he does in the anime version, as he is only mentioned by name.\n- In the manga, Sato recalled Matsuda when she saw the date on her phone while checking the crime scene of the previous case with the Detective Boys. In the anime, she recalls Matsuda when she see Haido Shopping Mall ferris wheel, while the Detective Boys are riding on it. After they finish riding, they see Sato and approach her.\n- In the manga, the bombing happened on November 7 according to Matsuda's message. The anime change the date to January 6, the same as the airdate of the episode.\n- However, there was an error (presumably in TV broadcast version) in the scene when Sato want to delete the message, where the date displayed is November 7. The date was later fixed.\n- In the manga, Takagi doesn't slap Sato to calm her down when she tries to shoot the bomber.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Gosho Aoyama, in an interview, indicated this was one of his favorite case.\n- The bomber's car is a white 1992 Toyota Corolla Van DX [E100]. His watch brand is SEKO, an allusion to the famous brand SEIKO.\n- Ran's cellphone was stepped on and broken by one of her kidnappers in The Smash of Determination and Love, but Shinichi gives her a new one in the beginning.\n- The picture on Ran's new cellphone is the picture of her sleeping that Conan took of her in The Truth Behind Valentine's case, and sent it to her with his own cell phone, using Shinichi's voice. He also called himself \"Detective Kid\" in her message, and that picture does retain the words \"Detective Kid\" from the prior case.\n- Although Conan had been shown knowing how do disarm some bombs, this is the first canon proof that he knows how to disarm some of them, and he is at least a step ahead of those directing him on how to disarm it, as well.\n- The delivery truck which killed the culprit's accomplice is \"Haido Unsou\"'s from The Coffee Shop Truck's Wild Entrance Case.\n- The bus at the ending is the same from The Mysterious Passenger.\n",
    "Rerun": "The episode was rerun on October 4, 2004. It was unchanged except for the addition of a new scene at the beginning.\n"
