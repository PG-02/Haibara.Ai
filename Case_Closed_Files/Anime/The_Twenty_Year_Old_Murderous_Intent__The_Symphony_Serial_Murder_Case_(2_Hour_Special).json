    "Situation": "A man known as the Organizer of the Shadows is shot to death by his three subordinates. Twenty years later, Conan helps Ran and Kogoro solve a puzzle for which the prize is an all-expense-paid trip on a giant boat built for a small number of people. After eleven people have entered the boat, the boat sets sail. Kogoro meets an inspector that he used to work with on the boat and finds that Heij is on the boat as well. After a passenger is murdered, they learn that a man named Saizou Kanou, the Organizer of the Shadows, is on the boat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "People": "- 62 years old\n- Former superintendent of the Homicide Department\n- Victim (burned)\n- 45 years old\n- Passenger\n- Victim (gunshot)\n- 46 years old\n- Passenger\n- 42 years old\n- Passenger\n- Victim (gunshot-injured)\n- 50 years old\n- Passenger\n- 27 years old\n- Passenger\n- Deceased (gunshot)\n- Aka Gray Planner\n- Robbers' leader\n- Oceanographer\n- Deceased (gunshot)\n- 21 years old (20 years ago)\n- Toji's only daughter\n- Bank employee\n- Symphony crewmember\n- Special broadcast presenter\n- Symphony cruise organizer\n",
    "Resolution": "The murderer/culprit is Sadao Kujirai. He entered the ship as an old man to create an illusion that Kanou, the Organizer of the Shadows, was on board. He then proceeded with his plans and invited Teruyoshi Kameda to the maintenance room where he was killed. He hid the body in a box at the rear of the ship. He then came back to the group and arranged a meeting with Korehisa Kanie, who he drugged. He took Kanie's watch and clothes and placed them on Kameda to make it appear that Kanie was the burned corpse.\nHeiji had inadvertently found Kanie's body, and Kujirai tried to kill him as a result Heiji was thrown overboard.\nDuring the commotion with the ship's flag burning and the box with the corpse exploding, Kujirai placed Kanie's body at the front of the ship. After watching everyone's movements and setting up what appeared to be a gunshot at the back, he proceeded to kill Kanie in the front. He then acted as though he was being targeted and told the detectives he'd tell them everything he knew. They were about to begin the interrogation when Kanie allegedly attacked them. It appeared as though Kujirai had been shot in the arm, though that was also a set up by Kujirai who had shot himself earlier when he killed Kanie. He placed a tennis ball under his arm right away to clog the artery so the wound would appear more authentic, slowing the blood flow and making the wound appear more recent than it actually was. Kujirai acted like Kanie was behind everything and that his death was a suicide. After he, Kanie, and Kameda murdered Saizo Kano, his motive for killing his accomplices was to usurp all the money the robbers stole and to spite the dead Kano, who had humiliated Kujirai and viewed him as an idiot.\nSamezaki reveals that Kujirai failed because committing murders right after the statute of limitations for the robbery expired makes him now liable for arrest for murder in addition to the original robbery.\nKujirai asked why most of the passagers are people connected to the robbery. Samezaki reveals that the alias used in the paper was in fact the name Saizo Kano, if it, written in kanji, was turned around. Samezaki then said that Kujirai never had a chance to win over Saizo Kano, since he had been fooled for twenty years.\nIt was noted that Kujirai was from Kansai, revealing why Heiji was called. Also noted is Kujirai's use of cigarettes in order to accomplish the set-ups, such as the burning flag and other scenarios.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is the first episode of the 2000s.\n- Ran imitates a scene from Titanic including by saying the famous line \"I am king of the world\".\n- Although this episode is traditionally animated, the ending scene with Heiji and Conan is digitally animated.\n- The names of the suspects are related to marine animals: Samezaki (鮫崎) shark peninsula, Kameda (亀田) turtle field, Kanie (蟹江) crab river, Ebina (海老名) shrimp name or famous shrimp, Kujira (鯨井) whale well, and Isogai (磯貝) beach shells.\n- The names of some suspects are also related to the sea: Toji has the character for island (島), Nagisa (渚) means beach, and Yoshimi has the character for sea (海).\n- In this case, Heiji stated that he never takes money to do his job, so he planned to return the money to the client who hired him.\n- Heiji's father always fought Toji Samezaki in kendo matches, and is his friend.\n- The statute of limitations for murder in Japan is a mere fifteen years, however apparently the statute of limitations for robbery is twenty years, and the property laws state that if someone is in possession of anything for twenty years, and it is made public (like for example a bank robbery and stolen money in many newspapers and all over the news, where the robbers were never caught, and whose identities are for the most part unknown), and their ownership of said item is uncontested, after the 20th anniversary from the time of the theft, they can keep said item.\n- The case name is the same of Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 1 in C major.\n",
    "Quotes": "- Nagisa Isogai:\nThe sea hides everything. Painful memories, the uncertain future, and even corpses.  (海は何もかも覆い隠してくれる、辛い思い出、不安な未来、そして屍さえも。)\n- Famous scene - Ran Mouri's speech to Conan on the deck:\nI'm begging you. Don't leave me alone.  (お願いだから、一人にしないで。)\n- Toji Samezaki (to the culprit ):\nYou were never any match for Kano never. After all, for the past 20 years, Kano had you by the coat tails.  (こいつとははなから勝負にならねぇなぁ、なんたっておめえは二十年間、叶に踊らされ続けていたんだからよ。)\n"
