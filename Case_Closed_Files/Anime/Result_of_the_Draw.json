    "Resolution": "As Conan watches into details, he finds the truth. He asks Agasa to come back to the house to him so he can use him to explain the truth to which Agasa happily accepts since he won't need to do exercise with the kids anymore. Using Agasa, Conan explains that there was no way Shibata could have killed Shinzo. Since Shibata was 160 cm and Shinzo was 185 cm which would be a contrasting height difference. First of all, if Shibata would have tried to kill Shinzo who was taller, he would have used a reverse grip. Then, it would be more normal that the blood end up on his pinkie finger and around and not on his thumb. Second, it was weird that Shibata's third button was missing under the sweater and it would have been impossible during the struggle that the button end in the flower pot. If Yuko would have heard Genta screaming, she couldn't have been on the second floor since it didn't have any windows facing the yard so she couldn't have identified which kid shouted. Also the house was locked so the only person who could have killed Shinzo was Yuko Kawai, his wife. It meant that Kawai had been first stabbed by Shibata and that Shinzo stabbed him back which killed him. Badly injured, even a foot injured person could have killed him. The proof was that she had worn the sweater on Shibata and that there were still pieces of yarn on her. In fact, when she returned from the market, Shinzo Kawai had already killed Shibata and was injured. He then laughed and said that he got what he deserved which made her angry that her husband was that senseless so she retrieved the ice pick and stabbed him again which killed him. She then put the sweater back and disguised the scene. She then bursts into tears and surrenders herself.\n",
