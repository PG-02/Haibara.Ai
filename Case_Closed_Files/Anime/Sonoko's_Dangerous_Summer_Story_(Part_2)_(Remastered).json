    "Situation": "Sonoko, Ran, and Conan go to Izu, Shizuoka Prefecture, because of Sonoko's schemes to get a man. At the beach, Sonoko takes a picture of Ran fixing her bathing suit and threatens to send the picture to Shinichi. Sonoko is upset about her lack of love life. However, a college student approaches the girls and asks Sonoko to lunch. He appears to be romantically interested and asks Sonoko to dinner as well. They agree to meet at their lodgings later that day. The college student tells the group a story about a brunette that was murdered a year ago and now haunts the restaurant he wants to dine at. Ran is frighten by the story and forbids Sonoko in using the camera to capture a ghost in it. Sonoko suggest that maybe they could show such a picture to Shinichi and see if he can figure something out, since she is going to show the other picture anyway. The group then finds out that another brunette was murdered in the woods recently in the same manner as the brunette from a year ago.\n\n\nThe group goes to the crime scene and meet Sango Yokomizo who cautions them to stay safe. Sonoko, Ran, and Conan are staying at a cheap inn because Sonoko doesn't want to scare men away by staying at an expensive luxury hotel. In the evening, the three of them wait for the college student to pick them up in his car. Sonoko realizes that she forgot something in her room and goes back up to get it. Here she discovers a suspicious figure searching her bags. The figure attacks her and is about to stab her with a knife when Ran and Conan, worried about the time Sonoko is taking, come to find her.\n\nSonoko is saved and the figure escapes through the window. The stoic, and somewhat unfriendly, high school student Makoto Kyogoku that is working at the inn moves the group to another room. Ran thinks she has seen this person somewhere before but cannot remember where. The college student shows up muddy and wet and Conan suspects him of attacking Sonoko. Sonoko says she bit the attacker's bicep in her struggle and Conan makes the college student take off his shirt. However, the college student does not have a bite mark on his arm. Makoto has a bandaged bicep and falls under suspicion but Sonoko says he wasn't the attacker since the attacker was hairy. The college student, Sonoko, Ran, and Conan decide to have dinner at the inn because the college student says his car broke down. Conan speculates that Sonoko's attacker was looking for the photographs she was taking during the trip, but cannot figure out why. Conan does not think there are any incriminating photos after Sonoko shows them, after taking out the one of Ran. Perhaps the murderer overheard Sonoko talking about the photographs and misunderstood. This case is still full of mysteries and Conan cannot figure out why Sonoko was attacked and why the killer would think that she took a picture, that needs to get rid of.\n\nWhile they walk to the police station, Sonoko says that she does have one picture left, which is the one she wants to show Shinichi. Conan realizes that culprit still thinks that Sonoko has an incriminating picture and has sent the car over the cliff to destroy it along with the luggage. But he's still confused as to why the culprit thinks such a picture exist.\n",
    "People": "- Beika University student\n- Waiter\n- Mysterious person following Sonoko and Ran\n- Shizuoka Police officer\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- Brown-haired woman\n- Deceased (stabbed)\n- Brown-haired woman\n- Restaurant front desk manager\n",
    "Resolution": "\n\nThe motive as to why Michiwaki murdered many brown-haired woman is because he was rejected by his brown-haired girlfriend and Sonoko and the previous victims resembled the woman who rejected him. Another reason why he is targeting Sonoko was that when he was killing his latest victim, a train passed by behind him and he saw the lights from it. He mistook it as a flash from a camera and when he later saw Sonoko with a camera not far from the crime scene, he thought that she took a picture of him with the victim and was going to show it to Shinichi, when she talked about the picture with Ran. This was further strengthened by the fact that Sonoko's other pictures showed couples being intimate. It made him think that Sonoko took a picture in the belief that it was another intimate moment. Sonoko never told Michiwaki what the picture really showed, because Ran always interrupted or stopped her from telling anyone. So he approached the group with the intention to find the picture and destroy it. Conan, Ran and Terabayashi arrived at the scene, but it was almost too late, until Makoto saves Sonoko from being stabbed. He incapacitated Michiwaki easily using his karate moves.\nLater, Makoto is revealed to be the captain of Haido High's karate team, which explains why Ran felt that she had met him before. He was worried for Sonoko, because he had seen Michiwaki flirting with two other girls before her. He explains that he once saw Sonoko during a karate competition that both he and Ran took part in, cheering for Ran in such a spirited way that he felt immediately drawn to her.\n",
