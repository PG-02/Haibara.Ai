    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "As Ran came home, she recieve a message  from Momiji Ooka, asking Shinichi to solve some code from a deceased housekeeper of a wealthy family. Some hours ago, she also asked Heiji to solve the code, promising that he will do whatever she want if he solve the code faster than anyone. They later gather at Haido Chuo Building roof.\nLater they arrive at a pancake shop, where there is a huge line. When Momiji mention about add and subtract, Conan and Heiji solve the code.\nHowever, both of them solved the code simultaneously. They later followed the decoded message and headed to the said location What they found there was, a murder scene.\n\nThe police come and investigate the scene. The victim and the three suspects are brothers, whose mother is the said housekeeper who make the code. They all have burn marks on their palm, as a result of saving their mother from a jingisukan pot 30 years ago.\nMomiji and Hattori finds out that on the harbor, there will be a yearly lovely spot for great social media posts. Heiji plans to confess to Kazuha, while Momiji plans to stop him.\nThe three brothers mention that the first brother was giving away a watch with leather band and a leather jacket. However, when the other brothers give him some canned crabs, chocolate, and nuts, they were returned back. Conan then realized who is the culprit.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (fell)\n- 42 years old\n- Department store buyer\n- Housekeeper's eldest son\n- 39 years old\n- Bank employee\n- Housekeeper's second son\n- 38 years old\n- Bike store employee\n- Housekeeper's third son\n- 36 years old\n- Unemployed\n- Housekeeper's fourth son\n- Servant of the Ooka family\n- Haido Port worker\n- Deceased\n- Former housekeeper\n- Likes mysteries\n- Deceased\n- Housekeeper's husband\n",
    "Resolution": "Heiji also deduces that he is not the real Saisuke Jinya, since he was wrong about how the brothers had saved their mother from jingisukan pot. He thought that they had grabbed the pot that was falling onto their mother, while in reality is they caught their mother's head that was falling onto the pot. At that time, the mother was fat, so she was heavy, and their hands were pressed onto the jingisukan pot. The burn marks on the fake Saisuke’s hand is made by applying citrus juice and exposing it to the sun.\nHeiji also know that he is fake Saisuke from his unattached earlobes. Since it is a dominant gene, one will get them if one of their parents have them too, but in the photos both the parents have attached earlobes meaning that all four brothers should have attached earlobes.\nThe fake Saisuke admits that he thought the burn marks were cool when he met Saisuke in college. The real Saisuke passed away several days ago due to an illness. Before he died, he mentioned the code and his mother’s treasure to be fake Saisuke. While the fake Saisuke arranged the real Saisuke’s belongings, his phone recieved a message from Benzo. Since he had a similar face and burn marks, he then decided to meet Benzo to get a part of the treasure. However, he was found out by Benzo after he incorrectly guessed how the brothers got their burn marks in the first place. Benzo threatened to call the police and he tried to prevent him from doing so, but in the process pushed him over the railing on the walkway.\nThe treasure is later revealed to be the jingisukan pot Benzo was carrying in a bag. Most likely the mother wanted the brothers to reunite and eat jingisukan together again like thirty years ago.\n- Deceased (illness)\n- 36 years old\n- Housekeeper's real fourth son\n\n",
    "Aftermath": "",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the first scene, Momiji drinks tea with a cup plate on her lap. However, the cup plate was removed in the anime.\n- In the manga, Ran came home and went to the detective agency, with Kogoro sleeping there. She was also in the detective agency when Conan came home. In the anime, she directly goes to her room and is in the living room when Conan comes home.\n- A scene where Iori is looking at his hand clock is shown, which wasn't in the manga.\n- In the manga, the cars used by the group to go to the warehouse are white. While in the anime, they are black.\n- In the last scene of Part 1, Momiji is shown hiding behind Iori's left side. The manga showed her hiding behind his right side.\n- The scene at the beginning where the Detective Boys are at Agasa's house is slightly changed. The videogame they play, which features Yaiba Kurogane and Sayaka Mine in the manga, is changed to two different characters.\n- In the manga, after Conan explains the possibility that the culprit might hide before the other people come, Kazuha and Ran praised him. Conan then pretend that it was from Shinichi, with Hattori swearing in his thought. This scene is removed in the anime.\n- A few dialogues of Heiji, Kazuha, and Ran are cut in the anime.\n- When Momiji asks Takagi to check if the body has a burn mark, he goes to the body to check his palm. In the manga, Takagi was still near the body and directly checks the body's palm.\n- After saying he spilled lemon juice, Conan later corrects that he only spilled water, not lemon juice on the culprit's hand. This dialogue is not in the manga.\n- Kohji Haneda's hand is not shown in the manga. The anime shows his hand but does not show his palm bruise.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The black metallic sedan is 2008 Mercedes-Benz CLS 550 [C219].\n- The names of the suspects come from the theme of Jingisukan pots:\n- Saisuke Jin'ya (陣屋 才輔) comes from the \"Jin\" part in Jingisukan and veggetables (野菜, Yasai in Japanese);\n- Suguru Kashiwagi (柏木 優) comes from the \"Gisu\" part in Jingisukan;\n- Katsunobu Kanda (菅田 克信) comes from the \"Kan\" part in Jingisukan;\n- Benzō Hamana (浜名 勉造) comes from the word pot (鍋, Nabe in Japanese).\n- Episode 1025 (international episode 1082) marks the first time the episodes using international numbering outrank the number of manga chapters published at that time.\n"
