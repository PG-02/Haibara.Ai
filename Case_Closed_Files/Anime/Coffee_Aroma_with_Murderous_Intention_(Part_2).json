    "Situation": "Two TV producers, Shogo Somei and Maiko Kazumi, ask Kogoro to star on his own show. Kogoro agrees and they plan a meeting for the following day. The next day, Somei picks Kogoro, Ran, and Conan up to meet with his manager, Raisaku Nakame, to discuss the show. When they arrive to Nakame's apartment on the twentieth floor, Somei reveals that Nakame had been talking about killing himself lately, prompting the idea Nakame has committed suicide. They call the apartment manager who opens the door and cuts the door chain allowing them access to the room. They find Nakame who had died because of poison in his coffee.\n\nThe police suspect the possibility of murder with the hypothesis that the culprit offered Nakame poisoned coffee before leaving and told Nakame to lock his door with a door chain. Conan investigates the coffee stains and realizes the culprit was with Nakame before he died. This means the culprit somehow placed the door chain back on the door before leaving. The police suspect Somei to be the culprit and that he had tampered the scene to hide how the murder was done.\nConan's investigation reveals that Somei tampered with the evidence to suggest Nakame was alone during his time of death. Conan reveals that there were originally two plates, two cups of coffee, and two pieces of cake. Somei took the piece of cake and placed it with the other piece to make it seem as if they were one piece. He then poured coffee from one of the cups into a plant and pretended the cup was a container for pens. For the other plate, he placed it under the spilled coffee cup to act as a saucer.\n",
