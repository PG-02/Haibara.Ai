    "Situation": "Ran and Conan run into Sachiko, an acquaintance of Ran's, while shopping. She says she is buying steak and wine for dinner with her lover who's visiting. Ran is impressed that Sachiko has someone she wants to cook for. The next day Ran and Conan find that Sachiko is murdered. Kogoro gets permission to take a look, since Sachiko was a friend of Ran.\n\nEveryone suspects Sachiko's lover, who is nowhere to be found. The place has been robbed of money and jewels. But only Sachiko's steak had been eaten and there were no prints besides Sachiko's found on any of the items on the table. Ran can't believe that someone who Sachiko loved would do such a thing remembering how happy Sachiko had seemed the day before. Other odd points comes to light. Why does this lover only visit on 25th every month? Why didn't Sachiko tell her close friend from her school day about him? Why didn't this lover touch his food? All they find out is that the relationship began a year and a half ago, and that Sachiko would be excited when 25th would come around.\nA witness, who Sachiko had brought wine from, claims to have seen the lover leaving her building, recognizing him from a month ago, and agrees to provide a sketch. Just as Ran is about to give up hoping for the lover's innocent, she starts to realize the truth with hints from Conan. She and Conan questions a friend of Sachiko and thereafter an elder lady. Then they go to Takagi, convinced that the lover isn't the killer.\n",
