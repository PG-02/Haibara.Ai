    "Situation": "Conan, Haibara, and the Detective Boys meet Yuriko Matsunaka, an orphaned girl. She is a potential heiress to her maternal great-grandfather's fortune, but she must first solve a riddle. Tokei, the man's secretary, instructs her to seek out the Detective Boys' help, and they all gather at the mansion in Nishitama. At 9:00 pm he announces the riddles: \"When the bull loses its horns, and his tail becomes his head. The angel will come down and play the horn. That melody is my treasure.\" They have exactly 24 hours in which to solve the riddle. Conan solves the first part of the riddle and finds a black stone, but they fall into a trap which leaves them in a labyrinth.\nAccording to Greek mythology, Minotauros was born to a Cretan King, who had offended God. So he inherited the blood of a bull. The Minotauros grew up to be a frightful, brutal beast, so the King of Crete sent his own son into the \"Labyrinth of No Return\". The important thing is that the King would annually send seven Athenian children into the labyrinth as tributes. When the hero Theseus heard of this, he went to challenge the labyrinth, and defeated the Minotauros. He returned from that so-called \"Labyrinth of No Return\", using just a ball of yarn. He tied one end of the yard to the labyrinth's entrance, and let it unwind itself as he walked. To return from the labyrinth, he just followed the yarn back to the entrance.\nConan, Haibara, and the Detective Boys parallel the legend by using the yarn from their clothes to navigate the labyrinth. Eventually they find their way out with three hours left to solve the riddle.\n",
