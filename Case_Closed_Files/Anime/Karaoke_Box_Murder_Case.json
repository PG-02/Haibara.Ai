    "Situation": "When Sonoko's father uses his connections, Ran and Sonoko find themselves in a Karaoke Bar having dinner with the hottest band in the land! It seems like a dream come true until the lead singer, Tatsuya Kimura, is poisoned right in front of their eyes. The brash super-star had plenty of enemies (he constantly fought for nothing with Mari, Mieko had her love confession to him rejected, Katsumi was angry at him because he was about to go solo and that put the band's career on hold, Go was in his previous band till he left and he was very rude towards the whole band), but which of them hated him enough to commit murder? It's up to Conan to find out.\n\n",

    "Resolution": "",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- This episode takes place right after Mountain Villa Bandaged Man Murder Case, with Ran bringing up Sonoko's deduction of the case. Conan is worried as his cover might be blown, only for Sonoko to accept the credit for solving the murder and claiming that Kogoro and Shinichi don't measure up to her (with the manga showing both detectives in the background). The scene as a whole was used at the end of the Mountain Villa Bandaged Murder Case episode.\nIn the anime version, Sonoko brings up Tatsuya when Ran asks if she has a guy in her life, whereas the manga version has Ran asking about Masaru Ohta (from the Mountain Villa Case), only for Sonoko to express disinterest for him as she is interested in Tatsuya.\n- In the anime version, Sonoko brings up Tatsuya when Ran asks if she has a guy in her life, whereas the manga version has Ran asking about Masaru Ohta (from the Mountain Villa Case), only for Sonoko to express disinterest for him as she is interested in Tatsuya.\n- In the manga, Tatsuya was depicted as somewhat drunk up until his death. Immediately before his death, he coughed up blood before collapsing on to the floor.\n- The anime leaves out the main theory of the crime, which is that Tatsuya committed suicide (based originally on the poison being found in the victims car and later supported by other evidence). This is what the police investigation concluded happened and what Inspector Megure was going to release as the cause of death at a press conference before receiving word of Shinichi Kudo's phone call.\n- The manga reveals that Tatsuya was rude to his band because the record company forced him to pursue a solo career, so he didn't want them to miss him after he left.\n- The anime ends with Ran receiving her present, whereas the manga ends with her trying to find Shinichi, while Conan is shown, nervously hiding.\n- In the anime version, Sonoko brings up Tatsuya when Ran asks if she has a guy in her life, whereas the manga version has Ran asking about Masaru Ohta (from the Mountain Villa Case), only for Sonoko to express disinterest for him as she is interested in Tatsuya.\n",

    "Anime": "- The names of the characters in the Funimation Dub are:\n- Mieko Shibazaki - Amber Ling\n- Katsumi Yamada - Sledge\n- Tatsuya Kimura - Justin Moon\n- Mari Terahara - Mazy Mitchel\n- Go Sumii - Georgie\n",
    "Remastered version": "On October 22, 2011, a remastered version of the case was aired.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Despite his face not being shown on-screen, this marks the first time Detective Takagi is listed in the ending credits. He's the inspector that brings the box of Tatsuya's items to Inspector Megure.\n- In Conan Edogawa Kidnapping Case, Conan thought to himself that \"I asked the Inspector not to release my 'real name'\", referring to this case.\n"
