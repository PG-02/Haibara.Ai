    "Situation": "The line to visit the Robanov Emperor Exhibition today is very long because Kaito Kid will appear tonight to target the Queen’s Bang, the crown with the world’s largest ruby ​​and also the centerpiece of the exhibition. Today, Conan is here at the invitation of Jirokichi along with Ran and Sonoko, in addition, they also meet Amuro and Azusa because the air conditioner at Poirot was being replaced so they were allowed to visit the exhibition. Of course, because Amuro has many female fans, Azusa suggests that she go with Ran and Sonoko, and Conan go with Amuro, so that the surrounding female fans of Amuro would have a more favorable view.\nWhile waiting for their turn to visit, everyone suggests that Amuro do some interesting tricks with the playing cards that Sonoko brought along. While everyone is impressed by his magic trick, a strange man suddenly comes and compares it to child play. But unexpectedly, this gets Amuro interested and calls Kazami, who is attending an event involving Yoko Okino, to join in this mission.\nAt the gallery, while discussing the security system used for the treasure, a guard, who is actually Kid in disguise, informs about the message the MPD received from him. At that time, Nakamori orders him to tell everyone to wear gas masks. While waiting, Kazami suddenly becomes unusually eager when Amuro tells him to return when he has learned enough about the security system, so the two of them split up to go around somewhere. After a while, Azusa asks to enter the gallery through Nakamori, because he has been a regular customer of Poirot since the Tanuki safe incident, to meet Kid once.\nAnd then the heist happens under Kid's name as usual. The three people most likely to be Kid in disguise are: Azusa, because she was supposed to go home because she was tired but suddenly wanted to see Kid, Kazami, who was unusually eager earlier, and Amuro.\nConan begins his investigation by asking each person one by one to confirm: He begins with Amuro, asking him about the menu that a person waiting outside mentioned to the group. Amuro, although curious why he is asking him that at the moment, answers that it was Carbonara; As for Azusa, it is the same question, adding the reason for coming to the exhibition; and finally Kazami, but this time Kazami acted more impatient than usual. After asking permission to see the blueprint of the security system from Kazami and Amuro, Conan accidentally sees paint stains on the hands of all three people from Kid's heist, from which he also understands who Kid was disguised as and how he did it.\nWhile Nakamori is trying to call for Kid's pursuit, convinced that he might still be in the building, Amuro receives a call from his superiors asking him to stop participating in this mission. A while later, Ran and Sonoko go to the gallery to find Azusa while the two security policemen have returned, but just when it seems like this is the first time Conan has failed, the he declares that he knows his disguise.\n",

    "Resolution": "Kaitou Kid is disguised as Yuya Kazami.\nFirst, Kid sprayed white paint all over the room from the chimney, then took advantage of the chaos to place a fake box on top of the Queen's Bang box, making it look like Queen's Bang had actually been stolen. The box that Conan opened earlier was actually a fake, so he didn't activate the security system.\n- Before the heist, the middle leg of the chair Conan is sitting on was thicker than the other two legs, but after the heist, it was even with the other two legs,\n- The paint stain on Kazami was located from the palm to his fingers, proving that he had placed something on the box containing Queen's Bang.\n- Amuro and Azusa had proven themselves that they are not Kid through Conan's questions.\nAt this time, Nakamori, Jirokichi, Amuro, and the police surround Kid and it seems like he would not be able to escape. But Kid makes a bold move. He takes the crown, and at the same time, activates the trap while connecting the gun wires one by one to the wall to fly over it. Even Conan could not catch up to him. After getting out, Kid expresses his disappointment to the security police but is suddenly handcuffed by Amuro in a riot police uniform.\nIn fact, after being rescued, Kazami disguised himself as Amuro with the help of Conan's voice changer, while Amuro waited outside to confront Kid as revenge for daring to call his card trick a child play. However, Kid is able to free himself from the handcuffs and returns the Queen's Bang.\nKazami receives a box from Amuro containing a CD, a calendar, a photo book, and a DVD of Yoko Okino's performance the day he joined in the heist, although Kazami would rather hear Yoko sing live.\n",
