    "Situation": "Conan Edogawa tries to figure out the phone number to the boss of the Black Organization. Mouri is invited by a granddaughter of a rich household to solve these mysterious accidents that happen whenever someone tries to play a Stradivarius for her grandfather on his birthday. Four incidents have happened on that day already and it is about to come up again.\n\n\n\nLater a fire occurs and a man is burned to death.\n\nIt is revealed that the house hold are killed off one by one in the order of the C Concert scale. The grandmother of the house was revealed to be emotionally shocked after the death of her son. Every midnight, she would leave her room carrying the Stradivarius like a child. That night, she breaks the violin, and falls out of the window.\n\nIt was revealed the culprit taped up an object to lure her to the window where she would fall to her doom.\nConan figures out the object was the real Stradivarius that lured the grandmother to fall to her death.\n",
    "People": "- 54 years old\n- Shitara family butler\n- 23 years old\n- Choichiro's granddaughter\n- Victim (burned)\n- 60 years old\n- Shitara family's third son\n- Conductor\n- 32 years old\n- Composer with perfect pitch\n- Choichiro's nephew\n- Victim (fell)\n- 68 years old\n- Choichiro's wife\n- 72 years old\n- Shitara family head\n- Deceased (beaten)\n- Kyosuke's father\n- Shitara family's second son\n- Deceased (illness)\n- Danjiro's wife\n- Kyosuke's mother\n- Maiden name: Haga\n- Deceased (fell)\n- Genzaburo's wife\n- Deceased (fell)\n- Hasuki's father\n",
    "Resolution": "He murdered Ayane by switching the real and fake Stradivarius. When Ayane breaks the fake violin, she heard the music Kyosuke played downstairs. Kyosuke has reserved a violin that is hanged on the window using Genzaburo's command stick that is sticked to the window causing Ayane to think it is the real Stradivarius. She merely wants to grab it, but she fails and fell from the window resulting in her death. The evidence can be found as near Ayane's body, there are the bridge from the violin, and a part of the command's stick. It was also revealed that Kyosuke saved Ayane out of the fire because he doesn't want Genzaburo and Ayane die together in the fire.\n",
    "Trivia": "- In the manga, Emi's fall upturned but in the anime, she falls in reverse position.\n- In the manga, Kyosuke only mentioned Aunt Emi dying the way his father did. While in the anime, it's shown she fell down the stairs when she ran out of the room after revealing what happened 30 years ago to Kyosuke.\n- Kogoro's vehicle is an Airstream 2002 Nissan Elgrand.\n- The Opera song played by Kyosuke Haga is said to be Mozart - Requiem in D minor, K. 626, but it is not.\n- Although Megure has called Kogoro the \"God of Death\" multiple times in non-canon, and even once in canon, such as in The Sullied Masked Hero case, this is the first time for him to flat-out call him \"Harbinger of Death\" to Kogoro's face. Even in The Sullied Masked Hero, it was more of a mumble, and not actually talking to Kogoro at the time. In this case, while talking with Kogoro, he actually called him \"Harbinger of Death.\"\n- At the beginning of the case, Conan told Agasa about the area code of Tottori, 0858 may be the first four digits of the Boss's e-mail address, since he heard these 4 digits being dialed in A Course Without Protest, A Code of Stars and Tobacco, and from  Vermouth off-screen in Head-to-Head Match with the Black Organization: A Dual Mystery on a Full Moon Night, and she added the word \"Boss,\" when she hit send.\n",
