    "Situation": "Professor Agasa has once again won a meal ticket and is taking the Detective Boys to a restaurant at the department store. On the way there Conan thinks over what he knows about Masumi and the girl, Mary, who is living with her, but his thoughts are interrupted by Haibara, who is dead tired after chasing after a cockroach all night. When they arrive at the department store, they see it already decorated for Christmas. Ayumi and Haibara approach the makeup counter, and Haibara demands that they get to try on some makeup since they are customers. The counter workers try to deny them since they are too young. Upon Haibara's insistence they get the makeup (Mascara lining) anyway, but Haibara sorely disappoints the counter worker's hopes for a sale to their mothers.\nAfter the meal Agasa reveals another surprise, that he had also won a shopping ticket so that they could buy themselves early Christmas presents. Ayumi, Genta, Mitsuhiko, and Haibara all walk off to select their favorite presents, blissfully ignoring the fact that the ticket is worth only ¥10,000 (roughly $100). Conan and Agasa observe the restaurant chef, Ujiyasu Hosogoe, getting told by another chef that a troublesome customer had called again, and Ujiyasu telling him to inform the customer to meet him in the stairwell.\nAfter half an hour has passed, Conan hears screaming coming from the stairwell and rushes in to find Ujiyasu has been stabbed. He said that the culprit ran down the stairs so Conan has the Detective Boys run to the stairwell and remember every detail about the culprit when they see him running down. The police are able to round up three suspects, but the Detective Boys unexpectedly give three completely different descriptions of who they think is the culprit is, and Genta mentions that he thinks the culprit had the number 2 on him.\n\n",
