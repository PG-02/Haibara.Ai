When a police officer arrives at his house at Hikaridai, he is surprised to find the living room have signs of scuffle, and the money inside the safe had been stolen.

Megure recognizes him from a murder case happened three ago, where Temukai, who worked at a government office, was one of the suspects. At that time, to prove his innocence, he confessed that he had been secretly meeting a certain businessman. However, his government office learned about the meeting, and he was fired. Currently, he operates a publishing company, where he try to get close to successful people and make them write autobiographies. Yamakabe is one of those people, and it seems he was avoiding Temukai.\nThe police later come to Temukai's apartment. Temukai says that he was working alone at the time of the murder. Megure then mentions that Temukai had detroyed his own car in a one-car accident on the morning after the murder. However, Temukai keep insisting that he didn't kill Yamakabe. Despite the lack of evidence, Megure is willing to risk his career before the chief section, and proceed to arrest Temukai. However, the next morning, after the news reported the arrest, Yasuko Chikaba comes to the police station and confesses that she had a meeting with Temukai at her house in Tenma from the evening until around 9:00 p.m. That is the moment when Megure knows that he has fallen into Temukai's plan.
