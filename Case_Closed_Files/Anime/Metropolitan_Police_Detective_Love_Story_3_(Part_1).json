They witness him set fire to a seemingly abandoned warehouse, and are ambushed by him who tries to kill them.\n\nTakagi is revealed to be inside the warehouse the arsonist set fire to. He decides to use his gun to break the handcuffs, but realizes that he can't due to them being a memento from Sato's dead father. Conan and Haibara manage to arrive in time and stop the arsonist, but does not realize Takagi is in the burning warehouse.\nMeanwhile, the clock strikes midnight and the suspected bank robber, Shuji Kano, explains everything to Sato, explaining how her father died saving his life after he tried to kill himself. Sato reveals that due to the typhoon delaying his flight back from Italy, the statute of limitations expiry date was moved back by one day. When Sato asks Kano where Takagi is, he tells her he placed him in a abandoned warehouse which Sato realizes is the same one that is currently burning down in flames.\nSato arrives at the fire, but Megure and Shiatori say it’s too late but Sato tries to run it but to her horror it collapses. Takagi seemingly dies but appears with his handcuffs attached to the window bars. He collapses in Sato's arms exhausted, Sato wonders why Takagi didn’t break the handcuffs with his gun. Conan and Haibara explain that he did so because he knew how much those particular handcuffs meant to her, leaving Sato touched by his kindness.\n",
