    "Situation": "Conan, Masumi, Sonoko, and Ran go buy swimsuits in an upscale department store. The girls spend a while trying on many two-pieces, which causes Conan to remember something from the past.\nAs goes out for a stroll to clear his mind. Conan witnesses the extremely bitchy behavior of a rich woman named Ritsuko Sashihara. She belittles and abuses another client (Tomoyo), the shop assistant in charge (Reia) and her assistant Ayami. Few later, Ritsuko is found strangled to death and bleeding in the dressing room. Conan and Masumi check on the corpse and realize that she left some dying clues, and Conan recalls more and more of the old incident that he's been thinking about through the shopping trip.\n\nWith the help of Sonoko mentioning the face cover used in cosmetics, Sera and Conan solved the trick the culprit used to murder the victim unnoticed.\n",
    "People": "- 43 years old\n- Customer\n- 24 years old\n- Shimusa Clothing Shop employee\n- Victim (strangled)\n- 41 years old\n- Customer\n- Cosmetic company president\n- 35 years old\n- Customer\n- Ritsuko's subordinate\n- Shimusa Clothing Shop clerk\n- Shimusa Clothing Shop clerk\n",
    "Resolution": "Conan thinks about how Masumi didn't know the difference between how Americans and Japanese count and how Europeans count, and connects it to other instances of Masumi saying and doing things that someone who lived in America wouldn't—being surprised at how thin a baseball bat was, and keeping her fork in her left hand while eating during the Red Woman case, and referring to soccer as \"football\" during the Romance Novelist case. Conan realizes that these instances show that Masumi actually lived in the United Kingdom, not in the United States, in Britain, cricket is more popular than baseball and has a wider bat, when eating, one would not switch the fork to the right hand, as is the case in the United States, and the British refer to association football as \"Football\", while in the U.S. it's called \"Soccer\".\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- Because the three manga chapters were not enough to make two episodes, some scenes were either made longer, or dialogues were added.\n- During her interrogation scene, Ayami is asked about the gifts in her purse. She tells the police that the boxes contain perfume and are a gift for the store manager. In the manga, Takagi requests to see the contents of her perfumes boxes. In the anime, however, Ayami herself offers to show him.\n",
    "Trivia": "- In The Fist of Blue Sapphire, the white swimsuit worn by Ran in the pool is one of those she bought here.\n- The name of the suspects come from type of clothes[1]:\n- Ritsuko Sashihara (指原 律子) comes from separate clothes (セパレーツ ,separētsu?);\n- Tomoyo Nitsuka (二塚 朝世) comes from knit clothes (ニット ,nitto?);\n- Reia Nanbu (南部 玲亜) comes from flares (フレア ,furea?), bell-bottom clothes;\n- Ayami Yamaki (八巻 彩実) comes from camisoles (キャミソール ,kyamisōru?).\n- The store name SIMUSA (シムサ ,Shimusa?) comes from Musashi (武蔵 / ムサシ ,Musashi?).[1]\n",
