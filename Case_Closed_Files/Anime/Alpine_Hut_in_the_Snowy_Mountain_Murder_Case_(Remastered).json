    "Resolution": "The evidence was in the room that shows Kaori is the murderer it was on the table. The blood has been suddenly cut off, and it was revealed that it was one the tablecloth, Kogoro told them to place the tablecloth on the table so that the blood stains match. To prove that he left behind a dying message, he recalls that Oyama died on his knees then said it now became quite obvious that their names have the same kanji as the pieces in shogi, and it was found out that Oyama always said that if he had a horse then he'd have it all.\nHe then said that their names represent every piece, except for the knight, then told Ran to get the lighter that's on the sofa and put it on the tablecloth, where the bloodstains on the lighter and tablecloth match, then it shows that it was the rook. In other words, this dying message points to the person with the same kanji as the rook- Kaori Nakahara, then he reveals that she is the one who knocked the tablecloth off, then he reveals that the blood on the table suddenly stops, there's no blood on the sofa that the lighter was on. This proves that it was moved after the blood had completely dried. In other words, the murderer returned to to the scene of the crime and found the dying message. She saw the message after she had screamed so she hastily tried to hide it by removing the tablecloth causing the lighter to land on the couch.\n- Deceased (illness)\n- Kaori's father\n- Kaori's mother\nKaori confesses that she respected Oyama as a father, that's why she couldn't forgive him for stealing her thesis, Ginji reveals that it was about \"The Development of Genetic Treatment for Intestinal Cancer\". She then reveals that the thesis Oyama stole, it was the thesis that she put all her passion into for the past six years. The reason she wrote the thesis was for her father, who passed away because of intestinal cancer when she was young. The reason she became a doctor is so that she could devote herself to that research so that no other people would go through what her father did.\n",
