    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Kogoro's car runs out of gas while he is driving in the mountains with Ran and Conan. Fortunately, a man called Michiyoshi Majima passes by, and kindly picks them up and invites them to his mansion. Majima turns out to be the director of a furniture company, and he owns an enormous mansion in rural Shizuoka. The mansion has a beautiful stone garden with an artificial waterfall. Three times every day, the water is allowed to flow into the empty sandy pool right next to the waterfall (then, in half an hour, the pool will be automatically drained), and the resulting sight is exceptionally pleasant. Majima proudly shows the three visitors this garden, and mentions that it was constructed under the order of Director Kiyama, the former head of the company. He died in a car accident, one year ago.\nAfter this visit, the three visitors are ushered by the housekeeper Ayaka Honjo into the mansion. There, they meet Masayuki Hashimoto, the private secretary of Majima, Nobuaki Endo, the director of Kiyama Interior, and Tomonori Kiyama, a freelance writer of a travelling magazine and Director Kiyama's son. They are there to attend a ceremony, and after spending an afternoon and a dinner with them, it becomes clear that some of them hold grudges against Majima. So, it is hardly a surprise when Majima turns up dead the next morning in the middle of the (empty) sandy pool of the rock garden.\n\nInspector Yokomizo arrives on the scene and begins an investigation. Kogoro accuses Hashimoto of committing the murder, as Kogoro knows that he owed Majima a lot of money and Majima threatened to fire him. After being proven wrong, Kogoro then floats the idea that Honjo committed the murder. He wants her to confess, but she swears that she did not kill anyone, and that the only thing that she has been hiding is that she is the daughter of Director Kiyama's driver, who died with the Director in the car accident. She says that after hearing rumors that Majima was behind the murder, she decided to work at his company in order to determine the truth. She further reveals that Endo knew all along who she is, and that, during the previous night (at around 10:40), he threatened to reveal her identity to Majima.\n\nThis disclosure, along with the fact that the police found a threatening note that Endo wrote to Majima, makes Kogoro and Yokomizo turn their attention to Endo. They head to the roof of the mansion to investigate, as, in the note, Endo wrote that he would expose Majima unless he would head to the roof at 11 PM the previous night (Endo planned to kill Majima there, but, as we will see, he did not succeed). Once there, Kogoro gets inspired again, and this time, he accuses Endo of committing murder. Kogoro says Endo just needed to tie a rope to an arrow and shoot the arrow towards the large tree beside the waterfall with a bow. Then, he would be able to to place the body in the middle of the sandy pool with a pulley and without having to step on the sand.\nKogoro confidently says that in order to destroy the rope afterwards, Endo would tie it to another arrow and shoot the arrow into the nearby forest. Following this line of thought, the police begins a search of the forest, and they actually manage to find a rope tied to an arrow. Conan is shocked by this finding, as he believes that the position that the dead body was in makes it impossible for that trick to have been used. So he begins his own investigation, and soon he is able to determine the truth.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (strangled)\n- 50 years old\n- Kiyama Furniture director\n- 24 years old\n- Housekeeper\n- 37 years old\n- Michiyoshi's private secretary\n- 45 years old\n- Kiyama Interior director\n- 28 years old\n- Freelance writer\n- Deceased (car accident)\n- Kiyama Furniture former president\n- Tomonori's father\n- Deceased (car accident)\n- Mr. Kiyama's driver\n- Ayaka's father\n",
    "Resolution": "Conan then declares Tomonori Kiyama to be the culprit. He conjuectures that during the previous night, after leaving the dining hall at around eight, Kiyama did not return to his room but went to the main wing of the mansion to kill Majima. Since everyone else was still in the dining hall, he did not have to worry about being seen during and after the murder (i.e. when he was in the rock garden). He did have to make sure to not be seen during the return to his room, though, and this was complicated by the fact that Honjo would be working at the \"reception\" near the mansion entrance after dinner. However, Kiyama knew that Endo planned to talk to Honjo in private in order to threaten her (Endo's real intention was to just distract Honjo, so that she would not notice Kiyama going up to the roof before 11 pm), so he just waited outside until Endo and Honjo started talking, around 10:40 pm.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is the last episode to be traditionally animated. Starting with the next episode, all episodes will be digitally animated.\n- The garden reappears in a poster from The Fishing Tournament Tragedy.\n- The trick Kogoro thinks Endo used to put Majima's body in the middle of the garden is actually used in Magic Lover's Murder Case.\n",
