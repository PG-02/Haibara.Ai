    "Situation": "Conan and the Detective Boys are visiting a group of university students who are members of the figure club. However, one of the students, Kazuya Shiraishi, is not happy with their visit, because they have a project that needs to be finished tomorrow. While Kazuya is working alone in the room, an explosion was heard and a blackout occurs. Conan tries to approach the room, but Naoto Mizuhara prevents him from going. A second explosion then occurs, and smoke is seen from the room. The door is locked, and Keiji Aoki asks Conan to call the fire department.\n\nUnfortunately, Kazuya inhales a lot of smoke and passes away. The police later come to investigate the scene.\n",

    "Resolution": "However, Saki and Keiji then admit that the fire near the garbage bin is because they threw away a bunch of tissues which was used to wipe some ethanol they accidentally spilled, and tell the police that the whole case was just an accident. Conan however, realizes what really happened and calls Agasa.\nMizuhara’s motive was that he had found out that Kazuya had stolen Yuri's designs. Yuri was another figure club member who committed suicide last year. She admired Kazuya, but Kazuya has decided to take advantage of her pure feelings and betrayed her.\nLater, Conan through Agasa explains that the locking mechanism did not work as planned according to the position of where the bottle filled with thinner fell. Knowing that the plan would fail, Keiji Aoki and Saki Midoriyama prevented Kazuya from escaping from the second explosion.\nBoth Keiji and Saki had overheard Mizuhara's argument with Kazuya over him stealing Yuri's designs. Before that, both Keiji and Saki had already criticized Yuri for copying Shiraishi's design, which they believe might had lead to Yuri committing suicide. As both Keiji and Saki after finding out the truth, realized that when they had inadvertently criticized Yuri, she had put two and two together and realized that Kazuya (her hero) had stolen her designs. In turn this caused her to become depressed and she eventually committed suicide.\n",
