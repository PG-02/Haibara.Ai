    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan are all heading into Chinatown to have a nice dinner. In the car, Ran is studying extensively for an exam, and hasn't slept very well. Her mind keeps thinking back to a blurry memory of her and Shinichi, and she keeps thinking about that mysterious man, Shuichi Akai, and about how she believes she has seen him before. Conan is very worried for her health. While at the restaurant, they share a dinner table with another group of guests, because Kogoro didn't read the fine print on a coupon. One of the guests on the table dies.\n\nInspector Jugo Yokomizo arrives on the scene. Kogoro mistakes him for his older brother, Sango, which angers Jugo, who is not a fan of Kogoro. Because Ran sat near the victim, she is considered a suspect! Conan wants to figure out who the murderer is, not just because Ran is a suspect, but also because she keeps looking more and more ill. Could something bad happen to Ran?\nAfter an investigation, which sometimes is tense, Conan finally figures out how the killer could have killed the victim. However, when everyone was about to leave, Ran collapses on the ground, and the officers offers to drive her to the hospital.\n",
