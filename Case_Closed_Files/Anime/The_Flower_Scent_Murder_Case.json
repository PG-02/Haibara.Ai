    "Situation": "A threat on a flower show artist causes Kogoro Mouri to be hired during a local flower show, but when one of the guests is murdered.\n\nConan must find a way to prevent yet another possible murder from happening during the same show.\n",
    "People": "- 33 years old\n- Rika Okano's manager\n- 28 years old\n- Avant-garde Ikebana artist\n- Victim (strangled)\n- 58 years old\n- Bay Front Hotel owner\n- 35 years old\n- Pro wrestler\n- Football player\n- Actress\n- Soccer player\n- Hotel clerk\n- Hotel bellboy\n",
    "Resolution": "- Conan smelled the scent of chloroform's from the victim's flower.\n- Searching Rika's belongings, Conan found a bottle of chloroform which was used in the murder. First the culprit put the victim to sleep before murdering him. He also found a bottle of potassium cyanide, concluding that the culprit is planning to murder someone else as well.\nConan soon figured out that the second target is none other than Rika Okano. As the flowers that all the guests received should have already bloomed meaning the flowers on the stage are the ones that were poisoned. As Midori Ozaki, Rika's manager was the one who prepared the flowers for the guests and the stage only she could have done this.\n- A frozen ball of chloroform is put in a flower that had it’s temperature reduced so it would revert back to a flower bud. When time passed, the flower would bloom releasing the chloroform in vapor form and the victim will fall sleep within a few minutes.\n- A frozen ball of Potassium Cyanide was employed in a similar tactic, except that this time it was put in the flowers that were on the stage used in the show and this time, to kill the targets directly.\n\nIt turns out that Rika's secret ikebana techniques to make flowers bloom onstage weren't hers to start with: the real creator was Midori's older sister Haruka, a fellow ikebana expert. Years before the murders, Rika and Shiraki stole Haruka's secrets and blacklisted her from the ikebana circles. They had payed off any of the Ikebana circle sponsors that she had attempted to perform for causing her to lose her credibility.\n\nMidori searched for info on who stole her sister's trademarks and soon found out about Rika, who claimed she was the true creator of her sister’s Ikebana techniques. So she became Rika's manager and staged a gambit to kill both her and Shiraki. She first used the flower blooming technique to knock Shiraki unconscious and then strangled him with his own necktie, then she rigged Rika's stage flowers with poison and got ready for the performance. Had her gambit worked, both Rika and Midori would have been fatally poisoned: Rika would've been \"punished/executed\" for indirectly causing Haruka's death, and Midori would've escaped punishment and been \"reunited\" with her sister in death.\n- Deceased (suicide - poison)\n- Ikebana artist\n- Midori's older sister\n",
