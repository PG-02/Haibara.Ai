    "Situation": "Vermouth is on the phone with Gin. Vermouth passes on the information that Bourbon came across, that Sherry was hiding in Gunma and was going to travel on the Bell Tree Express, a train owned by the Suzuki family which hosts a special mystery onboard. Vermouth recalls her encounter with Conan Edogawa and her promise to let Sherry go. She justifies the upcoming attack on Sherry as Bourbon's job and asks Gin not to interfere before the train reaches its destination.\nConan, Ran, Sonoko, Professor Agasa, and the Detective Boys including Haibara prepare to board the Bell Tree Express. Haibara still has a cold and has on her cold mask on the platform. The Detective Boys learn that the train usually runs only once a year, but this year will be different because Jirokichi Suzuki plans to run it a month later in another attempt to lure out Kaitou Kid. Sonoko also plans to leave her love letter for Kid in the train car. Suddenly Masumi Sera shows up, and she says she is interested in the deduction quiz that will take place in the train. Haibara notices her and covers herself with her jacket's hood.\nNext, more passengers arrive. Satoru Ando of Room 8C is the first to arrive, and he is traveling with a client's painting with a solid gold frame. Taisaku Noto (8A) and Mari Idenami (8E) show their familiarity with the conductor. Natsue Komino (8D), an old lady in a wheelchair, is accompanied by her maid Hiruka Sumitomo. And lastly, the angry Etsuto Murobashi appears (7B), and he accosts the conductor for not having his usual room in Car 8. Kogoro (8B) introduces himself to the group after adjusting his mustache into the style of Hercule Poirot, explaining to him that his daughter, Ran, is a friend of the owner of the train, so he got Murobashi's room.\nIn Agasa's room, 6B, Conan and the Detective Boys are chatting. Someone knocks on their door. They find a mystery card lying there, telling them they have received the role of detective that will investigate the murder which will occur in Room 7B. The group (excluding Agasa) goes to 7B and witnesses a supposed murder incident. A masked man with hood shoots Etsuto Murobashi. They run after the murderer, but he gets away.\nLater, they run into a train conductor, and learn that the quiz is supposed to happen an hour later and the card was fake. Conan, with a shocked expression, runs back to 7B only to found out that Ran, Sonoko, and Masumi are there instead, and to complicate thing further, Ran's group tell them they're in 8B. It seems that after the murder happened, Car 7 disappear into thin air.\nMeanwhile, Haibara, who's slightly behind Conan group, follows them half-heartly, shows a strong reaction when Scar Akai leaves one of the rooms. But Scar Akai, who is dressed in a formal outfit, does not notice her and walks in the opposite direction. Haibara catches a glimpse of him.\nConan tries to convince the train conductor that something was wrong with the mystery murder that took place to no avail. Nevertheless, they learn more about the nature of the train. Passengers can ring a bell which turns on a light above their door to summon the carriage attendant who sits in the hall. Additionally, each car has no indication of its number inside, only from outside can one tell the car number, a feature added by Jirokichi Suzuki to make the train more mysterious. Meanwhile, Haibara recalls her encounter with Scar Akai a moment ago. She thinks he has the \"feeling\" of Dai Moroboshi but doesn't understand why he has a burn mark.\nConan then recalls seeing Masumi holding a card when they first ran into Ran's cabin. They go back to 7B and confront the girls with the correct conclusion: everything happened in 7B all along and the girls had lied that the room was 8B. Ran's party received the role of accomplices (assigned by the card that Masumi held) and temporarily switched rooms with Murobashi as part of the trick. As the Detective Boys followed Conan into the room, Masumi notices that Haibara is with the group, and says she wants to have a word with her. Haibara is spooked, but the conversation is cut short because Scar Akai had been lurking outside the door. Masumi demands to know who was there, but Scar Akai hides himself before Masumi sees him.\nAfter the trick is revealed, they return to Ran's original room, 8B, to inform Murobashi that their trick got exposed. They try to open the door, but it is chained shut and Murobashi is \"sleeping\" on the couch. Just then, Masumi and Conan notice the gunpowder smell and break the chain link to open the door. They found Etsuto Murobashi was killed in a sealed room!\n\nConan and Masumi explain the reason why Murobashi's case could not be a suicide. Conan then receives a message from an unknown sender and tells the Detective Boys to go back to their room with Ran, and shouts angrily when they don't comply. Haibara thinks about the \"ominous feeling\" inside her, as well as Conan's tense behavior, as she clinging to Ran and wonders what is going on. Immediately, Scar Akai walks past and glares at Haibara which frightens her. Tooru Amuro also appears right behind Scar Akai, and greets Ran, who informs him a murder has taken place. This happens in the hallway right outside Subaru Okiya's room. Inside, Subaru hears the conversation and is also accompanied by a woman resembling Vermouth who is seemingly busy with her cellphone, but we don't see her face. He says to her that, \"Heaven is siding with us\".\nJirokichi Suzuki, who waits at Nagoya station, orders the train to head there without stopping, so he can witness the murderer captured. Without any other choice, Kogoro, Conan, and Masumi go to interrogate the passengers. Ran, Sonoko, Agasa, and the Detective Boys return to their room. The Car 8 conductor was the last to see Murobashi alive and gives his recount during the interrogations: The call bell sounded but no light was on so he visited Noto (8A), whose light was burnt out. Noto says he didn't call for service. It was at this time the conductor saw Murobashi on his phone at 8B's door. The conductor was then summoned to 8E, where Idenami complains about a noise in her room. During this time, Komino and Sumitomo (8D) exited their room and headed away, after which the conductor noticed someone peeking at him from behind the opened 8A door. Kogoro, Conan, and Masumi discover the connection between the suspects: They were all at a wealthy person's birthday party five years ago which ended with a big fire that killed the host and most of their family. They also discover the light bulb wasn't fixed as all the spares were missing, along with a set of conductor's uniform. Conan receives another unknown message.\nMitsuhiko brings up the subject of the woman (Shiho Miyano) who saved them from the fire in the last case. It is revealed that Mitsuhuko had sent a video recording of the woman to Kogoro, so Kogoro could find and thank her. Kogoro also thought of uploading the video to the internet. This causes Haibara to panic and think her ominous feeling is due to Black Organization members on the train. Haibara receives a message from an unknown address asking, \"Are you ready?\" and signed \"Vermouth\". Haibara makes an excuse to go out. Ran notices her strange behavior and tries but fails to follow her. Alone, Haibara recalls the tape left by her mother, Elena Miyano, for Shino's 18th birthday: She talks about Haibara's parents starting a drug project that will require them to leave Shiho and Akemi behind, a project they call \"Silver Bullet\". Haibara then regrets making the drug, thinking it was something that shouldn't have been made. She looks at the antidote to APTX 4869 that she is holding and decides to take it so that she can avoid involving those associated with her Haibara persona. Before she can take it, Subaru confronts Haibara, commenting that he accurately predicted her actions from knowing her sister, and invites her to \"enter our area\". Haibara runs away from him instead, thinking she can't be killed while in a shrunken state.\nConan is still investigating the case. He asks the suspects to be filmed while running. They also learn the wealthy person was a collector of famous paintings, most of which were lost in the fire. While Sumitomo is filmed running, Conan tries to talk to Komino, who doesn't respond and smokes a pipe. Masumi leaves the group, intending to take the recordings to the Detective Boys to ask them which looks most like the masked suspect they chased earlier. On the way, Amuro notices her from a room and contacts someone with his cellphone. Scar Akai then walks past the mysterious woman who had come with Subaru. The woman says something to Scar Akai as he passes which startles him. But before he can follow her, Masumi confronts him and asks, \"Who are you?\" Scar Akai smiles and tells Masumi, \"you haven't changed a bit.\" and he reveals his face to her. Masumi, surprised and confused, responds with \"Shu-nii\". (nii is Japanese suffix to call an older brother). She questions Scar Akai, stating that Shuichi should be dead. Masumi and Scar Akai's confrontation ends abruptly when Scar Akai knocks Masumi unconscious with a taser. Scar Akai then comments that Masumi's response was the one he wanted to hear.\nCheck the resolution to see the rest\nCheck the resolution to see the rest\n",

    "Resolution": "",
    "Character background revelations": "- Tooru Amuro is revealed to be the Black Organization member Bourbon, and he seems to know Shiho's mother, Elena, in which he instantly realizes Shiho as \"Hell Angel's daughter\".\n- Scar Akai is revealed to be a disguise used by Bourbon and Vermouth to impersonate Shuichi Akai to ensure that the real Shuichi is dead by judging the reactions of Shuichi's sister and close friends. Bourbon had been using the disguise prior to boarding the train, but he had Vermouth take the role because she can imitate Shuichi's voice and block Masumi Sera from interfering.\n- Masumi Sera is Shuichi Akai's younger sister.\n- Subaru Okiya is an ally of Conan's and his heavily hinted to be the real Shuichi Akai. The man who looks like Shuichi who drops the grenade is wearing Subaru's clothes and had taken Masumi's hat which had been in her room when Subaru returned Masumi.\n",
    "Important event summaries": "- Vermouth reports to Gin that Shiho Miyano has been killed. Although she later realizes she had been tricked, Vermouth keeps this discovery a secret.\n- Yukiko deduces that Vermouth has some vital reason to hide from the rest of the Black Organization that Shiho and Shinichi have deaged due to APTX 4869. She also confirms that Vermouth was involved in trying to force Suguru Itakura to finish a special project he had stopped.\n- Yukiko wins the bet she made with Vermouth, with the stakes being that Vermouth had to give up on hunting Shiho completely.\n- Bourbon, who had earlier concluded Shuichi was truly dead, begins to second-guess his deductions. He asks Vermouth for detailed information from before and after Shuichi's death so he can begin from square one.\n- Conan discovers Tooru Amuro is Bourbon, which Bourbon does not realize.\n- Elena and Atsushi Miyano had worked on a project for the Black Organization called Silver Bullet which ultimately caused them to leave Shiho and Akemi. Shiho realizes that she should have never tried to complete the project. This solves the mystery of what Elena said on the final part of the tape left for Shiho's 18th birthday.\n- Kaitou Kid's heist has been postponed because the Belltree Express where Jirokichi Suzuki's challenge would have been issued is under investigation. Kaitou Kid now considers Conan to be in his debt.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- Several conversations were removed in the anime adaptation.\n- Part of Yukiko and Vermouth's conversation: \"Especially since it seems that the kids have met her in her former appearance...\"\n- Amuro's explanation of why Vermouth was using the Scar Akai disguise on the train: \"She's the only one who can completely immerse herself into the role of that man, and you know her well, after all...\"\n- Gin commenting about how it is good the police and Jirokichi are on the platform: \"It's good for us that the boss of the Suzuki Corporation and the top of the Aichi Prefecture police force are here... They'll misunderstand the whole situation as an attempt on their lives...\"\n- Yukiko cutting off her scream for Ai once Vermouth left her room.\n- The carriage attendants commenting on the black smoke from the explosion: \"Did the storage hold really blow up? Ye... yes sir. There was a bang, and when I looked out the window, there was black smoke.\"\n- Bourbon's retreat to the front of the car and his wondering about the identity of the man he saw: \"Could it be, that silhouette I just saw...\"\n- Vermouth noting that Conan had been eavesdropping: \"He'd been listening to our conversation!\"\n- Part of Conan's conversation with Kaitou Kid: \"You came to scout out the train before your heist.\"\n- Part of Conan's conversation with Kaitou Kid: \"But I'm short, so I could see her chin and saw through it all straight away.\"\n- Part of Conan's conversation with Kaitou Kid: \"They'll probably try and corner her in the storage hold, where they've set some explosives, so be careful...\"\n- Part of Conan's conversation with Kaitou Kid: \"The reason you chose the wheelchair bound...yes, the real old lady and her maid...\"\n",
    "Trivia": "- In episode 704, there is a single frame coloring error in the scene where Vermouth speaks to Yukiko. The black in Vermouth's eyes and eyebrows is omitted.\n- This case marks the first time Kaitou Kid has had a personal brush with the Black Organization, assuming the Magic Kaito Organization and the Black Organization are not the same.\n- This case was adapted into an animanga that was released on February 16, 2018.\n- The train is being pulled by the preserved SNCF steam locomotive 230-G-353, which appeared in the 1974 film 'Murder on the Orient Express'.\n- Frequently missed clue as to Bourbon's identity is when Amuro opened the door, after the smoke, he saw that there was NO Fire, yet, he told everyone, \"Fire.\"\n- The names of the suspects come from characters in Agatha Christie's \"Murder on the Orient Express\"[1] :\nSatoru Ando (安東 諭) comes from Count Rudolph Andrenyi (ルドルフ・アンドレニ伯爵 ,Rudorufu Andoreni-hakushaku?) ;\nTaisaku Noto (能登 泰策) comes from Colonel Arbuthnot (アーバスノット大佐 ,Ābasunotto-taisa?) ;\nMari Idenami (出波 茉利) comes from Mary Debenham (メアリー・デベナム ,Mearī Debenamu?) ;\nNatsue Komino (小蓑 夏江) comes from Princess Natalia Dragomiroff (ナタリア・ドラゴミロフ公爵夫人 ,Nataria Doragomirofu-kōshakufujin?) ;\nHiruka Sumitomo (住友 昼花) comes from Hildegarde Schmidt (ヒルデガード・シュミット ,Hirudegādo Shumitto?) ;\nEtsuto Murobashi (室橋 悦人) comes from Ratchett Roberts (ラチェット・ロバーツ ,Rachetto Robātsu?)
