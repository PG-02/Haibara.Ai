    "Situation": "While on the way to dinner, Conan and the group come across a bunch of people dressed as Kamen Yaiba fans. They are invited to the party where an attempted murder and suicide appears to occur, but Conan begins to wonder if there is more than meets the eye to this.\n\n\n",
    "People": "- 21 years old\n- Jonan University Law Department\n- Cosplaying as Kamen Yaiba\n- 21 years old\n- Women's University of Shirakaba Literature Department\n- Kamen Yaiba fan club president\n- Cosplaying as Rei Natsume\n- Victim (gunshot - injured)\n- 21 years old\n- Jonan University Engineering Department\n- Cosplaying as Laser Police\n- Victim (gunshot)\n- 21 years old\n- Toto University Physical Education Department\n",
    "Resolution": "- Deceased (truck accident)\n- Osamu's younger brother\n- Elementary school boy\nConan knocks out Kogoro with his stun gun wristwatch and begins to reveal his deductions with the voice changing bowtie. It was no suicide but it was actually a murder. Someone had this planned out right from the beginning. The person could have suggested, something like this to Mishima, that they should put up an act at the party, so that they could give people a scare. For this act, they quarreled before everybody so as to lay the setting for today.\nThe killer is Osamu Honda. Honda first modified two guns of the same model and then prepared two different kind of bullets. First which would be a real bullet, and the other one an empty blank. The gun that Honda gave to Mishima before the whole performance was the one with blanks. Before the official opening for the party in the morning, Honda met Mishima at the temple and handed over the gun to him and brought the gun that had the real bullets inside. Honda's excuse would be that he needed to check the gun. That means that the gun on Honda's waist is Mishima's gun. The gun that Honda gave to Mishima wasn't sealed at all because he was afraid it would be involved afterwards. Honda chose a Laser Police costume instead of the Kamen Yaiba costume he usually wore. That's because only the Laser Police have guns, and it also wouldn't be strange if he wore a bullet-proof vest.\nJust when Mishima dashed in, Honda purposely moved a few steps so that the other people wouldn't be caught in the fray. This also let Mishima get a good aim at his target. Since Mishima had no knowledge of guns, he didn't feel like anything was wrong when he fired the gun. Honda had considered the gunshot and the movement as nothing strange as they had practiced with Mishima. So when Honda saw Mishima being shot down, he misunderstood it, since it had the same effect as when they were practicing, and believed that it was going as they had planned beforehand. Mishima didn't commit suicide because if he was someone who really wanted to commit suicide, he would have pressed the gun to his temple and pulled the trigger. There should be burn mark on his temple. Mishima doesn't have any burn marks on his temple, because even it was a blank, it would still have left some burns. At that time, he didn't want to hurt himself and didn't press the gun against his head.\nAs evidence, the crime scene investigator found that they were other fingerprints on the gun besides Mishima's. The fingerprint on Mishima's gun and the fingerprint on Genta's Detective Boys Badge (which Conan gave it to the crime scene investigator to check it) is the same. The other fingerprint belongs to Genta. Genta never touched Mishima's gun, but then why were Genta's fingerprints found on the gun? Before Honda went to the party, Conan and the Detective Boys met Honda at the temple. At that time, Genta touched the gun. That means, that the gun Honda had on was later used by Mishima at the party. It proves that Honda's gun has been swapped with Mishima's.\n",
    "Motive": "Some time ago Mishima, who was a Kamen Yaiba fan to the point of mental illness, had stolen Honda's little brother's extremely rare Kamen Yaiba poster while he was riding his motorcycle; the poor boy ran after Mishima's motorcycle and was hit by a truck, dying two days later. In his last words, the younger Honda begged his brother to \"capture that Kamen Yaiba\".\n\n\nHonda joined many fan clubs to find the person who had caused his brother's death. A year and a half after the accident, he found his brother's poster in Mishima's apartment. Mishima himself lied and said it was a gift from his own brother, though Honda knew that Mishima had no siblings with the name Hiroshi. Honda then engineered the meeting of Kamen Yaiba fans to trick the mentally-unbalanced Mishima into first shooting him, then committing suicide under the belief that it was all an act.\n",

    "Trivia": "- The Revolver in case is Smith & Wesson Model 36.\n- The dub has Shinichi wondering if Kogoro has ever heard of AA after Kogoro accepts the party invitation after hearing about the involvement of a beer keg. AA is the abbreviation used for the group Alcoholics Anonymous, a self help group known for using group therapy in order to assist people who struggle with alcoholism.\n"
