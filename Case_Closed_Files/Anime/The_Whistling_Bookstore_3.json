    "Situation": "Michiko Yoshikawa invites the Detective Boys to Kosuke Omura's writing class, as she wants to learn how to write a novel. The class is held at Ryoji Nojima's house, who sponsored Omura for his books. When Nojima reads how the children write a story, he decides to take them to the basement, where he keeps many valuable books. He asks the group to start reading the book he handled for references.\nDuring lunch break, Michiko reveals that she cut her finger on a book. Ayumi then gives Michiko a band-aid. Moments later, she suddenly collapsed. She is later taken to the hospital.\n\nThe police found out that one of the book has a highly-concentrated poison on it. Conan then realizes that the book cover color is Paris Green. It is later being confirmed by Yujiro Tamaki that it is the color that was produced using a powerful poison in the past. Michiko most likely touched the book unconsiously.\nHowever, after Conan found a book with bloodstains and a scratch on the shelf, he knows who is the culprit.\n",
