    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran and Conan are walking on Beika streets at noon, as Kogoro wants to bring them to an italian restaurant. When Ran asks why, he answers that there's a free drink for every person. Suddenly, the sound of a fire alarm is heard by them, and it turns out the restaurant catched on fire! They witness how a man enters the restaurant, and Kogoro decides to enter too, and tells Ran to call the fire department. Kogoro rescues the man, and asks Ran to call the police too, as they saw a dead man inside. The fire department and Inspector Yuminaga arrive at the scene, and discovered how the fire started: yhe fire originated after a pot of oil caught on fire after a gas burner was left turned on. Then, Kogoro shows Inspector Yuminaga the dead body, but surprisingly the man didn't die because of the fire, but was killed.\nThey deduce a burglar broke in, as the restaurant was closed, but when they saw how someone was inside, they killed him and made the fire on purpose. The dead man's identity is revealed to be the 39 year-old's italian restaurant cook Marcello Salerno. Then, the restaurant owner Ryutaro Kurasaka arrives at the scene, and the man who entered the building is revealed to be Jun Akimura, a waiter. Kurasaka states that no one held a grudge against him, as he was a good-natured and cheerful italian man, but suddenly Akimura says that he ran a tight ship. They see how some dishes were made by him, even if the restaurant was closed, and how one of the tables was arranged and prepared beforehand, meaning that the victim probably invited someone to dinner. Outside, a woman cries about Marcello's death, the woman is revealed to be Kurasaka's daughter Mariko, who was also Marcello's assistant. Mariko also had a strong rosemary scent, that makes Yuminaga suspect her. Suddenly, another woman arrives, but this time it's revealed to be Marcello's wife Arisa Salerno. She says that she wasn't sure if she could help, as she and her husband were separated and about to divorce. She also was the one Marcello wanted to meet, and that's why he prepared the dinner, but as she didn't know where the restaurant was, she decided to leave without arriving. After that, Conan deduces that Marcello made a breakup dinner for her wife, but the message that stated that wasn't on Marcello's phone, and in the phone there was only a message in italian language. Conan then listens how Akimura started to blackmail Kurasaka, as Mariko and Marcello's relationship. Kogoro was recreating how they found the body, when he bumps into a cart, that made Yuminaga suspect about how the murder was done. Many clues -like the same set of footprints and the utensils in the sink- revealed that the victim continued cooking until he died, and Conan wonders if the victim erased the culprit's footprints. When Ran goes search for him, he asks her what are the dishes in the cooking list: Bagna Cauda, Milanese-style risotto, Picatta and Tiramisu. But there's an extra dish made by the victim, that made Conan being sure about how the murder happened...\n",

    "Resolution": "",
    "The Truth Behind the Fire": "Conan starts his deduction by sleeping Kogoro. He reveals that the cart on the back door wasn't part of any trick, but was used to transport the victim's body, as the culprit didn't want them to know that they commited the murder in the restaurant. But when the culprit returned, the kitchen was on fire, so they had to flee. There's only one possible explanation: the fire and the murder aren't connected at all, and that the victim continued cooking after being stabbed, then died, and as the gas burner was turned on, the kitchen caught on fire.\n",
    "The Real Culprit": "The only dish that wasn't on the list were squid fritters. Kogoro states how Arisa mentioned how she and her husband were about to divorce, but she threw away her ring even before divorce. Kogoro asked Yuminaga to examine the squid fritters, and there he finds a shocking truth: Arisa's wedding ring, that was there even if Arisa never visited the restaurant before. She indeed was waiting Marcello on the table, but then she saw how he and Mariko were flirting in the kitchen, she denies it and says she was apologizing to him after her dad wrongfully fired him, and Akimura found about what Kurasaka planned to do and started to blackmail him. Mariko then left, and she got into an argument with her husband, throwing her ring at him and finally stabbjng him, meaning that Arisa Salerno is the real culprit behind this case.\nShe doesn't regret about what she did, as Marcello only told her sweet words, but after that he started to flirt with another women. Kogoro then tells her why Marcello hid the ring in the fritters: he wanted to protect his wife, as she will be suspected immediately, thus he cooked the fritters and hid the ring after regaining consciousness, and after finishing them, he finally passed away. That's how the fire started and why there were that many footprints on the floor, even if they were the same. Marcello even deleted Arisa's message from his phone. Finally, Inspector Yuminaga showed her the translated message left by Marcello's mother: she wanted him to apologize to his wife and break with his affair partners, as family was the most important treasure on life. Arisa finally breaks into tears and now repents about what she did. She is finally taken into custody.\n",
    "Aftermath": "",
    "Trivia": "- This marks the second time in 12 years that the character Inspector Yuminaga appears in an anime original episode.\n- The restaurant name in Italian \"Ieri, oggi, domani\" means \"Yesterday, today, tomorrow\".\n"
