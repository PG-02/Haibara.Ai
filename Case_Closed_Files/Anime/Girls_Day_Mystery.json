    "Situation": "In Professor Agasa's house, after rejecting Ran's invitation for shopping at the Beika Department Store, Conan sat on top of the sofa, and was watching a TV drama named \"Flying Squir Murders\", while urging Agasa to tag along. Agasa brought some pizza and they began to watch the TV drama.\n\"We two girls should enjoy today to our hearts' content!\" exclaimed Sonoko, who was shopping with Ran at the Beika Department Store, which was as crowded as ever. After all the fun and excitement, they encountered Haibara and Ayumi just by chance, when they were chilling on top of the roof of the shopping mall building. In addition, Sato also passed by, and the reunion of the five old acquaintances instigated an afternoon tea at the Beika Department Store restaurant. Sato explained that she came here to seize the limited edition pear sweets from Tadano Fruits Parlour. This brought up their following conversations, nevertheless, after mentioning about Megure's funniness, Sonoko uttered that she noticed someone who acted very strangely on the third floor: a man dressed in green, with a peculiar hair style that contained yellow and black, who bumped into the two girls. He was mumbling to himself and kept looking at the ceiling, with no intent of buying clothes. Ayumi afterwards also pointed out that she also saw a man acting weird on the sixth floor: a man in a shirt with a pattern of sun. He was not looking at the paintings that were displayed in the art gallery, but instead, he chose to peer at the empty white wall. Ran later remarked that she saw another man looking queer as well on the roof: he wore a black trench coat, sunglasses, and possessed short black hair, he was also mumbling to himself while looking at the sky, trying to figure out the direction of the wind using his fingers. And after hearing all of the speeches given by the others, Sato also could not stand concealing anything, she confessed that she saw a curious man too, on the ground floor outside the department store: he was rather stout and strong, wore a pink shirt, and was pushing a stroller while mumbling to himself. The most intriguing thing was, the stroller was empty. They attempted to consider all of these as solely coincidences, but Haibara deduced that it might not be the case if too many repetitions emerged. She said that it was possible that their mumbling was in fact the communication between each other through the radio. Therefore, Sato concluded that they were most likely planning to implement a crime. Sonoko speculated that the thieves might be targeting the huge diamond in a jewelry exhibition named \"Harry Murzabayev Design Diamond Collection Special Exhibition\" on the sixth floor which will take place from the 1st of August onward.\n\nThe five of them decided to keep an eye on the incident at least and investigate it. Ran called Shinichi for help, and at the same time, Ayumi called Conan. Unfortunately, Conan was too fascinated by watching the detective drama to realize the two phone calls ringing from his phones. Sato leads the others to the \"World Mask Exhibition\", which was still open, and met the security guard, Kazuo Takahashi, who told them the security system for the building: during business hours, there were forty guards overlooking every floor; after business hours, the exits will be locked and only the service entrance will remain open; all visitors will be thoroughly checked when entering the exhibition; six guards will be constantly looking at the images captured by the security footage; once every three hours, they will patrol the building; the security footage will cover all areas and there will be no blind spots; the security footage will be stored on the cloud; every door had a sensor installed and will notify the guards if forcibly broken; during the diamond exhibition, they plan to double the number of guards. So the security system was impeccably flawless, then what was the point of them poking around and acting suspiciously?\nThe only place that the building did not have guards watching was the rooftop, thus Sato requested the security guard to strengthen the security there as the suspicious man measuring wind direction on the roof was seen by Ran. After meeting with the security guard, they went to the karaoke and rented a room to \"rehearse\" the criminals plan. Which was basically to pretend being the robbers and trying to simulate the most realistic scenario that may be advantageous for capturing the real criminals. Sato interrupted her and proposed to gather clues first, and the others started to analyse the situation: the man looking at the ceiling was trying to check security cameras; the man watching at the walls was trying to find a way to get in without breaking the door and activating the sensors; the man measuring the wind direction also showed that they intend to sneak in from above; and the last man with the empty stroller, maybe he was checking out the traffic conditions on the ground that will make their way out of the building. There were also some notable clues pointed out by the girls: they all wore flashy clothes, they all had weird hairstyles, and they had weird stickers on their car. Haibara also surmised that since the security footage was stored on the cloud, it would be susceptible to getting hacked, which might also be part of the robbers' plan. Here goes the robbery rehearsal imagined by the five girls: the thieves attempt to enter from the skies → Hack into the security system and turn off the alarm → Incapacitate the guards → Avoid the sensors on the doors → Destroy the walls → Enter the building → Acquire the diamonds as quickly as possible → Flee using their car on the ground floor. Although their simulation seemed plausible, Haibara went into a deep contemplation, and kept staring at the large diamond on the exhibition promotion poster. She said something, which suddenly hinted Sato. \"I see. So that's how it is.\" Sato uncovered the truth, the scales fell from her eyes. \"I know what they're actually after.\"\n\"They're the culprit!\" on the other hand, Conan, who was watching the detective drama with Agasa, also knew the truth of the detective drama. Agasa doubted Conan's deduction, however, Conan confirmed it with a cocksure face. But he never knew that a formidable robbery show was taking place at the Beika Department Store.\n",
    "People": "- Robbery suspect, looking around the ceiling for no reason\n- Robbery suspect, looking at the art gallery walls for no reason\n- Robbery suspect, measuring the wind direction on the roof for no reason\n- Robbery suspect, pushing an empty stroller for no reason\n- 28 years old\n- Beika Department Store head security guard\n- Famous Mexican mask-maker\n- Legendary pro-wrestling champion\n- Morela's close friend and client\n",
    "Resolution": "At night, unsurprisingly, the thieves sallied. As predicted, they had used hang-gliding, which helped them swing across in the sky from the roof of another building. After landing on the roof of the Beika Department Store, and they were about to begin their crime, several spotlights opened and shined directly onto the three thieves. They were the suspicious men who were mumbling around the department store during the day. Sato arrested them for burglary and claimed that their accomplice, the fourth theive, who was waiting downstairs for them near their getaway car, was also arrested at the same time.\nSato deduced that the actual target was the pro-wrestling mask, which was on display right now. That mask was precisely the one Sato stared at when they went to consult regarding the security mechanism of the building with the security guard, Kazuo Takahashi. Incidently, the mask display would end just tomorrow, and after that, the diamond exhibition would take over, on the 1st of August as mentioned, so they would definitely dispatch this night. That mask was a masterpiece made by a famous Mexican mask-maker called Morela. It was priceless because the pro-wrestling champion El Desto once wore that mask in his title match. Ayumi then took the bait and remarked the four suspicious men's hair styles looked like those of pro-wrestlers, so they must have some sort of relationship with them.\nIn addition, the stickers on their getaway car also indicated something, for example, \"I love Caras\" referred to the Spanish word for face, and in the wrestling context, it can be seen as the masks wore by pro-wrestlers. The three thieves, looking at the crowds of police that surrounded them, kneeled and confessed their crimes. Later, it was revealed that the robbery group was actually called the Masked Leotards crime group.\nIn the end, the five girls met up once again to celebrate their success in capturing the robber group. They felt pride as they were able to solve the case without Kogoro or Conan/Shinichi's help. Sato also praised Haibara's insight for declining to call it a coincidence. They all agreed to gather another day and solve another case.\n",
