    "Situation": "Soaked in the steamy-hot water from the Sufutsu Hot Spring, Professor Agasa, Mitsuhiko, Genta, and Conan were having their good time. Owing to the fact that it was a mixed bath, the girls did not come along.\nOn the other hand, at the Sufutsu Resort, Sonoko, Ran, Ayumi, Haibara, and Sato met once again after the previous reunion. As Ayumi explained, Sonoko and Ran were there to snowboard[N 1], Sato were there to snowmobile[N 2], and Haibara and she was there to fish. After knowing that Takagi could not come with Sato due to a leg injury, the girls began to experience all projects within the ski resort. Everyone had fun and retired to their dwelling. In the meantime, they were rejoicing their \"girls' day out\"; Detective Sato was also delighted to not think about cases anymore. Haphazardly, the girls heard some trepidations from the resort staff, whose name was Satoko Yamaguchi; she was speaking with Shu Kitada, the highly-aged resort manager, with fear. Out of curiosity, Sato stepped in and inquired of the matter.\nHaving known that she was an off-duty police officer, the resort manager decided to disclose the fuss: weird things began to happen at the ski resort four days ago; a huge snowman cropped up unexpectedly in the resort venue, then the following day, a mystical signboard was hanged on another area within the resort, later even an igloo emerged out of nowhere. At first all of the resort staff member had speculated that it might had been built by some sort of weirdo guests. Yet after checking the security camera footage, they realised that things might not turn out that simple. The person who apparently had built these did not show their faces or clothing within the camera footage, instead, only black clothes were seen. Strangely, today, the fantasy had brought up to another level - some tress in the resort were painted white. The resort manager Yamaguchi took it to be a prank, so he was not so willing to remove them. Kitada then proposed another possibility: that is, these series of \"pranks\" might be related to the robbery incident from two years ago...\n\nAfter this incident took place, weird and creepy things had begun to happen within the resort. For example, many guests witnessed the presence of zashiki-warashi; random holes on the hotel walls; the sudden appearance of giant snow sculptures over night. Sonoko got utterly motivated after learning about the case details. She then instigated the rest to investigate the case for the resort staff. Despite she proclaimed herself as \"the great Detective Queen\", she could not notice any clues by inspecting the weird appearing objects. To break the deadlock, Sato informed the girls to collect some more clues by questioning some resort employees.\nUndergoing some inquiries, the information they had learnt were none other than \"the manifestation of earrings' curse\", \"igloo was considered to the be best place for snack eating\", or \"the mascot of the resort is named Miruko-san\" etc. Meanwhile, Ayumi attempted to call Conan, and Ran attempted to call Shinichi; just like last time, Conan was detached from his phone hence he could not hear the ringtones. When everyone could not find their way out of the labyrinth of puzzles, Haibara picked up the fallen promotional flyer of the ski resort from the paper-white-coloured floor. As she held the flyer with the white side in front of her, she compared it with the snow-white-coloured surroundings - This time, she understood everything, just like Conan. Without bothering to explain, Haibara declared that they needed to visit the security guard of this resort ASAP. When they arrived at the security room, they found the guard fainted upon the floor.\n\n\"I knew it,\" said Haibara. She urged the others to check the camera footage out in the security room - clearly, she noticed something fishy with the camera footages.\n",
    "People": "- 26 years old\n- Sufutsu Resort employee\n- 60 years old\n- Sufutsu Resort manager\n- Victim (bashed - injured)\n- Sufutsu Resort security guard\n- Sufutsu Resort Sled Dog Experience employee\n- Sufutsu Resort bellhop\n- Sufutsu Resort employee\n- Sufutsu Resort mascot character\n",
    "Resolution": "Haibara pointed out the fact that some camera footages were not rendering the stuff that they should be: monitor 3, 4, 7, and 8 were working properly yet nothing could be seen from it. This was because they were obstructed by the snowman, signboard, igloo, and the white-painted trees. Yes! The culprit did all of that to cover the security cameras. She then went on and explained that, at this time of the year, the utilisation of this trick would not be spotted immediately as the whole resort was covered with snow. Then, most probably, the security guard also noticed the pattern, this would explain why he would end up being attacked afterwards.\nTo think deeper, they narrowed down the suspects: the first person that the security guard would contact must be the resort manager, and the only person that has the authority to remove the weirdly-constructed igloo and snowmen was also the resort manager, Shu Kitada.\nHaibara then drew out an announcement online, which recorded that the Kitada was about to retire from his job as the resort manager at the end of the month. According to this, Haibara conjectured that this was Kitada's last opportunity for the diamond earrings, because he would be retired some weeks later.\n",
    "Finding the Hideout": "The intent of him blocking designated security camera footages was to not let other people see him passing through. As such, the place were he had obstructed the camera with weird stuff must be the only way to the diamond earrings' hideout.\nPassing through all the blocked cameras, the final destination was... the skating rink! When they opened the door of the building, Kitada had already left the place, leaving a small hole dug on the ground, and obviously, the diamond earrings had already been taken away.\nTo after the resort manager, Sato, along with Sonoko, decided to have a car chase with the culprit Kitada. In the meantime, Conan and Genta decided to have a battle in playing ping-pong.\n",
