    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "On a rainy day, Kogoro decides to reward himself after gaining a lot of money from the investigation, with Wakita asking where Conan could be. As it turns out, he went to the building where the Detective Boys, Rumi and Kobayashi are cheering Shiratori as he is participating in the tournament, with Kobayashi giving him the knight keychain as a lucky charm.\nWhen Haibara and the Detective Boys are discussing the strongest chess piece, Rumi asks her why she knows too much around, in which Conan replies as Agasa taught her how to play chess and other knowledge as well. Later, the group meets up with other tournament participants, including Kurumi Shiroi, Kinji Ogarawa, Naoto Kishitami and Kunikazu Kisaki, with each of them having their own chess piece as a lucky charm. Ogawara mentions that a chess player named Ryoichiro Saso used Amazing Grace as his phone tune, only to be betrayed by the tune itself.\nIn the tournament, Shiratori faces Kuroda but suddenly someone’s phone rings, causing Shiratori to be distracted and he is then declared lost. However, when the two meet up with Kobayashi’s group, Shiratori loses his lucky charm somewhere, so he has to go back to the tournament to find it. Kuroda then greets Kobayashi and Rumi, he also mentions that he had met Rumi somewhere, even before the event of the burning tent murder case, in which she denies.\nIn the waiting room, Shiroi, Ogawara and Kunikazu discuss the ringtone played in the match after they hear a strange sound. Later, Ogawara’s glass suddenly breaks when he is going to have his drink, which makes him scream in fear. And apparently, an arrow has flown through his glass and hit his bag. Conan and Kuroda then try to find the culprit’s trace following the open door, and when they pass by a different “cleaning up” sign in the restroom, Conan opens the restroom and sees Kishitani being dead with several arrows in his body. At the scene there are also a crossbow, a magazine, and a knight keychain which Conan confirms it belongs to Shiratori.\n\nKuroda informs this and Shiratori being a suspect for him, Shiratori explains that indeed he was in the restroom to find the lucky charm, but there was no “cleaning up” sign, and apparently someone was using the restroom as well, so he tried to find it in stairway. He also mentions that he needed to use the phone to inform his butler about the result of the tournament. The Police arrive and begin listening to their report about the incident and deduce that the culprit must have escaped, but Conan deduces that this is not a suicide and the suspects are: Shiroi, Ogawara, Kunikazu and Shiratori, as Kuroda can confirm that no one used the elevator in this floor, and Shiratori was in the stairway when he was looking for the lucky charm.\nWhile Kunizaku expresses that something is wrong when the Police trust a boy like Conan, Kuroda points out that his jacket seems to have a strange tear. Shiroi mentions that they heard a strange sound after returning from the match, and they find an arrow in the wall where they heard the noise.\nThe Police ask what the suspects had done after leaving the match, Kunikazu was buying drinks in the vending machine after he left the match with the victim when Shiroi and Ogawara showed up, after hearing the noise, he just played game until the glass broke; Kishitani received a message when he was buying drinks like Kunikazu, the message frightened him so he ran away to somewhere; Shiroi was going along with Ogawara until she went to the bathroom to see the match again with earphone, so she didn’t notice much of noise outside; Ogawara says that he also used the restroom when he separated from Shiroi, he noticed one of the toilet but didn’t know it was Kishitani, after using the restroom, he went to the waiting room with others.\nWhen Megure takes the charm out, Conan can finally see the bloodstained side of it, this reminds both Wakasa and Kuroda of something long ago while Conan is deducing. Megure also states that there is a bloodstained crossword page, indicating that the victim may have left his last word there. The Detective Boys and Haibara mention that there were 2 glass boxes in the trash bin, one with nothing, one with shattered glasses. Conan then smiles, indicating that he knows the truth behind.\nOutside the building, Rum is seen smiling in his car with his cigarette.\nConan calls Agasa to ask how long it takes for him to bring the item, he answers that he has completed the requested item and it’ll need 10 minutes to get there as well. While at Conan place, Ogawara asks if the three players are out of the suspicious range, with the other two confirming that then the culprit must be Shiratori. The Detective Boys and Haibara justify that he can’t be that kind of person, even though he has curly hair, which makes Shiratori speechless. Conan begins his deduction.\nThe culprit is Kinji Ogawara.\nPerhap with the knight keychain and when he was murdered by the culprit, he used his brought along magazine and the keychain for his final word, with the bloodstained page acting as the chess board.\nKishitani has a habit of always turning the knight towards him, while the blood stains on the pages of the aforementioned magazine were from both queens; meaning the knight from the queen side had gone to the opponent side, pointing that the bloody handprints is in the king side, while “king side” in Japanese means ousama no gawa or ogawa.\nAgasa comes and speaks about Ogawara’s broken glass trick.\nConan continues, first he had his pen with a small hole, then he prepared two glass boxes, each with one Rupert’s drop, in case one is broken; then he shot an arrow that is separable between the body and the arrowhead; finally, he took one drop to the glass with drink and used the pen to break all together, faking that someone had performed a shot to his glass and hit his bag.\nKuroda deduces that Ogawara shot at the vending machine early, tried to end the match with Shiroi early; after he met with others, he sent a message to Kishitani to meet him in the restroom and tore Kunikazu’s jacket, next, he put out a fake “cleaning up” sign and killed the victim then return to the waiting room with others.\nWhen Ogawara tuned in “Amazing Grace” in the window, only Kishitani looked at his bag until the song stopped, meaning that it was Kishitani’s phone that rang one year ago made Ryoichiyo Saso panic, so he tried to see if it was his phone or not but the song stopped. Even though he was allowed to continue, but others kept suspect him, he eventually committed suicide with a note that the ringtone was not him. It turns out that Saso was just trying to help Kishitani feel calm, but the latter didn’t think like that as he just wanted Saso to feel scared like him.\nAfter the case is over, it is revealed that Kuroda was the one to let Agasa in, as he entrusted him after Conan said that Agasa would demonstrate an experiment that would help solve the case. Before the Detective Boys, Rumi and Kobayashi can go along with him to have lunch as the tournament is now cancelled, Kuroda asks if he can borrow Conan for a while as he has several questions for him. So the sooner group then waits for Conan, without anyone, except Rumi, knowing that they are being watched by a camera, which turns out to be Rum and his subordinate who are giving the target for the elimination for Korn and Chianti.\nPossessing excellent memory, Rum accurately identifies all bodyguards seen with Amanda and orders his people to capture and incapacitate them.\nRum also notes that a Japanese man he saw is also a person of interest and orders his agents to also take care of him. However, when attacked, Kuroda is able to take them both down.\nHaving noticed that Rum and his agents are outside the door, Amanda sends Rachel to Haneda's room to retrieve a knight from her chess set to keep her away from the encounter. When Rum comes into the room, he explains that now that they know Rachel is like a daughter to her, the organisation can use that information and now recruit and force her to help them. Rum presents the APTX 4869 pill to Amanda, showing the alternative, but in an unexpected moment, Amanda voluntarily jumps forward and ingests the pill.\nAfter Rachel reaches Haneda's room, Haneda reveals that Amanda likely sent her away on a wild goose chase on purpose, as there is no way that someone would miss the fact that a knight was missing from the chess case because of the specially designed crevices for each piece. Haneda tells Rachel to hide when Rum and his agents knock on Haneda's door, asking if they have seen a Japanese woman. Haneda says no and swiftly shuts the door. He then goes on to taser Rachel and hide her in the bookcase in his room. Rum then comes back again and notices that the order of the books has slightly changed from before and, knowing that Rachel is hidden in there, reaches out to remove the books. Before he gets the chance, Haneda drops his act and tells Rum he remembers seeing him in the news. Haneda is then repeatedly beaten and eventually fed the APTX 4869 pill. Before he dies, he leaves a final message by cutting up a mirror with the text \"Put on mascara\"\n\nAfter bursting into Amanda's room, Kuroda realises that the special guest Haneda said he was going to play chess with was in fact Amanda, so, sensing something is off, he rushes to Haneda's room. There, he finds that Haneda is also deceased. At this time, Rachel wakes up and, under the assumption Kuroda killed Haneda, begins attacking him. In a moment of shock when she sees a photo of Amanda's corpse on Haneda's phone, she lowers his guard and gets knocked out by Kuroda. Rum and his agents outside the hotel see chess notes flying out of the hotel, and Rum deduces that Rachel will be snuck out of the hotel using the bookcase again. However, as they reach Haneda's floor, Kuroda, wheeling a suitcase with Rachel in it, manages to sneak by. After Rum realises that Rachel was in the suitcase, him and his agents get in his car and begin chasing Kuroda's vehicle. However, Kuroda's car ends up being ran into by a truck and his car catches on fire. Seeing the commotion, Rum decides to step away.\nIn his last moments of consciousness, Kuroda asks an EMT about how the female in his car was, and the EMT says that only he was found, suggesting Rachel escaped before the ambulance got there.\nBack in the modern day, as Kobayashi and the children begin to exit the building, Conan realises that Rachel (now Rumi) deliberately swapped her umbrella with Kobayashi's to avoid being noticed, meaning that Chianti and Korn are going to shoot Kobayashi.\n",

    "Resolution": "At the last second, Rum notices that the boots of the target did not match Rumi's and ends up calling off the shot but not before two bullets are fired.\nChianti and Korn, being disrupted by the message, end up missing their shots.\nIn the meantime, after escaping in a rain poncho, Rumi Wakasa steals a gun from a nearby firearms store.\n\nSeeing Chianti and Korn's location, Rumi begins shooting at them, hitting Chianti in the shoulder.\n\nRumi Wakasa was the culprit of the robbery at the nearby firearm store for a weapon to fight back those who are attempting to kill her. She purposely broke Kobayashi's parachute so she could suggest using her own parachute. The purpose was that when Kobayashi and others are out, Korn and Chianti, the snipers would then see Kobayashi as the target and shoot her, which will reveal the place where they are standing so she can shoot them with the gun from the firearm store.\nThe two snipers manage to hide from the range of Rumi's scope and Chianti erases the blood she shed and together with Korn, they retreat from the mission. Rum regrets the failure, and wants to use APTX-4869 to turn back the clock to when his right eye still could see properly. Rumi then has flashbacks of Kohji Haneda's sacrifice.\n",
