    "Clock tower Heist": "Kaitou Kid stands on top of Tōto Tower with his assistant, Konosuke Jii, about to steal the Black Star. He recalls the time he encountered Shinichi Kudo in his attempt to steal the clock tower.\n- 53 years old\n- Tower owner\n- 32 years old\n- Futoshi's assistant\n- 27 years old\n- Birth date: June 2nd\n- Tokyo policeman\n- Single\n- Tokyo policeman\n- Tokyo policeman\n- Futoshi's late father\n- Former mayor fifty years ago\n- Renowned architect\n- Clock Tower's constructor fifty years ago\n- Kaitou Kid girls' fan club member\n",
    "Detective's Gathering": "Kogoro receives an anonymous invitation to a banquet with 2 million yen enclosed. Five other detectives were also invited. They are in an old mansion in the isolated mountains of Matsumoto, a Nagano Prefecture's rural area at 2 kilometers from Okuno Dam, where a massacre happened forty years ago. One of the detectives are killed and they are stranded in the Sunset Manor as the bridge and cars were blown up. It also appears the sender's name on the invites was code for Kaitou Kid. Through a tape recording, the host tells the story of a treasure hidden inside the mansion and makes the detectives find it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Victim (explosion)\n- 63 years old\n- Detective\n- Victim (poison)\n- 39 years old\n- Birth date: January 29\n- Detective\n- Victim (poison)\n- 51 years old\n- Detective\n- Victim (kidnapped)\n- 23 years old\n- Maid\n- Victim (poison)\n- 29 years old\n- Detective\n- Ex coroner\n- Multi-millionaire\n- Previous mansion owner\n- Died forty years ago\n- Furuyo's late father\n- Archaeologist\n- Went missing\n- Saguru's pet hawk\n- TMS cars shop clerk\n- Gasoline stand owner\nThe one who killed Ogami is Furuyo Senma.\n- The poison, potassium cyanide, was coated on the top of everyone's teacup handle. Ogami was the only victim as only he had a habit of chewing his thumbnail when thinking. Although everyone had wiped their cutlery, dishes, and cups just in case of poisoning, Senma predicted that Ogami, being an accomplice, would not think he would be targeted and was lax with the wiping.\n- In order to prevent the rest of the detectives and guests from being killed too early, Senma voiced her hate of cigarettes to stop heavy smokers Kogoro and Mogi from smoking and being poisoned.\n- After she successfully murdered Ogami, Senma would then propose a plan to check out the bridge. By using a second coin, Senma would always be among those to go. She then pretended to be killed by explosion, and secretly returned to the mansion and hid in the secret monitor room, waiting either until the detectives solved the mystery of the mansion or killed each other off.\n- The reason that Conan and the rest realize that Senma was the perpetrator of the crime was because she purposely picked the farthest 10 yen coin when deciding who should check out the bridge: if someone else picked the coin, they would've noticed the chemical reaction between the potassium cyanide and the bronze coin.\n",
    "Motive": "Senma and Ogami were co-conspirators and had arranged for the detectives to arrive in an attempt to have them find the treasure for them, with the maid Aki Ishihara being Ogami's original poison target in this scheme. However, Senma double crossed Ogami and killed him with potassium cyanide.\nThe backstory about Renya Karasuma was mostly a lie. The true tale prompted the current tragedy and Senma's motive for seeking out the treasure. Renya Karasuma had inherited the mansion from his mother and, forty years ago, but he was unable to solve the riddle. Greedy for the treasure, Renya hired academics to solve the case for him, and then began killing them as motivation to solve the case faster. Those murders were the true cause behind the bloodstains in the house, not an out-of-control party caused by two wanderers with drugs. Senma's archaeologist father was one of the academics.\nLike Renya Karasuma, Senma wanted to know the answer to the treasure hunt that took her father's life at all costs. Sensing that Ogami's greed had got the best of him and that he would kill her after they had found the treasure, she poisoned him using his nail biting habit. She had planned to fake her death, have the other detectives find the treasure and kill them, but they were not fooled. All the detectives who killed each other are alive all along.\nInstead, she is tricked into confessing to Conan, who reveals the true secret of the treasure: the entire mansion is actually made of gold. The solution lies in the riddle given to the guests.\n- The two travelers who looked up at the sky refers to the hour and minute hands of the clock at 12:00, which is only found in the dining room.\n- The King who took the chest of treasure refers to King of Diamonds, who faces left, meaning rotate the minute hand counter clock-wise by 13 x 5 = 65 minutes.\n- The Queen who shed tears in a holy grail refers to the Queen of Hearts, who faces left, meaning rotate the minute hand counter clock-wise by 12 x 5 = 60 minutes.\n- The Knight who stabbed himself with his own sword refers to Jack of Spades, who faces right, meaning rotate the minute hand clock-wise by 11 x 5 = 55 minutes.\n",
    "Afterward": "Saguru reveals that he had sent Watson to his baaya to call for a police helicopter for them to escape the mansion. On the helicopter, Senma tries to commit suicide by jumping off the vehicle, but Kogoro who is revealed to be Kaito Kid saves her.\n\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- The manga does not fully reveal that the clocktower heist is a flashback from Kid, immediately preceding the events of Conan vs. Kaitou Kid, until the very end. The anime adaptation reveals it from the start, as it begins by playing the opening scene of episode 76 from Kaito's and Aoko's perspective, followed by quick shots of Kaitou Kid's notice from that episode and the Black Star itself.\n- In the manga, Inspector Nakamori tells Inspector Megure about the code that Kid left behind while still hanging onto the clock face. In the anime, he relays this information while standing by his squad car. This causes a small plot hole, as Nakamori had been clinging to the clock face only seconds ago.\n- In the manga, Kaito bears a few scuff marks when he reunites with Aoko at the bottom of the clock tower and repeats his rose trick. In the anime, his face is completely clean.\n- The story when Akako Koizumi saw the prediction of person who is to take care of Kid, Akako's associates, and Akako's attempt to cast spells was not adapted. It was later added when the heist part of the episode was release in Magic Kaito Volume 4 Treasured Edition bonus DVD.\n",
    "Akako's new scenes": "Initially, when this episode aired, during the clock tower heist, the part where Akako started to use her magic to try and help Kid escape, only to be stopped by her assistant, is not adapted due to magic not existing in the Detective Conan universe. In 2011, the heist part was released in a bonus DVD of Magic Kaito Volume 4 Treasured Edition, and the scenes were added.\nNew Scene Staff\n- Organizer / Storyboard / Technical Director: Toshiki Hirano\n- Animation Director / Key Animation: Kenichi Otomo\n- Sound Director: Keiko Urakami\n- Mixer: Hisashi Yamamoto\n- Sound Effect: Aki Yokoyama\nAkako's new scenes [CLICK TO REVEAL]\n",
    "Rerun": "This episode was rerun on October 6, 2003.\n",
    "Remastered version": "The Gathering of the Detectives, the second part of this special, was remastered and reaired on May 18 and 25th, 2019, before Search for Maria-chan!. Several scenes were cut and many OST were changed.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is the second episode to be digitally animated, after The Cornered Famous Detective! Two Big Murder Cases.\n- At the start of the special, Kid's notice from Conan vs. Kaitou Kid is shown. However, \"April fool\" is misspelled as \"A prill fool\". Another mistake is that the aforementioned notice is shown again when Nakamori's assistant reads Kid's notice about the clock tower.\n- The host dummy wears a frightening phantom's purple hood with only two eye slits, just like the members of the KKK, one of the secret societies that were the sources of inspiration for the Black Organization.\n- Each of the detectives introduced in this case evokes a famous literary detective:\nSenma, an unassuming old lady, evokes Agatha Christie's Miss Marple.\nOgami, a heavy-set man with a love of fine cooking, evokes Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe.\nMogi, a slim, wisecracking \"tough guy\", evokes Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe.\nSoda, a medical practitioner who focuses on forensic evidence above all else, evokes R. Austin Freeman's Dr. Thorndyke, albeit a woman instead of a man.\nSaguru, though a previously established character from Magic Kaito, is clearly meant to evoke Sherlock Holmes.\n- Senma, an unassuming old lady, evokes Agatha Christie's Miss Marple.\n- Ogami, a heavy-set man with a love of fine cooking, evokes Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe.\n- Mogi, a slim, wisecracking \"tough guy\", evokes Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe.\n- Soda, a medical practitioner who focuses on forensic evidence above all else, evokes R.
