    "Situation": "At Ristorante Sundayrino, Kogoro, Ran, and Conan are invited by Kogoro's friend, Raita Banba, to attend his pre-wedding party. Banba's bride, Hatsune Kamon, leaves to have her nails done. Shortly on her return, she receives a phone call at the parking lot that shocks her. She calls Banba, bidding him farewell, and her car is engulfed by fire.\n\nThe police arrive and their DNA test reveals a rough match of Banba's DNA was found on Kamon's nails insinuates him as the murderer. Banba proclaims innocence and reveals the culprit is most likely Tooru Amuro, their waiter who has secretly met with Kamon. Amuro explains he was hired by Kamon to investigate Banba and see if he was having an affair; To attest to his alibi, Amuro reveals Banba also hired a detective to follow Kamon for the same reasons. The detective confirms Amuro's identity and leaves Banba as the main suspect. Conan investigates, finds out that Kamon was making secret phone calls, and learns from Amuro that she was disturbed to discover Banba and her were orphaned by the same hotel fire.\nA second DNA test with sterile samples reconfirms the rough DNA match leading Conan to a conclusion.\n",
    "People": "- 37 years old\n- Groom\n- Kogoro's high school friend\n- Victim (burned)\n- 37 years old\n- Bride\n- 48 years old\n- Detective\n- 29 years old\n- Detective\n- Banba's friend\n- Banba's friend\n- Banba's friend\n- Banba's friend\n- Tokyo MPD CSI officer\n- Sundavirino waitress\n- Amuro's coworker\n",
    "Resolution": "The rough match also proved that Hatsune and Banba were twins who were orphaned in a large fire that destroyed a whole neighborhood, more than 30 years ago. The surviving but orphaned twins were initially raised together in a church, then separately adopted by loving families, but didn't find each other until their adulthood.\nHatsune already had some suspicions due to how alike they were. When she heard that they were rescued from the same hotel fire, she decided have a DNA comparison done by a doctor and the results proved the two were brother and sister and therefore forbidden to get married. Already stressed because of her poor health (she was born with a genetic illness known as Turner's Syndrome, which made her look very different from Banba nevermind them being twins), Hatsune was so devastated that she ended her life where it began: in fire. Raita himself had no idea of the truth behind their birth, and once Conan-as-Kogoro revealed it to save him from being blamed for her death, he was last seen crying and screaming Hatsune's name.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Monozygotic (identical) twins can really be born with opposite genders even though it's really rare. What happens is that on the cellular division something goes wrong and one of the fetuses gets XYY chromosomes and the other one X0. The XYY fetus is born a male porting Jacobs syndrome, meaning he has more testosterone production, making him aggressive as portrayed on this episode. The X0 fetus is born a female porting Turner's Syndrome, meaning she's short, infertile, born with cardiac problems and others, just as shown on the episode.\n- The love between close blood relatives is called Genetic Sexual Attraction, often shortened GSA, which also happened in Diplomat Murder Case though Yukiko Katsuragi and Takayoshi Tsujimura are step siblings.\n- Many episodes present an apparent suicide that turns out to be a murder; the exact opposite happens on this episode.\n- Raita Banba (伴場 頼太) comes from the character \"Ramba Ral\" (ランバ・ラル ,Ranba Raru?) ;\n- Hatsune Kamon (加門 初音) comes from the character \"Crowley Hamon\" (クラウレ・ハモン ,Kuraure Hamon?), the wife of Ramba Ral ;\n- Sanji Haruoka (春岡 参治) comes from \"Zanzibar\" (ザンジバル ,Zanjibaru?), Ramba Ral's car.\n",
