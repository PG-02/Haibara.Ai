    "Situation": "Kogoro has just solved a case of running away from home due to failing the entrance exam, which was actually thanks to Conan finding a photo of the missing person on the internet. The Mouri family decides to go eat in Gunma prefecture, but Kogoro doesn’t believe what Conan has just looked up on the internet and decides to ask Yamamura, while Ran grumbles in her mind that they found the person thanks to the internet.\nHowever, as soon as he hears that Kogoro is in Gunma, Yamamura asks him to come because at the crime scene on the border of Gunma and Nagano, there are three Nagano police officers who looks scary to Yamamura, whom the Mouri family immediately recognized as the police trio Taka'aki Morofushi, Kansuke Yamato, and Yui Uehara after they arrives.\nYamamura seems surprised that the Mouri’s family knows the Nagano Police trio, though he has met Kansuke and Yui in a serial murder in Tokyo. He looks at Taka’aki as he explains that he didn’t join the said case, though Taka’aki looks familiar to Yamamura. Back at the scene, as it turns out, the Nagano trio came first, and when they came back with their coroner, Yamamura was there and accidentally messed up the crime scene. What makes it worse is Yamamura can’t completely recall the pose of the victim before he touched it, which is why Kansuke just wants to get him off the case, but Taka’aki steps in and offers collaboration between two prefectural police.\n\nThe victim is a streamer who makes videos to gain profit from advertisements. He also went there with some fellow streamers, who are currently the main suspects of the case. The Nagano Police decide to interrogate them again, this time with Yamamura and the Mouri’s family. First, the woman named Yumi Nakata says that she heard a strange noise outside the window at 11:00 pm, and when she opened the window to look outside, she saw a body in the parking lot and a person wearing a hoodie sweatshirt running away from the body, so she called Gunma prefectural police; next, the woman name Kyouko Hoshikawa is almost identical but she called Nagano prefectural police and the ambulance; the two then informed this to Senta Hanayama.\nAnd the reason for four of them to come to the hotel was… compare the deliciousness between 2 specific foods, with Yamamura and Kansuke saying the food in their prefecture is better. Conan notices that there is a camera, with the Nagano trio having already watched but still decide to watch again with everyone. It is seen in the footage that the victim tried to find the border and looked at his watch when being beaten by the culprit, which means that he was trying to say something with Nagano-Gunma or with the border.\nWhen Taka’aki is deducing, Yamamura keeps looking at his face and tries to ask about Taka’aki and later figures out that the latter was Hiromitsu Morofushi’s brother. He expresses that no wonder Taka’aki looks similar to Hiro and tells him about his childhood time with Hiro when he met him at the Nagano-Gunma border, they even share a base together but one question he kept in mind was why Hiro occasionally called that Misao’s home. But Hiro suddenly disappeared due to peculiar circumstances. Back to the present, Kansuke mentions Hiro as a police officer, in which Taka’aki replies that he has left the unit and can’t ever be contacted again.\nBack to the investigation, the murder weapon has now been identified as a sock and the aforementioned hoodie, and it appears that a heavy object was used to put into the sock to turn it into a murder weapon. Conan, Kansuke and Taka’aki deduce that the culprit must be one out of the three interrogated people, with Conan explaining why they can conclude that through the camera footage, so another and much further interrogation has to be made to find the true culprit. The first one is Nakata, Conan reveals that he has recorded the footage and wants to confirm the woman in the footage, with Nakata praising him for being so smart, however, Kogoro suddenly drops a picture in her room, which sparks Conan’s curiosity.\nConan asks her about the woman who is not present here, which she says was Chizu Yaba and suggests Conan to ask from the other two as well. Next, Hoshikawa tells them about Yaba and the miraculous rescue which everyone was talking about on the Internet, but recalls that Yaba was found injured after falling from a staircase in a building when the four were shopping. Finally, Hanayama was watching a show on TV with an employee who confirmed that as he called curry for dinner. Taka’aki asks him about Yaba, which he mentions that the victim was acting weird toward the accident.\n\nSuddenly a call for food from Hanayama’s phone reminds everyone to have lunch. It’s also revealed that Taka’aki and Kansuke have found the weapon used to murder the victim, with Yamamura finally recalling about the pose when he sees Kogoro pose upon finishing his dishes, the truth is then revealed.\n",
    "People": "\n- Victim (bludgeoned)\n- 30 years old\n- Live streamer\n- \"Moon & Star\" channel member\n- 28 years old\n- Live streamer\n- 27 years old\n- Live streamer\n- \"Moon & Star\" channel member\n- 31 years old\n- Live streamer\n- Victim (fell - injured)\n- Car crash survivor\n- Currently in a coma\n- Deceased (fell)\n- Chizu's mother\n- Kogoro's client\n- Woman's missing son\n- Fuyuna Pass Hotel security guard\n",
    "Resolution": "She then tied a string connected to her curtain and attached the other end to her first cellphone and set it on the edge of a table next to the window. After she murdered Kazuki, she dialed the number of her first cellphone with her second one, which caused the phone to fall off the table pulling the curtain open. This gave the illusion that she had opened her curtain to peer outside, which was also captured on the surveillance camera.\nYumi used a blackjack to kill Kazuki, it involves placing a heavy object into a sock and swinging it with enough force to kill someone. She used Kazuki’s sock and an object of her own to create a blackjack. Detective Kansuke deduces that she had hidden the object in question in her hair bun, he noticed this as Detective Uehara also had her hair in a bun, but she has longer hair. While a photo revealed that Yumi’s hair was shoulder length, which meant that she did not have enough hair to tie it into a bun. Uehara undos her hair, which reveals a wrist weight that was hidden in her hair bun.\n",
    "Motive": "Detective Uehara asks why she didn’t just discard the evidence, but she didn’t have the heart to as the wrist weight was given to her by Chizu Yuba. Chizu had given to her as she did not have time to exercise or go to the gym.\nKyouko and Senta ask why she killed Kazuki and she reveals that she did it in revenge for him causing the death of Chizu’s mother and for putting Chizu into a coma. Years ago, the four of them Kazuki, Kyouko, Senta, and Yumi all came across a car accident, where Chizu and her mother were trapped in their car that was hanging off a steep cliff. They quickly managed to save Chizu, however the car ended up falling down the cliff killing her mother. However, Yumi found it strange as she knew they had enough time to save both of them and yet they failed.\nYears later she learned the truth, Chizu had been looking around Kazuki’s laptop and found a video that he recorded of that fateful day. The video revealed that when Kyouko and Senta was attempting to save Chizu’s mother, Kazuki stopped them and told them that it would be better to save her when the ambulance came as it would look more heroic. However, as they were discussing this, the car ended up falling down the cliff which lead to Ms. Yuba’s death. Horrified that she had been lied to, Chizu recorded a copy of the video on her phone and sent a copy to Yumi, who was just as shocked after learning the truth.\nChizu confronted Kazuki with the video and out of fear he chased her to the stairs, where she fell and was left in a coma. After Yumi learned the truth, she intentionally invited Kazuki, Senta, and Kyouko to the hotel to kill Kazuki in revenge. She also intended to frame Kyouko and Senta for his murder as she also held the two of them responsible for what happened to Chizu and Ms. Yuba.\nYumi believes that if she hadn’t kept the wrist weight, she could’ve have gotten away with the murder. However, Detective Kansuke reveals that it would have not mattered as Kazuki with the last of his strength left a dying message with his own body. He positioned his body along the border between Gunma and Nagano to reveal the identity of his killer. He positioned his body to mimic Kanji and with the line going down the middle of his body, it spelled out her entire name: Yumi Nakata.\n",
    "Aftermath": "Yamamura wonders why Hiro calls their shared base his home, which Conan explains when the entrance sign dangles and some other conditions along, double down the sign and you get the word Misao. Next, Yamamura mentioned that he received a strange postcard 5-6 years ago saying that they would come to his house. He waited all day there but no one showed up.  \nThen Taka'aki asks about that secret base and they all go there and explain about the letter. After flipping the entrance sign to Misao, we can see that Hiro has become a police officer like Yamamura, but Yamamura is sad that Hiro gave up on his dream. Taka’aki encouraged him and explained that Hiro had been promoted to the police security force, so he could not keep in touch with his relatives and friends to ensure his identity. \nIn the end, Taka’aki hasn't revealed his brother’s death to Yamamura because, after all, Hiro was a dear friend of his, and he wants to keep his hope that both of them are currently serving justice.\n",
