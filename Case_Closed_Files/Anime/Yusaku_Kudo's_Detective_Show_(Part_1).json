    "Situation": "After exiting the police headquarter and being interviewed by reporters, Yusaku Kudo reveals that he is going to do a live broadcast solving three locked room murders that took place on the last days, but three days later, on the day of the show, Yukiko Kudo tells Conan that Yusaku suddenly got food poisoning and has a stomachache, and that she will disguise as him, and with Conan's help, solve the case. Yukiko reveals details of the murders. The first victim named Atsumi Morita, an apparel company employee, was killed in the bathroom of her apartment after being pushed to the sink and hitting her head with it twenty days ago, the bathroom door was locked and the scene was ransacked, with various bathroom items on the floor. The one who found the body is Saiko Yumekawa, Atsumi's friend, who is known for conducting interviews using a pink mic. She is also the reporter coming for the live broadcast.\n\nThe second murder took place ten days after the first murder. The victim, Taiji Kiryu, a permanent-part time worker, was stunned with a stun gun and later strangled with a rope in the entrance of his apartment. The scene was also a mess with garbage, bags and used ramen cups. It seems he fought back while being strangled and the culprit's skin got in his fingernails.\n\nThe third and last murder was done the next day after the second murder. This time, the victim Koretsugu Kanzawa, a baker, was stabbed on the abdomen with a knife in the kitchen of a house in Haido. Like the previous murders, the scene was also a mess with multiple kitchen objects on the floor, including the knife used as weapon.\n\nYusaku deduced that the three murders were locked rooms and that they were locked from inside. When Conan goes to Yukiko's room, it turns out Yukiko also feels bad and it's revealed that she got food poisoning too. But suddenly, Kaitou Kid (disguised as Yusaku) appears to \"repay the favor\" that Yusaku did by clearing accusations made against him. Conan and Kid only have 10 minutes until the TV staff arrives to the Kudo household.\nConan tells Kid the details of the murders. The time of the show arrives and Yusaku (Kid) will be solving the case with the help of Conan.\n",
    "People": "- ToTo TV announcer\n- Atsumi's close friend\n- Victim (bludgeoned)\n- 24 years old\n- Apparel maker\n- Victim (strangled)\n- 31 years old\n- Unemployed\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- 47 years old\n- Baker\n- Nichiuri TV reporter\n- ToTo TV newscaster\n- ToTo TV staff\n- Nichiuri TV cameraman\n- Nichiuri TV production assistant\n- ToTo TV cameraman\n",
    "Resolution": "It's showed an exact recreation of the three crime scenes (the bathroom, the entrance and the kitchen, including the items and the door) including all the items on every murder. There are three things in common in every crime scene:\n- A thumb-thurn lock on the locked door.\n- An item that can be used to grip something and hang something off of (a hair clip, chopsticks and tongs respectively).\n- A bag-like item with some weight that could be attached to the previous items (a bag with a hairdryer, a garbage bag, and a frying pan). To avoid suspicion, on the last murder a frying pan was used instead of a bag, the frying pan is black instead of silver like the rest of the objects, showing that the culprit bought it to the exact length as well as the tongs.\nTo do the trick first is needed to attach the hair clip, the chopsticks and the tongs to the thumb-turn lock, next hang the bags (and the frying pan) to each object and placing them on the door handle, then carefully exit the rooms and finally from outside turn the door handles to make the weight objects fall with the items attached to the lock, making the lock rotate and finally locking the rooms.\nYumekawa made various mistakes that showed her as the culprit:\n- In the first crime scene (Morita), the upper shelf wasn't ransacked because if ransacked (with the help of a bath brush), it would indicate that the murderer was a short person.\n- The noodle cups in the second crime scene (Kiryu) had all the chopsticks on the left side of the cup (even thought the victim was right-handed), indicating that the culprit was left-handed. Yumekawa is left-handed, as she uses her mic with her dominant hand.\n- Finally, Yumekawa's wristwatch was on the dominant hand (a rare thing to do, as people usually wear them in their non-dominant hand) to cover the scratch done by Kiryu during the fight back.\nShe finally confesses that she told the victims through in-game chat that she wanted to test a locked room trick (the same used for the murders) that she came up with and asked the victims to do it in their homes, they said it worked and complimented her, convincing her that it would be a good idea to make a name for herself with the trick, but Atsumi used it first in the online novel she was writing, so Yumekawa asked to delete it, but in a fit of rage she accidentally pushed her to the sink, killing her. She used the trick because she didn't had other choice, and the others (Kiryu and Kanzawa) began to suspect that she was Atsumi's murderer, so she had to kill them too. Yusaku asks her why she chose to be the reporter in-charge of the broadcast, and she answers that wanted to try to fool him face to face, but finally she didn't make it. Finally, the police arrives and arrests Yumekawa.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- Some dialogues are added:\n- Yusaku realizing the TV station that interviewed him.\n- Yusaku asking Kid to send his address so he could send a copy of his novel.\n- Yukiko mentioning that Yusaku solve the case in three minutes, so four hours should be enough for Conan.\n- In the manga, Megure is shown in the background when Yusaku mentioned about him. It is removed in the anime.\n- In the manga, Koretsugu Kanzawa has black hair. In the anime, he has grey hair and looks bald.\n- The anime adds original scene where Ran is just coming home and is going to prepare dinner so that she won't miss Yusaku's TV show. Kogoro then wondering why they ask a novelist to solve the case and not a detective.\n- To avoid repeating the case explanation during the first part, the anime makes some changes:\n- In the manga, after Kid arrived at study room, Conan directly explains the case. The TV staff arrives when Conan explained the 2nd victim. After the conversation with Yumekawa, Conan asks Kid how he know Yusaku is sick, before continue their discussion about the case.\n- In the anime, after Kid arrived at study room, Conan asks Kid how he know Yusaku is sick. The TV staff arrives not long after that. After the conversation with Yumekawa, Conan goes to see Yusaku and Yukiko in their room, before returns to living room where Kid is waiting for him to explain the case.\n- In the manga, during the live broadcast, Conan just hide behind the table. In the anime, Conan hides under the table.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The name of the characters come from videogame titles[1]:\n- Saiko Yumekawa (夢川 彩子) comes from Final Fantasy (ファイナルファンタジー ,Fainaru Fantajī?), the \"yume\" (夢) stands for \"dream/fantasy\", while \"saiko\" sounds phonetically similar to \"saigo\" (最後), which means \"last/final\";\n- Atsumi Morita (盛田 敦美) comes from Animal Crossing (あつまれどうぶつの森 ,Atsumare dōbutsunomori?);\n- Taiji Kiryu (桐生 泰二) comes from Dragon Quest (ドラゴンクエスト ,Doragon Kuesuto?), the \"ryu\" stands for \"dragon\" (竜), while \"taiji\" sounds phonetically similar to \"taiji\" (退治), meaning \"extermination\", as this what the players do in the game;\n- Koretsugu Kanzawa (菅沢 惟次) comes from Kantai Collection (艦隊これくしょん ,Kantai Korekushon?).\n- Starting this case, Andre Camel is voiced by Kenji Nomura, replacing Kiyoyuki Yanada, who suddenly passed away on November 14, 2022.\n- The drawing of Yusaku and Akai towards the end of the case is directly traced from the manga.\n",
