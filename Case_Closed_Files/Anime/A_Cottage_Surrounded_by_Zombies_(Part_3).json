    "Situation": "Conan, Kogoro, Ran, Heiji, and Kazuha are going to a cottage located in Gunma Prefecture because of a crime that happened there. Kogoro feels sick, so he wanted to go in the toilet but when he came out, he feels weak because he ate a poisonous mushroom. According to Conan, when someone eats the mushroom, they feel its deliciousness but also feels it's poison.\nKogoro goes into the forest and found some delicious mushrooms, when he ate it, he got poisoned. So he took a rest, supposed to be in the director's car, but Takashi was nowhere to be found. Heiji and Conan searched everyone's rooms. After that, Takashi has already died. They tried to called their cellphones but there's no service.\n\nThey found a video leaning on Takashi's room, when he drinks the water, he was poisoned already. They discussed the case eight years ago.\n\nHis plan was not successful, it backfired and caused him to die.\nAt that time, while Kogoro was not healed, he saw some zombies on the window. Heiji cuts the head of a zombie, and it was humans who startled it. They learned about the zombie party before.\n\nConan and Heiji solve the case.\n",
    "People": "- 38 years old\n- Movie director\n- 29 years old\n- Actress\n- Victim (poison)\n- 30 years old\n- Producer\n- Victim (throat slit)\n- 30 years old\n- Camerawoman\n- 29 years old\n- Lighting technician\n- 29 years old\n- Soundman\n- Deceased (starved)\n- Tetsuto's younger brother\n- Horror club president\n",
    "Resolution": "Conan reveals that the way the killer knew the movie subtitle was that they used a toilet paper roll to block out the light and make the words on the paper visible through the envelope. As for Takashi's body, it was placed on the missing trolley cart and hidden in the back portion of the dresser where parts of the drawers had been removed to create a cavity on the inside. This was the same trick that Joji had used for his disappearing act 8 years ago. The drawers had become stuck in place when the crew had moved the dresser to look for him. However it was a trick that he couldn't do alone.\nThe culprit is Ria Kawabata. She helped Joji perform the trick but did not realize he had become stuck. His death was truthfully an unfortunate accident. A while later Takashi found messages from Joji inside the dresser where he had scratched in blood that he blamed Ria for his death. Takashi then began to blackmail Ria, which is why she killed him. Kyoko was killed because she realized that the video used for Takashi's death was the one from eight years ago.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga, after noticing the zombies in the window, Heiji and Conan wonder if they might be movie extras, with Heiji later noting that they must not be after hearing the film crew scream in reaction to the zombies. This does not happen in the anime.\n- In the second part of the case, between the moment where Conan grabs a boom mic to defend himself and the moment that the window breaks, there is a scene where Heiji tosses the chair he grabbed to the side and runs off to grab the Zombie Sword prop, leaving behind a very frightened Conan who in confusion asks where Heiji is going. While the scene is brief, this does not happen in the manga.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The zombie blade featured in this case resembles the Devil King Sword used by Takeshi Onimaru from Yaiba, one of Gosho Aoyama's previous works.\n- The names of the suspects come from zombie movies[1]:\n- Tetsuto Naitō (内東 徹人) comes from Night of the Living Dead (ナイト・オブ・ザ・リビングデッド ,Naito obu za ribingudeddo?);\n- Ria Kawabata (河端 理亜) comes from The Return of the Living Dead, released in Japan under the name Battalion (バタリアン ,Batarian?);\n- Takashi Harawaki (原脇 崇) comes from The Evil Dead (死霊のはらわた ,Shiryō no harawata?);\n- Kyōko Ejiri (江尻 恭子) comes from Day of the Dead (死霊のえじき ,Shiryō no ejiki?);\n- Orie Baishō (倍賞 織江) comes from Resident Evil, released in Japan under the name Biohazard (バイオハザード ,Baiohazādo?);\n- Masahachi Ninomiya (二宮 雅八) comes from 28 Days Later (28日後... ,Nijūhachi nighi go?) and 28 Weeks Later (28週後... ,Nijūhasshūgo?);\n- Jōji Naitō (内東 丞治) comes from Night of the Living Dead as well as George A.
