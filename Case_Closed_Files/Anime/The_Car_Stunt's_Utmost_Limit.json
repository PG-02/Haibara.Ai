    "Situation": "The Detective Boys visit a Kamen Yaiba stunt show. The director, Shinji Fukamachi, and assistant director, Hidehiko Nakasato, scold the stunt driver, Kengo Rikiishi, for doing such a dangerous stunt with the car, a blue 1997 Chevrolet Camaro RS. Kengo blows off their words and has cameraman Daisaku Kijima retake his next shot later. The directors tell Rikiishi that he was to wait for a remote control car identical to his own to do the off the roof scene, which angers Rikiishi and thinks the crew don't respect his skills as a driver. Fukamichi sees the mechanical technician, Masao Nishiwaki, about the readiness of the cars for a retake. The kids go and meet with the crew, and Mitsuhiko and Genta go see the cars. Genta places a sticker on the remote control car to make it look cooler, but the technician comes to take it to the roof. The kids are having fun until they hear a fight. Rikiishi has had enough of the director telling him not to do the stunt again so he does it again in a blind rage, which is caught on film by Kijima. As he makes it to the top, Rikiishi doesn't get out and the car flies off the roof.\n\nConan sees that the seat belt was loose, meaning Rikiishi tried to get out, but something prevented him from getting out. Conan and the crew look at the footage of the event. Then someone alerted the police and Conan pursues them. The kids mistake Conan's actions as him investigating without them, and follow him to the roof where he says the accident was a carefully planned murder. Meanwhile, Inspector Megure takes statements from the crew, who explain Rikiishi's want to do the stunt was what killed him, and they begin fighting with each other, saying who they think is the killer.\n",
    "People": "- 30 years old\n- Director\n- 28 years old\n- Assistant director\n- Victim (car crash)\n- 38 years old\n- Stuntman\n- 40 years old\n- Cameraman\n- 45 years old\n- Mechanical technician\n",
    "Resolution": "Fukamachi was the one who prompted Rikiishi to do the stunt. The stunt was supposed to use two different cars: Car A, which was a regular car, Car B, which was remote controlled. Rikiishi originally wanted to complete the stunt in one take with one car, and Fukamachi claimed to have gotten permission to do so. But Rikiishi was later was goaded into performing the stunt and switching cars by Fukamachi, who took advantage of his competitive personality. When Rikiishi drove up to the roof, he had swapped from Car A to Car B. Conan shows the sticker was on the car as proof- except Genta says he put one on both cars. But then Conan shows the corner of the coat was caught on the door of car that crashed, but not on the one on camera when it started. This proves that the door had been opened at some point.\nConan pulls the remote control from Fukamachi's pocket and has Nishiwaki prove the crashed car is the remote controlled Car B. Once Rikiishi swapped cars, Fukamachi operated the car via romote control to drive the car off the roof. Fukamachi had locked the door and tampered with the seat belt to trap Rikiishi in as he fell. Fukamachi confesses and states that he was in debt and used had the production money to pay it off. He killed Rikiishi to keep anyone from finding out about it.\n",
