    "Situation": "Ayumi decides that on the Detective Boys camping trip, she will attempt address Ai Haibara by her first name and to call her \"Ai-chan\". While driving Conan talks to Professor Agasa about the black organization. Agasa reveal that there a bit more to the Itakura's diary. After the woman spoke in English she hung up the phone after a cat meowed in the background. Agasa reveals that he knew Haibara's father Professor Miyano through meeting him at conventions. He describes him a friendly man who complimented his inventions. But his wife was the strange one. Her name was Elena and Agasa had heard that she met professor Miyano when she came from England to Japan to study. During the camping trip, they run into four college students, who are a club called 'The Outdoor Club'. Each contribute to the club in their own way, Yasumi is a great cook, Reiji is the driver, Takuto is skilled at fishing and finding eatable plants and Haruka is paying for everything. Haruka claims that she doesn't have any real talent like the others, so paying is all she can do. The club offer The Detective Boys a ride in their campervan to the top mountain to watch the fireworks. While driving down the mountain, one of the four college students, Yasumi Shirafuji, is found on the road dead.\n\nEvidence atop the mountain suggests Shirafuji lost control of her bike and accidentally went over the cliff. Conan reveals that there is a lack of blood on the cement raising the possibility it was a murder made to look like an accident and that the suspects are the three college students.\nAfter a thorough investigation, Conan finds out how the body was placed on the road and who the murderer is.\n",
    "People": "- 21 years old\n- College student\n- Victim (bashed)\n- 22 years old\n- College student\n- 21 years old\n- College student\n- 23 years old\n- College student\n",
    "Resolution": "Conan then reveals the culprit to be the college student Haruka Tendo, evidenced by her change of clothes. Conan reveals that she changed to a pair of similar jeans but when she was putting her jeans on she missed a belt loop (evidenced by a photo that they took earlier showing her jeans with the belt looped perfectly) and that she threw away her other jean as it was covered in Shirafuji's blood. Tendo confesses and reveals that she was pretending to be rich, because she thought that an ordinary talent-less girl from the country side wouldn't make any friends on her own.\nShe worked hard and took out loans to pay for their expensive trips, but she pulled through. Then she found out her friends knew the truth yet only used their relationship for money, understanding that Haruka would use a lot of money to keep up the charade. Shirafuji had followed Haruka home one day because she was suspicious and saw that she lived in a apartment complex, instead of the rich house she claimed to live in and decided to tell the others as a result. Yasuumi flippantly badmouths Haruka while Reiji out of desperate greed decides on letting Haruka continue giving them money so that he can join a race derby and then terminate their relationship by the end of their graduation.\nTakuto was the only one of those three who suggested that they should tell Haruka that they knew the truth, and yet he didn't do it himself. Tendo thereby aimed to kill Shirafuji and frame Reiji for the murder should the accident theory be debunked. Haibara however, criticizes Tendo out of shame, saying that she should have known that money could have never gotten her real friends in the first place and that it was wrong for her to kill out of this reason alone. Tendo along with Reiji and Takuto after hearing this are left in shame.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The camp car driven by the four college students (Reiji Fukuura, Yasumi Shirafuji, Haruka Tendo, and Takuto Meshiai) is a 2001 Toyota Camroad Leo.\n",
