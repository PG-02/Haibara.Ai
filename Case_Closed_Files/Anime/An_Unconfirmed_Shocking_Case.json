    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan are walking down the street past several construction sites. One in particular used to be a bathhouse, and as they pass by, they hear a loud crash from the construction site.\n\nThe bands that held the pipe has marks suggesting that they had been deliberately cut, so this is not an accident, but a murder. The murderer would have to climb the stack to cut the bands to kill the victim, but other than the victim, none of the three workers approached the scene of the crime. Kaneda's knife is found at the scene, making him the prime suspect. Conan has his doubts, and investigates to find out how it is possible to cause this fake accident. He engages the culprit along with Kogoro's voice.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (crushed)\n- 56 years old\n- Owner\n- 27 years old\n- Yuuji's driver\n- 36 years old\n- Site supervisor\n- 48 years old\n- Architect\n- \"Fan Fan\"'s curator\n- Tokyo MPD CSI officer\n",
    "Resolution": "Murase had likely stolen the knife from Kaneda the previous day. He used that to make cuts on the inside of the bands, where they wouldn't be seen, and tied the bands slightly tighter than usual. He used a pitching machine from the \"Fan Fan\" building next to where the crime had been committed to shoot a ball at the steel bars, causing the bands to break and the pipes to fall down. This is how he caused the fake accident without being seen or risking getting crushed himself.\nHis shoes have red threads from Fan-Fan's carpet floor and his footprints were left on Fan-Fan's waxed floor, proving that he went there. After returning to the scene of the crime, he would have to dispose of the ball somewhere. It was found in the debris pile.\nMurase admitted to loathing Inomata. Inomata had used cowardly methods to buy plots of land for cheap to build his chain of spa resorts: one of which was a bathhouse owned by Murase's family. His mother passed away from an illness, and his father committed suicide. But he hated Inomata for rejecting and insulting his design concept incorporating the bathhouse, and thereby insulting and destroying his father's memories.\n"
