    "Situation": "Eisuke returns to school and Ran and Sonoko take him to karaoke to celebrate his return. Conan notices that there is a strange man following them and presumes he is an FBI agent sent to keep an eye on Eisuke. While there, Eisuke disappears to the bathroom for a suspiciously long time, and returns with a horrified expression. Shortly after the strange man is found dead from repeated beatings to the head with a blunt weapon.\n\nConan suspects Eisuke to be the murderer due to his strange behavior after returning from the bathroom. However, Eisuke explains that the reason he was so horrified was that while he was heading back to their karaoke room, he stumbled into the wrong room and found two men kissing. The other man whom he saw kissing is revealed to be a woman who looks masculine since she is a body builder. The woman gets mad over the mistake, while Arimoto seems more understanding over that someone could mistake her for a man. The police decide to interrogate the four suspects, including Eisuke, for the murder.\nThe police search the rooms of the four suspects for the blunt weapon used to murder Tatsumi Moniwa. The pictures on Moniwa's cameras were developed revealing pictures of Sonoko. Conan realizes that the man is not an FBI but a stalker who was targeting Sonoko.\n",
