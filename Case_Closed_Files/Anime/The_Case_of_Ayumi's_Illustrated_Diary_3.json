    "Situation": "Conan, Haibara, and the Detective Boys went shopping, and suddenly, they heard a scream from the \"Tanning Salon Kurosawa\". This is how Ayumi's third illustrated diary began. Everyone sallied forth into the salon, and they saw Yasuo Tsunoda, who was in a panic. When Conan enquired him what the matter was, he pointed out that one of the customers of this salon, Shin Nishitani, was dead inside room number nine, which was the third room from the back.\n\nConan walked towards the dead body and claimed that it was of no use. And discovered that there was something covered on the victim's skin. After looking at the tanning gel tossed nearby the tanning machine, this might be the poison that killed Shin. Haibara also deduced that it was obvious that the victim was a bodybuilder from his build. Takagi and Chiba arrived and started investigating the case.\nThe first suspect, Masaru Ozawa, is also a customer who regularly visits the salon. He claimed that they did not speak much and thus were not very close to each other. He also denied the fact that the victim had any enemies. Yasuo spoke for Masaru, saying that Masaru is currently a three-time student bodybuilding champion. He also believed that Masaru would most likely win the upcoming bodybuilding contest. The second suspect, Takeshi Nagano, is always regarded as Masaru's rival by the public. He had the determination to overbeat Masaru and win the contest. He said that he also knows the victim, and he was his junior at his school, called Beika International University. Moreover, the school's bodybuilding club is called \"Beikoku Body\". He also confessed that the victim had made a big purchase lately, but he did not know what it was about. On the other hand, he also seconded the statement that no one held a grudge against the victim, Shin. Later, the corpse analysis was released, and the poison was found inside the gel that covered the victim's body. The gel container nearby the victim also contained poison. Nevertheless, no poisoned gel containers were found in the other tanning rooms. This made the crime seem even more impossible, as when the Detective Boys arrived at the entrance of the salon, the corridor light was closed and it was rather dark. It would be far too difficult to see someone's face in the darkness. There would be no way for the culprit to enter the room and poison the container without being noticed, and if the culprit waited beforehand, there must have been someone who saw the culprit's face. Meanwhile, rooms seven, eight, and nine were usually used by Masaru and Takeshi, and not by the victim Shin evidently. As a result, the suspicion of Yasuo, the salon employee who knew in advance that Shin wanted to use the advanced room that day, rose sharply.\nThe range of suspects was then quickly narrowed down to Yasuo Tsunoda, the salon employee. He is the only person who would have known which room the victim would enter at the outset and had the opportunity to poison him beforehand. There was also a possibility of indiscriminate murder since Masaru was staying in the tanning room near the victim's room. Conan inquired of Yasuo concerning the structure of the salon. Yasuo explained that only rooms seven, eight, and nine in the back out of the ten rooms in the salon are exclusively special, as not only are they bigger but also have high-powered machines meant for advanced tanners. Another suspicious point was that the victim had always used the standard machines to tan, but remarkably, on the day of the crime, he mysteriously entered the high-powered machine room.\nThe Detective Boys and the police went to gather information from Shin's coach, Randy Moore. He also accounted Shin as a nice guy who had no enemies. Randy said Shin looked up to Takeshi and thus copied every move made by Takeshi. For example, whenever Takeshi starts a new training program, Shin copies it. Even so, the coach said that Shin had not arrived at the top level of competition. On the other side, the case seemed to be making huge progress. Inside the trial room, Chiba found out that he had been constantly embezzling the salon's profit and also found a poisoned gel container inside his bag. Still and all, Ayumi thought that the case might not just end like this so easily, and Conan also looked very dissatisfied with this resolution. The most prominent thing is: what is the motive for killing Shin? He never had any enemies, apparently. Conan started to review the case and flipped Ayumi's diary back and forth. And got inspired when Ayumi said the three men looked too alike and could easily be mixed up. Conan discovered the truth in this case after looking at the men's teeth. Conan then realised that the culprit's conspiracy is not over yet, and the next thing he had to do was to evit culprit's next action.\n",

    "Resolution": "Despite saying that he was there to meet Takeshi, Conan still exposed his lies, pointed out that the bottle he was about to take was a poisoned one. Conan recalled Yasuo's remark, which was that Masaru was expected to win from Yasuo's perspective. However, Takeshi exhibited some disobedience. Therefore, Masaru must have been under a lot of pressure for the contest, as his rival, Takeshi, is indeed a stumbling block to his champion's success. So, the culprit's original intent was to murder his rival, Takeshi Nagano. This can explain why he attempted to frame Takeshi even after the murder of Shin.\nMasaru first prepared two poisoned tanning gel container with him, and waited in one of the three advanced tanning rooms, expecting for his original target to arrive. He knew that the victim would go to the advanced room because he heard him saying that he wanted to try the high-powered machine, so Shin stopped using the normal tanning rooms as he used to. After the confirmation that his traget had arrived, he thus entered the two vacant advanced tanning rooms and swapped the normal tanning gel with his poisoned tanning gel container, he did this for both the two vacant advanced tanning rooms. So the victim must enter one of the two rooms. Here, his probability of the crime succeeding was 100% as both of the two vacant advanced rooms had the poisoned tanning gel deposited. And while the victim was inside one of the tanning rooms, Masaru went into the other one, which supposedly should be vacant, and retrieved the poisoned tanning gel back to the normal one. After Yasuo discovered the corpse of Shin, he was very panicked, and the culprit took this advantage. Masaru quickly placed the poisoned tanning gel, which he had just replaced in the vacant advanced tanning room, into Yasuo's bag. He knew the time when the victim would want to go tanning since they are all regular customers in the salon, and it ought not be difficult to estimate the time he arrives at the salon. In addition, the salon record had Masaru visiting the salon three days in a row jotted down.\nThen, what was the motive behind all of this? Shin is a friendly guy, and no one hates him. Masaru killed the wrong person. He intended to murder his rival, Takeshi. But instead, he killed Shin, the person who first time started using the advanced room that day, and having the same type of teeth implants. Owing to the black light (a type of ultraviolet light, higher up in the electromagnetic spectrum than visible light, which is not visible to humans) the salon had during the crime Masaru thought that he would easily recognise Takeshi in this condition because, two years ago, Takeshi replaced most of his teeth with Hybird ceramic implants. And the resin used in Hybird ceramic implants sometimes glows under a bright light. Accordingly, glowing teeth would be extremely noticeable under black light. Haibara then had a flashback about the meteor hunter case, Conan instructed the rest to make a light that would make fluorescent glow. But the culprit had made a mistake, as Shin had been constantly imitating Takeshi's actions recently, and the big purchase he implemented was to copy Takeshi replacing teeth. Thus, Masaru mistook Shin for Takeshi due to the glowing teeth.\nThe culprit got mad and attempted to attack the Detective Boys, but clever Conan tranquilised Masaru just in time.\n",
