    "Situation": "Gin and Vodka are at the \"Polestar\", a high end bar with a live music act. They just wrapped up a meeting with an unfortunate client who walked out with a happy face, not knowing he just had his final drink. Vodka notices that Gin seems enamored by the songstress onstage and praises her voice. At that moment, a waiter delivers two dry martinis to their table, stating that they were from the diva. Vodka accepts them with pleasure, but before he can drink, Gin snuffs his cigarette out in the martini and demands to know what kind of game the waiter is playing. Before the waiter can reply, Gin slams the waiter's head to the table and attempts to spear him with an icepick. The waiter jerks out from Gin's grip, leaving his latex mask behind. The waiter is actually a woman in disguise: the Black Organization agent Vermouth.\nVermouth explains that she was just teasing the two men who were besotted with the singer. Vodka worries that the commotion might have attracted unwanted attention because Vermouth is also a famous actress going by the alias Chris Vineyard. Vermouth reassures him that everyone is too focused on the diva to notice them.\nGin then asks Vermouth if she found \"the one\" she was searching for, and Vermouth replies that she hasn't. Vodka tries to ask for clarification, but Gin tells him it's useless because Vermouth loves keeping secrets. Her catchphrase is \"a secret makes a woman, woman\" because a touch of mystery gives a woman her allure. Gin finds her secret-keeping habit repulsive. In return, Vermouth asks if Gin has found Sherry. Gin says that no traitor can hide from him, and that soon enough he will make both Sherry and the man who protected her at the Haido City Hotel taste true fear.\nMeanwhile, Conan and the Detective Boys are taking the transit bus to a ski resort where they meet Araide and Jodie aboard the bus. Conan felt bored and awaited encounters with Black Organization. Immediately afterward, a suspiciously looking man approached the back seat, but Haibara disregarded, saying the Black Organization members carry a unique smell, which prompted Conan to smell on Haibara herself and earned an annoyed look from her. However, afterwards, Haibara is able to sense that Vermouth is on the bus and hides herself to prevent her from being found. Soon after, the bus is hi-jacked by two armed men who use the passengers as hostages.\n\nConan tries to coordinate with the others and use his gadgets, but is caught by the busjackers every time. He then realizes that one of the three passengers in the back seat is an accomplice of the armed men and is somehow informing them about the passengers' behavior. Conan observes them and notices that one woman is chewing bubble gum, the middle man has some sort of ear piece, and the final man is wearing a mask and coughing often.\n\nThe bus hijackers demanded the police to release their boss Kunio Yashima, who was previously arrested from a jewelry robbery case. To project the hostages, the police conceded.\n\nConan investigates the ski bags the robbers placed in the center of the bus and realizes they contain explosives. Conan then tries to call the police with the earring phone but the spy robbers catch him and take it away. Conan was surprised that the robbers notice and that robber couldn't have notice him with something would cover the view realize that the passenger in the back must be a accomplice.\n",
    "People": "- Hijacker\n- Robber gang member\n- Hijacker\n- Robber gang second-in-command\n- Jewel broker\n- Robber gang leader\n- Passenger\n- Passenger\n- Passenger\n- Deceased?\n- 42 years old\n- OK Trading Co., Ltd. Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n- Bus driver\n- \"Polestar\" waiter\n- Vermouth in disguise\n",
    "Resolution": "Conan reveals that Miharu Tomino is an accomplice of theirs and that they plan to detonate the bombs in the ski bags once they are off the bus.\n- Tomino, disguising herself as one of the passengers, played the role of watchwoman who notify her two fellow robbers of passenger with suspicious action on the bus. Whenever that happen, she pops her chewing gum balloon and uses her finger to remove the gum from her lip to point toward the person's seat position with the number of finger identifies the number of suspicious person. This is why the robbers always looked at the rear mirror, to see Tomino's action, and were able to notice Conan's attempt to call the police earlier.\n- The robbers, pretending to leave the bus with Tomino as a \"hostage\" after ordering Dr. Araide and passenger Shuichi Akai to wear their ski outfits, would then denote the bomb inside the ski bag. Once the police arrive, they would pretend to be freed hostages and give false testimony regarding a fight on the bus which resulted in accidental death of the robbers (the remains of Dr. Araide and Akai in ski outfits) and the rest of the passengers.\n- Tomino's watch is the detonator, as its time always remains at 1:00 pm.\n\nThe Detective Boys are able to inform the driver to stop suddenly which allows Conan to apprehend the criminals. Tomino accidentally activates the bomb giving them a few minutes before it detonates. The passengers leave the bus but Haibara remains seated in the bus.\n\nHaibara plans to die in the explosion and subsequently prevent the Black Organization from finding her and harming those around her. Conan rushes back in the bus, grabs Haibara, and escape through the back window of the bus before the explosion occurs.\nConan covers Ai's leg with own his blood to trick Takagi into taking Haibara to the hospital and away from the Black Organization member who was on the bus while Conan told Ai not to run away from fate. Araide notices Conan's ruse and inspects his bleeding arm. Shuichi Akai is seen reporting to an unknown person and informing them that the target has not appeared.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga version of the jazz club scene, Vermouth never actually says the phrase \"A secret makes a woman woman\" out in English like she does in the anime version. Later, she propositions Gin. The anime changes the conversation to avoid the sexual references.\nManga versionVermouth: (to Gin) So, how about tonight? Want to make some martini?Vodka: Martini?Vermouth: Don't you know? It's gin and vermouth mixed.Gin: Heh. Mixing black and black will only give you black.\nAnime versionVermouth: (to Gin) Hey, let me ask you one thing. Have you found the kitty that got away?Gin: No, but I certainly will. My nose can always detect the scent of a traitor. I'll make her taste true fear... and it'll be the same for the guy she is with.\n- When Conan ran back into the bus to save Haibara, he broke the bus window with a hijacker's gun in the manga. The gunshot was replaced by a kicked fire extinguisher in the anime to reduce gun violence.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Jodie and Conan each compared the other one to James Bond after the incident was over.\n- In the second part of the case, the opening was changed to destiny.\n",
