    "Manga to anime changes": "- Conan and Haibara's clothes are not the same as in the manga at the beginning of the episode.\n- Haibara remarking that Subaru was wearing a turtleneck in summer was left out of the episode because the episode aired in January. Though it was dubbed back in for some international versions that aired later.\n- In the manga, the old lady decides to offer the book Ran wanted to read to her. This dialogue was cut from the anime version. As for Kaito Kid, it was blocked by the bathroom door so he doesn't meet him in person, however, they talked.\n",

The resumed episodes have new voice actors and sport a Mainland Chinese accent as opposed to the original Taiwanese accent.\n- It is revealed that Kaito Kuroba has 4G on his mobile cellphone.\n- This is the first time Subaru met Jirokichi in person in canonical timeline on anime.\n- Kimika Tomoyose's name (友寄 公華) comes from yosegi (寄木), a type of woodworking craft done on traditional boxes.\n",
