    "Situation": "Ran loses consciousness due to her illness and reminisces about her past with Shinichi in New York. When Ran and Shinichi had touched down in Los Angeles they were told to catch another plane to New York City (NYC) by Shinichi's mother, Yukiko Kudo, who takes the two to view The Golden Apple musical at Broadway. When they arrive, they are introduced to a famous actress named Sharon Vineyard, and the five performers that will be performing the musical. They learn from them that an unknown culprit had sent the performers a Golden Apple with the words \"For the Fairest\" written on it and presume it is a threat. While touring the theater, a medieval suit of armour is sent flying towards the group. An actress is about to be hit with the armor until Ran pushes her out of the way.\nThe performance of The Golden Apple begins. During the climax of the musical, the actor Heath Flockhart, who is portraying Paris, is shot.\n\nThe police arrive and come to the conclusion an unknown assailant rented out all the terraces in the theater and that they shot Heath from there. Shinichi reveals that he found a bullet in one of the terraces shortly after the murder but is was cold meaning it was set up to create the idea an audience murdered Heath. He also reveals that the falling suit if the armor from before was set up by a tripwire deduces that the murderer is one of the four actresses whom all have shared a romantic relationship with Heath. Lilas, Akane, and Rose are Heath's lovers and Iberis was Heath's wife. They kept it a secret, due to their popularity, but Sharon knew and had told Yukiko it. While Shinichi investigates to find out how the murder was done, he notices a crack in the mirror prop and realizes who the murderer is.\nThe police are still suspecting the people who are close to Flockhart at the crime scene. They checked their bodies for gunpowder but still nothing. They confirmed it was an outsider. Suddenly, the lights went off.\n",

    "Resolution": "Shinichi and Ran take a taxi to the hotel but stop in an alleyway when Ran's handkerchief flies out the window and onto a fire escape. Shinichi leaves to retrieve it and Ran meets a man that she almost believes it's a thug or a killer, but is a mysterious FBI agent who orders her to leave as the serial killer they are searching for is nearby. Despite starting to shoy sympthoms of a cold, and thus feeling very dizzy, Ran searches for the missing Shinichi... and finds the (wounded) serial killer on the fire escape. The man prepares to shoot Ran but when the fire escape railing breaks off, he loses his balance but is saved by Ran and Shinichi, who had been this close to catch him few seconds ago. Despite the rescue, the man decides to kill them but Shinichi warns him to stop, since the silencer of the gun he kept in his hand has fallen down from the fire escape, and if he shoots everyone will hear him and he will be soon captured. Ran collapses from her cold and Shinichi carries her away in his arms, declaring to the man that he will capture him the next time they meet. The next day, Yukiko receives a call from Sharon who tells her that she knew Rose was planning something but didn't think it'd be murder, and finishes by asking Yukiko to tell Ran that an angel is watching over her.\n",

The full quote: \"'What the deuce is it to me?' he interrupted impatiently; 'you say that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.'\"\n",
    "Continuity": "- The case in this story is a continuation of the events in the flashback from The Locked Room in the Sky: Shinichi Kudo's First Case.\n- The case in this story is mentioned in the events in the flashback from Shinichi Kudo's Aquarium Case.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- Because of the rearrangement on the airing order, in the anime version, the ending part of this case is included with the scene of Conan (using Shinichi's voice) discussing with Ran about the events back in New York, which should have been the beginning of The Truth of the Haunted House in the original manga series where it takes place right after this case.\n",
    "Remastered version": "- On October 27, 2008, a remastered version of the case was aired. All three episodes were edited and combined into one hour long special, and scenes were edited out to fit the timeslot. However, exclusive to the remastering, new scenes were added to this version. In the beginning, Ran is watching television and sees a reporter talking about New York City, which brings her back to remembering the case from back then. Conan is, for some reason, holding apples, and drops them on the floor. One of those apples turns into a golden apple, and a picture of both Conan and Shinichi is visible. At the end of the case, after Ran blacks out, we can see Ran smiling to herself while remembering Shinichi touching her forehead. Conan asks her why she's smiling, and she answers \"It's. A. Secret!\"\n",
