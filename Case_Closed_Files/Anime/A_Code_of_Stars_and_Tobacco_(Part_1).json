    "Situation": "For an astronomical observation, Conan and the group went to a pension deep inside the mountain. Other than the pension owner, there were also other three people in the pension: the fiancee of the person who invited the three, and the two magazine staff. As they went to the nearby hill to see the stars, they saw decayed bones and underneath a rock nearby, they found a box of cigarettes and a ring which implies he was the missing fiance. That same night, the other man from the magazine staff was killed and left another dying message.\n\n\nAfter Conan, Haibara, Detective Boys, and Professor Agasa realizes that the dying message was referring to Hajime Futagawa's initials and thus making him as the prime suspect, they decided to confront him. But he went missing so as the other suspects. While they were searching at the woods, they later found Futagawa's body on the ground dead. On his hand, another pack of cigarette was found. This time, it contains seven. They also found a cellphone with a will on it, confessing Futagawa's crime and decided to commit suicide. Conan realizes that he didn't commit suicide and the seven cigarette was a clue to the real murderer. So they decided to search to each one's rooms and belongings to find the murder weapon. While looking through the guestbook, Conan finally manage to find out the real culprit behind the murders.\n",
    "People": "- 28 years old\n- Inn guest\n- Kono's girlfriend\n- 34 years old\n- Pension owner\n- Kono's childhood friend\n- Victim (fell)\n- 35 years old\n- Inn guest\n- Space Sunday magazine assistant-editor\n- 43 years old\n- Inn guest\n- Space Sunday magazine editor-in-chief\n- Deceased (fell)\n- Etsuko's boyfriend\n- Astronomer\n- Tottori hot springs' owner\n- Former Jaguars baseball player\n",
    "Resolution": "- The real person who invited the three was proven to be Ryoji Amatsuchi, the pension owner. He did that because he wanted to find the person who murdered Kono, as he already found his bones and belongings before. He also hid the cable to the phone to disable communication, and also deflated the tires to trap everyone at the pension. However, he was not the murderer, as he had a lot of opportunities to destroy the dying message/remove Konno's remains elsewhere.\n- While Etsuko Nonomiya has the most obvious motive to murder Futagawa for his supposed involvement in Konno's death, she was able to provide her alibi during the murder as she was in the forest and saw Conan, Ayumi, and Mitsuhiko rushing toward the cliff, as it is not possible to identify them from the top.\n- With both singled out, it is Heihachi Mikami who murdered both Kono and Futagawa.\n- Futagawa's dying message directly refers to Mikami's given name Heihachi (平八) with 5 long strokes and 2 short strokes.\n- Because Kono didn't know Mikami's given name or the Kanji (御上) used in his surname, he had to rely in the most common spelling of the name Mikami (三上), with 4 long strokes and 2 short strokes, and spelt his dying message that way instead. Futagawa, knowing this ambiguity, added one more long stroke cigarette to make the murderer's identity clearer.\n- Since the weapon, the iron rod-like object, used to incapitate Futagawa was never found at the crime scene, Mikami must still had it in his possession. Conan, noticing that Mikami's telescope is missing a weight, concluded that he must have hidden in his telescope. The luminol test on it will be a solid proof against Mikami.\nMikammi killed Kono because he refused to include his name to the comet that Kono found after asking his help to confirm if it was a new discovery or not. He killed Futagawa after he tried to threatened him that if he didn't pay up 50,000,000, he would surely reveal the crime he committed. Mikami then unveils the weapon he used to incapitate Futagawa, that turned out to be a shotgun.\n\nHe attempts to kill all the inn guests, but is tranquilized by Conan.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Ryoji Amatsuchi SUV at the pension lodging is a 2001 Silver Toyota Rav4 [XA20].\n- Space Sunday, the magazine for which Mikami and Futagawa work for, is a reference to Shōnen Sunday, the magazine that publishes Detective Conan.\n- This case revealed that Haibara can recognized the exact bones of a deceased person, simply based on what the bones look like, even though the bones do not seem to be in the form of a deceased person, so in short, the bones are scattered, and she recognized, \"Mandible, humorus, femur,\"\n- The silver SUV beside Professor Agasa's car has a license plate of 59-59.\n- The professor's car has a 164 license plate.\n- This is the first time that Misao Yamamura mentions his grandmother, who happens to live in the countryside in Tottori.\n- In his home page, Masaharu Motoyama is wrongly \"Masahiro Motoyama\".\n- This is the first episode that does a reference to the Fusae Brand with a Fusae Brand wallet.\n",
