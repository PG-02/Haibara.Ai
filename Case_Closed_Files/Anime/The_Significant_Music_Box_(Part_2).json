    "Situation": "A girl named Haruna Yuki asks Kogoro to search for a man named Shuugo whom she texts with on her pager. She explains that Shuugo sent her a musical box to help pay for her tuition but she could not bring herself to sell something valuable and wants to return it. Conan notices the music box plays the song \"Haru Yo Koi\" (春よ来い, lit. \"Come Dear Spring\") and missed three notes \"La, Do, La\". After tracing the number on the pager, they visit the Ogata family who reveals that Shuugo was an elderly man who had recently died.\n\nThe police had check outside of the house and they were no footprints around the house. Conan investigates and realizes how the pranks were done and who is attempting to scare Haruna away.\n",
    "People": "- 21 years old\n- Art student\n- 50 years old\n- Tsuneo's wife\n- Ogata family first lady\n- 22 years old\n- Ogata family second son\n- Tsuneo and Kazuko's younger son\n- 53 years old\n- Kazuko's husband\n- Current Ogata family head\n- Shuugo and Haruna's son\n- Victim (beaten-injured)\n- 28 years old\n- Ogata family eldest son\n- Tsuneo and Kazuko's eldest son\n- Deceased (illness)\n- Tsuneo's father\n- Haruna's husband\n- Former Ogata family head\n- Deceased\n- Shuugo's wife\n- Tsuneo's mother\n- Former Ogata family first lady\n- Tokyo MPD police officer\n- Tokyo MPD police officer\n",
    "Resolution": "The Ogata family reveals that Shuugo hid stamps worth a fortune somewhere in the house and they suspect Haruna is there to take it from them. They allow Kogoro, Ran, Conan, and Haruna to spend the night at their household. Conan concludes that one of the Ogata family members wants to scare Haruna away.\nAfter tranquilizing Kogoro, Conan reveals that the shadow was created with the use of black paper tapped to a window. When a moving car light flashes through the window, it creates the shadow of a flying figure. As for the Koto, Conan explains that the Koto was suspended through a very long string which was released by the culprit. As evidence, Conan reveals that a hairpin was found at the door where the string was and the one who opened the door was Kazuko Ogata. Kazuko confesses and explains that she did not want Haruna to have the stamps since her family is currently in need of the money. Conan reveals that the missing music notes reveal the location of the stamps. Conan explains that the missing notes in Solfège are La, Do, La, but in Iroha its I-Ha-I which is referring to Spirit tablet (位牌, Ihai?).\nIt was revealed Shiro was the one who left Haruna the music box. Shuugo asked him to do it as well asking him to take care of Haruna once he is in hospital. So since spring he has been sending those messages in Shugo place. Shiro taught his grandfather how to use the pager and he knew’d what Shugo had written to Haruna since his grandfather often talked about it. He tried to tell her everything on Christmas but after seeing her standing their with a red scarf that they’d agreed on as their signal Shiro lost his nerve so he left that shopping bag with the music box and the pager. Shiro didn’t want to go on deceiving Haruna.\n",
    "Trivia": "- After hearing just a few notes, and with some notes being missing, Conan still recognized the melody and notes from Haru yo Koi, a nursery rhyme written by Soma Gyofu and composed by Hirota Ryutaro. The name of the song means \"Come dear Spring\".\n- In this case, when Conan was asked his age by a client, he answered \"about 7\", which is a sign he does not know his physical age at this time, although he is in first grade.\n- The dog's statue is Hachiko's, in Shibuya Park.\n",
