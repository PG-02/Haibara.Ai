    "Situation": "Eri Kisaki is getting her hair done by her barber, Minayo Hasaka, prior to having dinner with Kogoro, Ran, and Conan that evening. Kogoro, who was on his way to pick up Eri, finds a dead body at a garbage collection point.\n\nThe police arrive and Conan reveals that the victim, Shiro Nagasaku, was killed while receiving a hair cut as evidenced by the hair particles found mixed in his blood. Kogoro suspects Hasaka to be the murderer but Eri counters his accusations stating Hasaka only left her sights for a ten minute period during which Hasaka left to throw away the trash at a local convenience store. Eri states that it would be impossible for Hasaka to carry a body to the bottom of a hill during that time period. During the investigation of Hasaka's salon, Conan notices that the back alley of Hasaka's salon is directly above the garbage collection point and the convenience store is in the opposite direction.\nThe police confirm that Hasaka was at the convenience store during the ten minute period. Conan notices that there are strange scratch marks on the pole near the convenience store and the guard rail alley directly above the garbage collection point.\n",
    "People": "- 29 years old\n- Beautician\n- Victim (throat slit)\n- 28 years old\n- Wrestler\n- Convenience store owner\n- Tokyo MPD Police officer\n- Shiro's fiance\n- Model\n- By-stander\n- By-stander\n- By-stander\n",
    "Resolution": "",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- Hasaka is black-haired in the manga.\n- The anime adds a scene in Detective Agency where Ran is asking Kogoro to pick up Eri from salon and the TV news about Nagasaku upcoming marriage at the beginning.\n- In the manga, Nagasaku's corpse is open-eyed. Also, while the police wonders who of his opponents would have had motives for killing him, Hasaka psichotically smiled, believing to never be suspected. In the anime, he's close-eyed and she manifests her psychotic behaviors later on.\n- In the manga it's revealed that Nagasaku and Hasaka were engaged since high school, as well as she has inherited the beauty salon and the scooter from her late father. It's also revealed that she has some assistants, while all of this is never specified in the anime.\n- In the anime, Nagasaku's fiancee is seen with him on the TV and later during Hasaka's confession. In the manga, she's seen only in the latter moment, but with no face.\n- In the manga Hasaka seems far more deranged, blaming Nagasaku's fiancee not only of making him change his hairstyle, but also of making them fight and break their amorous relationship and forcing him to marry her. In the anime she blames the fiancee only of taking him from her while they were on a break and of changing his hairstyle.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is the first episode to use the new art direction and updated character designs by Masatomo Sudo and Junko Yamanaka.\n- This episode marks the introduction of the fifth image at the end of \"Next Episode\" preview. The image features Conan's Glasses and the Voice-Changing Bowtie laying down on a floor, whilst the title is written at the middle of the image.\n- Conan uses a white-colored variant of the Voice-Changing Bowtie, which is his spare one.\n- Minayo Hasaka's motorcycle is a 1996 Honda Dio 50 ZX.\n- New \"Next Conan's hint\" design.\n",
