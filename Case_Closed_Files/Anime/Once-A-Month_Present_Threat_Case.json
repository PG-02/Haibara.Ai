Saying they have paid off 25 million yen, and is going to complete their side of the transaction.\n- The toys did not have barcodes on it, and the fact that some of them were beat up and broken when Ogawa recieved them. Suggested all the toys are at least a few years old.\nCoincidentally, as Conan was playing with one of the toys: a handheld video game system, he discovered that there were save files in the Onimaru video game that was named Tomoya Ogino.\n- Coincidentally, as Conan was playing with one of the toys: a handheld video game system, he discovered that there were save files in the Onimaru video game that was named Tomoya Ogino.\n- Coincidentally, as Conan was playing with one of the toys: a handheld video game system, he discovered that there were save files in the Onimaru video game that was named Tomoya Ogino.\nConan deduced that the presents were not given to Ogawa in gratitude, but with grudge and hate. The toys belonged to Tomoya and the flowers were sent as a memento of the boy. And the meaning of the letter is that they will take the life of Ogawa's son as well.\nAfter calling Ogawa's wife they found out someone else had picked up Yuta instead of her, they rushed out to find him, they eventually did find him in a park near his kindergarten school with an unknown man. It turns out that this man was Tomoya's father, Ogino. Who planned to end Yuta's life on the same day, at the same age that Tomoya died. And paying Ogawa by using Yuta's life insurance money.\n\n- Tomoya's father\n- Deceased (appendicitis)\n- 5 years old (3 years ago)\n- Birth date: January 20th, 1988\n- Ogino's son\nConan was able to stop the murder by using his Power-Enhancing Kick Shoes to kick a nearby soccer ball towards Ogino. And after Ogino seeing Yuta's gratitude for the toys, was reminded of his son causing him to break down and admit that he knows Tomoya's death wasn't really the doctor's fault. Ogawa however forgave Ogino and decided not call the police, citing that, as a father, he understood how devastating it is to lose a son.\n",
