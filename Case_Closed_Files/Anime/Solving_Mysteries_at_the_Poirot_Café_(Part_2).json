    "Situation": "Kazuha and Heiji arrive at the Detective Agency and invite Ran to see Tokyo's Kinza Block 4 lights. Ran has no choice but to accept Kazuha's invitation. Kazuha says she'll help Ran make dinner and the boys go have fun at Poirot café downstairs. Heiji threatens Conan by saying if he's planning to ask why they came, but Conan quickly replies he won't and he already knows most of it. Heiji backs down after Conan said that.\nWhile Kazuha and Ran is still cooking, Conan and Heiji chat about Shinichi's confession to Ran in London. Conan asks Heiji if he is sure about the date if he is really planning to confess to Kazuha since it is Friday the 13th. Amuro interrupts and explains theories of why it's considered an unlucky day. He then consoles Heiji by saying they're in Japan and the 13th day of the month just happened to be Friday. A strange customer interrupts and says tragic events that happened in Europe and today is a very unlucky day.\n\n",

    "Aftermath": "",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- When Heiji and Conan talk about how he confessed his love to Ran in London, Heiji admits that he wants to find a cool line to say to Kazuha when he confesses to her. This was not in the manga.\n- In the anime, after discovering the suspects don't have blood on their hands, Hattori curses to himself and says: \"Why do all these cases have to be so hard?\". This was not in the manga.\n- In the anime, Kogoro sneezes when Conan and Heiji speak about him.\n- In the manga, Takagi tells Inspector Megure that, in a recent case, the culprit had used daikon to make blood disappear. However, due to planning issues, that case was adapted into anime two months after this case was adapted, so the dialogue was cut from the anime version.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The names of the suspects come from theater[1]:\n- Meisuke Ozumi (大積 明輔 ,Ōdzumi Meisuke?) comes from last act (大詰め ,ōdzume?);\n- Yui Yamashita (山下 唯 ,Yamashita Yui?) comes from climax (山場 ,yamaba?);\n- Tengo Anzai (安斉 典悟 ,Anzai Tengo?) comes from blackout (暗転 ,anten?);\n- Minoru Nagatsuka (永塚 稔 ,Nagatsuka Minoru?) comes from \"tsukami\" (掴み), the act of grasping the audience's attention.\n",
