    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "In a lazy Sunday, Conan catches Ran getting out early from home and asks her where is she going. She tells him that she's in a date with Shinichi and Conan at first lets her go. but then realizes that this cannot be true because he is Shinichi. He tries to convince himself that it doesn't matter, but then he decides to tag along anyway.\nRan and Conan are in a restaurant, waiting for \"Shinichi\". She admits that it's not \"Shinichi\" she's waiting for but refuses to say who, only telling him it's \"someone very important\" and then leaving to go get some special cake. Conan stays in their spot and decides to find out on his own by observing the people that will come into the restaurant.\nThe first one to arrive is a woman with glasses and a snippy behavior (Yayoi Himeno), who yells at the maid as she orders coffee. The second one is an uni student (Yuichi Sumeragi) who comes in to work on his thesis. The third is a beautiful lawyer (Eri Kisaki) who sits in the spot next to Conan's, apparently to wait for someone too; she notices Conan and looks at him, which flusters him. The fourth is a huge man with a bandage on his ring finger (Juzo Tonoyama), who doesn't seem to be waiting for anyone and goes straight to the bar. At that point Yayoi gets up and asks where the restroom is, but Conan notices that even when she claims not to know its location, she does know they're mixed restrooms.\nThe fifth person to arrive is a tall, longhaired and cheerful-looking young man (Shiro Wakaoji) who orders coffee, sits down to wait for someone and starts talking on his cellphone, about netting himself a naive and pretty girl and wanting to convince her to have a one-night stand, which horrifies and angers Conan as he believes he wants to take advantage of Ran. Also, as the guy is talking, both the uni student and the pretty lawyer go to the restroom, and soon the big man does likewise.\nWhen Conan is about to \"punish\" Wakaouji, he gets a call from Ran in the restaurant's public phone. She tells him she'll be late since there's a mess in the pastry shop, right as Conan's 'target' is going to the restroom too. Then a scream is heard, and Conan rushes there to see a terrified Wakaoji yelling about a huge blood stain coming from inside one of the stalls. Conan gets in and uses his powered shoes to check over the door, and sees Yayoi's lifeless body inside there.\n\nMegure and other policemen arrive to investigate Yayoi's brutal murder, done by both stranglement and stabbing. Megure believes she was first stabbed, as everything's blood-splattered and that would've not happened if she was strangled first. He also thinks it was a robbery, since the crime scene is way too messy and the killer/robber likely was inside the stall; however, Conan says that the window in the stall wall is too clean for that.\nBefore Megure can contradict Conan's observation, Eri supports Conan's statement, and it turns out they've known each other from before. But when Megure's gonna say where he knows Eri from, she starts making her own theories about the case, which ultimately guides her and Conan to find out which of the other persons who went into the bathroom is Yayoi's killer.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (stabbed)\n- 24 years old\n- Part-time worker\n- 25 years old\n- Graduate student\n- 37 years old\n- Lawyer\n- 38 years old\n- College rugby team coach\n- 21 years old\n- AD agency employee\n- Cafe Royal owner\n- Tonoyama's friend\n- Shiro's friend\n- Cukiernia Tanaka owner\n",
    "Resolution": "\nIn his anger upon being discovered, Tonoyama tries to escape and attacks Eri. However, she easily uses a judo throw to pin him down, which allows the police to catch him. The particular judo move she used is something that Conan had seen before. He's then taken away by the police, screaming everything is Eri's fault.\nThe reason for Tonoyama's murder of Yayoi was that she was \"the other woman\" in his marriage. She didn't know that Tonoyama was a married man so she angrily started to demand for a wedding (probably not helped by how she was almost 25 years old, nearing the age where an unmarried woman is known as a christmas cake and is looked down on by the still conservative Japanese society), and he decided to kill her before his wife found out.\nAfter that, the police 'cord' is dismantled and Ran finally arrives. Conan uses his child-like looks to try forcing Wakaoji to reveal that he wanted to have sex with the girl he's been waiting for, thinking said girl is Ran. To his surprise, it isn't Ran, but it is someone they know: Sonoko, who angrily calls him out and slaps him before leaving. Conan is confused, and then Ran meets up with Eri. She lectures Ran on her too short miniskirt and Ran calls her \"mom\", sending Conan into a shock.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga, Conan just woke up and is still in his pyjamas when he catches Ran sneaking out.  This also explains why he doesn't see through her lie about going to a date with Shinichi immediately. In the anime, Conan shows no signs of having been asleep and wears a normal outfit.\n- In the manga, when Shiro Wakaoji calls and talks about the girl wearing a ski costume, Conan thinks it refers to Alpine Hut in the Snowy Mountain Murder Case, but in the anime he mentioned a girl from TV Station Murder Case. The Alpine Hut in the Snowy Mountain Murder Case took place after many episodes. Either way, Sonoko who was Shiro Wakaoji actual date, isn't on those episodes.\n",

    "Trivia": "- People's surnames have kanji associated with Japanese Royalty: Yayoi Himeno as Princess, Yuichi Sumeragi as Emperor, Juzo Tonoyama as Feudal Lord, Eri Kisaki as Queen, and Shiro Wakaoji as Prince.\n"
