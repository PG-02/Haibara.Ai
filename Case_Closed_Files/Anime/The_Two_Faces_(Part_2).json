Later, Masako hands over Issei's wallet found by the police to Kogoro, and using the receipt inside the wallet, Conan found out a place where Issei might be. It turns out to be a second-hand factory owned by Issei. When they finds Issei, he scares and says that he lied to his wife because he wasn't a company president, but a factory owner.
