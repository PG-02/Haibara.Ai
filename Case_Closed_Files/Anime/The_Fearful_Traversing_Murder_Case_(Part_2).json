    "Situation": "Several years ago, the Fox known as the best assassin in the country had killed a president of a major company. However this assassination took place while his target was driving as a result, his car swerved into the path of a school bus carrying elementary school children. This caused a collision, that claimed the life of the young 5 year old Chisato Ushio, due to this unintended casualty The Fox went into hiding.\nIn the present, Kogoro is hired to capture the Fox, the client being Ushio Bunzo, a millionaire who once hired the Fox to kill him since he was supposedly about to die. But he found out from his doctor that he would live to see another day, as a result he wanted to back off the deal but he had no way of contacting the Fox, instead he wants to have the Fox captured.\nBunzo asks Kogoro to follow him alongside Ran and Conan in a hiking trip that the Fox is supposed to attend as well. Kogoro is about to decline when suddenly Conan notices a glint that is coming a sniper (apparently The Fox) who is aiming at them from a nearby rooftop. Conan manages to push him out of the way and save him, after firing wildly into the office the shooter leaves. Kogoro is relieved but at the same time distressed about his windows, Bunzo offers to pay him for damages as long as he helps him and he accepts.\nAfter arriving at the entrance of the hiking trail, Kogoro along with Conan and Ran act like they are meeting Bunzo for the first time while meeting the others hikers who are: Wataru Takanashi, Shingo Nose, Kyoko Saegusa, Akira Kawabe and their guide Kenichi Hirai. They keep a close eye on these people as they believe one of them is the infamous Fox.\nThey then follow their guide Hirai through the hiking trail, along the way Bunzo  nearly falls down a deep ravine after almost tripping off a cliff. Bunzo believes that Hirai tried to kill him but quickly calms down after Kogoro talks to him. Afterwards they decide to take a break and rest before they start to hike again, while Hirai leaves to check out their current location.\n\n\n\n\nRan and Conan discuss who The Fox could be as there are many suspicious individuals among them. Suddenly they hear a scream and check to see where it came from, they find Wataru Takanashi who directs them towards Hirai's body who apparently fell off the cliff. When Kogoro accuses Takanashi of murdering Hirai he suddenly panics and asks to be let go, leaving the others stunned and confused.\nConan and Kogoro climb down and examine Hirai's body where they find that he landed on the back of his head on a rock. However Conan notices that Hirai has a gash on his cheek and a knife nearby with some blood on it. Meaning someone threw this knife at him and although Hirai managed to barely dodge it while sustaining a cut on his face, he lost his balance and fell to his death. Conan and Kogoro both wonder if the killer who they believe to be The Fox is among them.\nAfterwards they make it to a cabin and meet the caretaker there, whose name is Juukichi Iwata an elderly man that startles them. He invites them in and prepares food for them, and learns from them that one of their members was killed and he comments that it was most likely no accident. Later the group discuss who the murderer could be and Takanashi is labeled the criminal. He then suddenly pulls out his large hunting knife and throws it near one of the members of the group then re-holsters it.\nDuring this exchange Bunzo accidentally reveals Kogoro real name and identity to the other members. One of them recognizes Kogoro as the famous Sleeping Kogoro which startles the couple Akira and Kyoko, who Conan deems suspicious.\n\nWhile they are sleeping an unknown person approaches Kogoro and plunges their knife into the pillow which startles Kogoro enough to wake him up. Bunzo, Kogoro, and Conan give chase after believing that Takanashi is the culprit. They track him down after hearing him screaming, and learn that he is actually Claustrophobic explaining his strange demeanor and attitude. While traveling back to the cabin Takanashi explains why he became claustrophobic in the first place.\nWhen they are near the cabin, they suddenly hear Ran screaming, and fearing the worst rush towards the cabin.\nThe others rush to the cabin and are relieved to see Ran unharmed, she apologizes saying that there is trouble and directs them toward Kyoko Saegusa who is dead with a knife in her back. Akira Kawabe is mourning her death apologizing for not being able to protect her. Shingo Nose asks what is going on, as it is obvious that Kogoro knows more then he’s letting on.\nKogoro decides to tell them the truth, he reveals that he came to the hiking trip to hunt the infamous assassin The Fox. Although Bunzo chastises Kogoro for revealing the truth, he justifies this saying that two of their members are dead enough is enough. However as they are talking Shingo reveals himself to be right handed just like The Fox. Kogoro believes and deduces that Shingo is The Fox but he laughs this off saying that he is wrong.\nBut Kogoro doesn't believe him stating that he is the only one capable and he is also right handed just like The Fox. Bunzo believing this grabs Shingo stating that he has business with him. Conan investigates and figures out that the one who stabbed Kyoko was her lover Akira Kawabe, as they were hugging he looped one of his arms around her back and stabbed her with a knife. Ran demonstrates this together with Conan.\n\nConan also finds Kyoko's backpack filled with bundles of cash, with some of them stained with blood. Just then Takanashi tells them that two of their members are missing: the caretaker Junnichi and Akira. A landslide occurs and they hear screaming nearby, so Conan, Ran, and Kogoro go to check it out. They find Akira and help him to safety, he tells them that he took the caretaker hostage but he ran off as soon as the landslide occurred.\nConan and the others return back to the cabin and learn that Bunzo left to help as well but hasn't returned. Kogoro is confident believing they have captured The Fox who he believes is Akira Kawabe, however he denies this saying that he hasn’t killed anyone. But Conan looks through Akira's bag and finds more bundles of cash with blood on them, Kogoro tries to get Akira to tell them where that bloody money came from but he remains silent.\nJust then Takanashi tells them that he has managed to fix the radio and as a result the following news report airs: \"The police are still searching for the suspects who have killed and robbed a rich man in his home, the suspects are said to be a man and woman in hiking clothes\". As they listen Kogoro notices Akira panicking and puts two and two together realizing that Akira and Kyoko are the robbery-murderers on the run.\nAkira seeing that he has been cornered admits being one of two suspects the police are looking for in the robbery-murder case. He also admits to killing Kyoko after learning that Kogoro was a famous detective and believing he was looking for them. Kyoko had wanted them to turn themselves in having enough of being a fugitive, however Akira refused saying they still had a chance to escape.\nBut Kyoko still insisted on turning themselves in, Akira pretending to agree hugged Kyoko and then stabbed her in the back just the way Conan had deduced. Akira said it was Kogoro's fault for Kyoko having to die, because he had hid the true reason for him being there scaring them unnecessarily. The group then sees that the caretaker has a phone and fax with him and it uses a landline meaning they have a chance of calling for help.\nBut when Kogoro tries to use the phone, he hears no dial tone. Conan wondering why suddenly sees the landline cable has been severed via a knife. Conan then deduces that the caretaker Iwata is in fact The Fox, the assassin they came for. Conan believes that the fake caretaker also killed their guide because he could've figured out that he was a fake, as he and the real caretaker have been acquaintances for quite some time.\nConan also realizes that Bunzo is after The Fox because of his own vendetta and goes to find him.\n",

    "Resolution": "The Fox was disguised as Juukichi Iwata, the cottage caretaker, and Hirai was killed because he regularly traversed and knew the real Iwata, so he was a potential spanner in the Fox's plans. At the same time, Saegusa's death was a completely unrelated incident; Kawabe killed her to silence her after they both committed a robbery-murder.\n\n\n\n\n\nBunzo figured out that Iwata was The Fox, after witnessing Iwata pushing Akira down the cliff during the landslide and running off despite the fact that he was a old man. This made Bunzo realize who his adversary was and that he had to kill him. Bunzo also reveals that the sniper who fired into Kogoro's office was in fact a friend of his who owed him a favor, he had asked his friend to shoot into the office to scare Kogoro into helping him.\nBunzo manages to confront \"Iwata\" aka the Fox, furiously calling him out for Chisato's death. Conan stops Bunzo by showing him the picture of Chisato that he kept in his wallet and begging him to not taint his hands, seeing this and remembering his daughter he decides to drop the gun. Which is then picked up by The Fox who tries to kill them, but Conan kicks the gun out of his hands via his super kick shoes.\nThe Fox tries to flee but is intercepted by Kogoro who judo throws him, in the process The Fox is revealed to have been wearing a disguise and was actually a lot younger then he appeared to be.\n",
