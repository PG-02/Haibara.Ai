    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Sonoko went to Kanagawa to try out some French gourmet food in a restaurant called Déesse du Vent. The first intent of them going here was because Kogoro saw Yoko had come here before in one of her drama. Therefore it was rather popular and had a two-year waiting list of reservations; so how did they manage to go there instantly? The answer was obviously Sonoko - but as well as the fact that the head chef of that restaurant was a fan of the Sleeping Kogoro. Supposedly, they had also called the Detective Boys and Agasa to tag along. Unfortunately, Haibara got fairly afraid concerning the past incidents (The Time Capsule Case and FBI Serial Murder Case), in which she was on the brink of the exposure of her identity, so she decided to stay out this time, the other kids thus accompanied her in Professor's house and altogether they ate Subaru Okiya's curry. On Conan's end, he was still with Agasa inside the car, lost in orientation since Kanagawa was quite strange for them. Agasa was also caught for overspeeding in the middle of the road by a female traffic cop, who has a lock of red-brown long hair, wearing the police uniform and helmet. When they finally arrived there, Agasa and Conan explained the situation and the reason for there lateness. After that, they met a stout and strong old man, apparently having similar ages with Professor Agasa, who claimed himself as Kinji Nanjou, the Suzuki Security representative director. he greeted Sonoko and went to the bathroom; Agasa, on the other hand, also intended to go to the bathroom.\nWithin the bathroom, President Nanjo and Professor Agasa were both washing their hands. They found out that they looked somewhat alike to each other, President Nanjo therefore entrusted Agasa with a little affair, which was to swap their clothes to impersonate each other. President Nanjo in fact wanted to sneak out of the restaurant before his family arrived, so he wanted to fool his guards so they would mistake Agasa for himself, so he could run away. The most dramatic consequence of this was that it did not fool the two guards of his, but instead, it fooled two criminals who were inside the restaurant precisely. A man with a long face, short hair, and a vicious-look hijacked Agasa with a gun and took him to the garage forcefully, along with his accomplice.\n\nJust as Conan was puzzling about it, wondering why he saw \"two President Nanjos\" outside the bathroom, a sharp sound of gunfire burst in. By judging the establishment point of this gunfire, Conan pursuited and got to the garage. Conan then found a drop of the professor's fresh blood on the ground, and he understood what was going on with Agasa, so he activated his glasses to track the location of Agasa since he had a detective badge with him. He then urged Kogoro and Ran to inform the police, and he had stepped onto his skateboard and gone straight towards the highway. He then used the detective badge to communicate with the professor. Agasa said that evidently there were two criminals involved in this abduction case; the first was the man, who pointed at him with the gun initially; the second was a woman, who was driving the car. Conan also got the indication that the car in which Agasa was kidnapped was a yellow one. Conan afterwards found the car and noticed some stains of blood on the truck, so it was assumed that Agasa was inside.\nThe woman who was driving the car attempted to ditch Conan by insanely turning the steering wheel, which bounced Conan midst the sky. At that instance, Conan was swinging in the hollow sky, and his helplessness has genuinely manifested. Kogoro and Ran, who were driving behind, also witnessed that, and they were utterly shocked. Suddenly, the traffic cop who intercepted Agasa earlier grabbed Conan in the middle of the sky with her motorcycle and saved him timely. Ran felt that the traffic cop had grown a pair of angel wings, which lingered back and forth. \"Thud...\" The motorcycle landed on the road, Conan was successfully saved by the traffic cop, who seemingly had \"wings\" on her back. She took off the police helmet and actually introduced herself properly to everyone: her name is Chihaya Hagiwara, who is from the Kanagawa Police Traffic Division. Hagiwara then analysed the situation: Professor Agasa was kidnapped due to his similar appearances with President Nanjo, who was the real target of the two criminals. President Nanjo once bragged about how good his safes were by saying \"No one is able to open it unless it's him; then go and steal me as well\", which somewhat provoked the robbery thieves, so the two criminals here might have robbed one of these safes and wanted to rob President Nanjo as well in order to open his safe.\n\nHagiwara wanted to after the two criminals with Conan, since Conan had the location tracking glasses to know the exact location and the detective badge to communicate with Agasa directly. However, one of the criminals noticed that their hostage might have some sort of GPS technology on him apart from his phone, which they had gotten rid of in the first place. So they re-examined the truck and tossed the detective badge out of the car. At the same time, they also changed the car licence to minimize the probability of being discovered. Hagiwara felt quite discouraged, since now they could not know the location of that yellow car anymore and also that it would be impossible to intercept it with a different car license. Conan then told her that \"there's another way; there's no need to give up yet\". By means of this remark by Conan, Hagiwara got reminded by her younger brother, Kenji Hagiwara, who obviously said the same sentence before.\nOn the other hand, Kogoro, Ran, and Sonoko returned to the garage of that French restaurant; they were discussing the case as well. Kogoro found out that the criminals did not make a reservation to go to this restaurant; they just knocked down two random people in the garage and pretended to be them. President Nanjo also leaked his schedule for today, so they got here easily. The two people were clearly knocked unconscious by stun gun, just like what they did with Professor Agasa when they tossed his detective badge.\n\nAfterwards, the Kanagawa Prefecture police showed up; it was the familiar Jugo Yokomizo; he also commented on the Mouri family as the \"family of reapers\" in a playful tone. Later on, he quickly targeted the two criminals' identities; the woman was named Rokue Chien, and the man was named Daiya Chien. Ran then told him that Conan went along with a female traffic cop who possessed long red hair to persuade the criminals, and Inspector Yokomizo was fairly concerned about Hagiwara...\nWhile riding on Chihaya's motorcycle, Conan skillfully identified the rough location of the two criminals; by using the tapping device installed on Professor's glasses, he was able to hear the persistent sound of fire trucks, which made them target the exact location instantly. Hence, Chihaya demanded a checkpoint along the path that the kidnappers were planning to take. On most occasions, it would work and intercept the culprits right away; however, after they consulted the police at the checkpoint, they got the information that no yellow cars with the same model as the kidnappers had passed through. And supposedly it could be the only way for them to escape, and if they turned backwards, Conan and Chihaya, who were riding the motorcycle at the back, would notice them as well. After some time, the police received the information that when they were doing the car examination, they heard that there were some people buying a lot of bottles of hot tea from a nearby convenience store. Apart from the 20 bottles of hot tea, they also bought a blue-grey umbrella. Conan was then able to deduce that the people the police were mentioning must be the two kidnappers, since he also heard a chime of the convenience store door in the tapping device.\nConan eventually understood how the two criminals could pass over the checkpoint without noticing, and the truth was...\n",

    "Resolution": "",
    "A Trick Involving Hot Tea and Umbrella": "The trick behind the transformation of their yellow car was that they smeared thermochratic paint onto the surface of their car; a chemical reaction will take place with the paint when the temperature exceeds 30 degrees - This causes their car to change color from yellow to grey. The umbrella was used to cover up the behavior of \"pouring hot tea onto the car\", and not expose the trick to the public. So people would just assume they were solely washing their cars.\n",
    "The Threatened Life of Professor": "Just as Conan and Chihaya wanted to capture the kidnappers and thought everything would go well, a photo of President Nanjou was published online. This made Conan feel worried, as if the culprits saw that photo, they would know that they had kidnapped the wrong person, and Agasa has a very high possibility of being silenced and ditched somewhere along with the car. So they speed up after the kidnappers.\nOn the other side, Kogoro, Ran, and Inspector Yokomizo were driving in a police car, following Chihaya. Yokomizo then said that Chihaya actually had met with Conan before; he then mentioned the Toto Tower bombing case and claimed that the casualty from that case, Kenji Hagiwara, was Chihaya's younger brother. And since Conan had stopped the bomb, he appeared very often on TV. Chihaya always said that if she could meet with Conan for once, she would definitely repay him for avenging his brother. That was the reason Yokomizo looked very worried when he learned that Chihaya was with Conan on the motorcycle.\nFinally, Chiahya and Conan found the kidnappers' car and followed behind, but the male criminal did not back down; he took out his gun and started shooting bullets towards Chihaya, which enraged her. She pressed the accelerator gear, hovered her motorcycle in the air, and made a perfect 360-degree spin that suppressed her motorcycle wheel onto the male criminal's face. Eventually, both of them were captured.\n",
    "Aftermath": "Agasa was taken away in an ambulance in the end; he had no life danger, though he was still unconscious.\nHowever, Yokomizo criticized Chihaya for performing stoppies and wheelies on public roads while carrying a kid on the motorcycle and flipping the front wheel into a person's face. But Chihaya said she does not owe any favor to Yokomizo if he covers it all up for her, as she could consider accepting the dinner date requested by Yokomizo, which was turned down by her.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- The anime add some scene:\n- Agasa ask Conan if he found something matter after Chihaya salutes him.\n- Sonoko asking first about the men accompanying Nanjo.\n- A big screen announcing the news that Nanjo is with the police.\n- Jugo tell Kogoro to put on the sirene after hearing about the kidnappers' position.\n- Ran, Sonoko, and Jugo reacting to Chihaya doing stoppie.\n- Some dialogues changes:\n- Chihaya specified the fine Agasa got in the manga, while in the anime she only scold and warn him.\n- Because Sonoko ask about the men accompany Nanjo first in the anime, Nanjo only says that those men are bodyguards. In the manga, he said that without being asked and thought that the bodyguards are a bit much.\n- In the manga, Agasa knew the car model, and the car is white. In the anime, Agasa doesn't know the car model and the car is yellow.\n- In the manga, Kogoro's rental car is a Nissan Sentra, while in the anime, it is his usual Toyota Crown.\n",
