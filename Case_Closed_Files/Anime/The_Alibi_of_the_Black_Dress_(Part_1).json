Ten minutes later, a woman named Yuika Shodo, arrives to the tea house where they learn that she was suppose to meet with the woman from before. The four then leave to go shopping. On the way, a pair of thieves tries to steal their shopping bags by spilling ice cream on Ran and Sonoko but are foiled by Conan. The girls are forced to change in a public restroom where they find the gothic girl from before dead.\n\nThe cellphone of the gothic girl, revealed to be Mihiro Kuze, has been ringing every ten minutes for the past two hours and on the phone is Shodo. The police confirm with the waitress at the tea house that Kuze and Shodo arrived ten minutes apart and with the public restroom thirty minutes away, it removes Shodo as a suspect. Conan however reveals that the gothic girl that entered the restaurant may not have been Kuze since the gothic lolita fashion distracts them from her face.\nThe police investigate the glass the gothic girl was drinking which holds Kuze's fingerprints.
