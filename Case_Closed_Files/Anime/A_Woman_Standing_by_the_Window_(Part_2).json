    "Part 1": "One day, as Ayumi runs in the street, she hurts herself when she falls so a lady walking nearby, Saki Midorikawa, goes to help her and bring her home in her apartment to heal her and offers her orange juice. Ayumi thought she was nice. Saki then went to the window to smoke and look over the building in front of hers.\n\n\n\n",
    "Part 2": "The next day, the Detective Boys head to the crime scene and meet Megure, Takagi, and Chiba who are intrigued by their presence. They also meet Naka Nakabayashi, who tells them she witnessed Saki being pushed by someone the day before but that she didn't know who it was and that she's had enough of crimes before leaving the scene. They also see Towa Akabane, who lives in room 202, who just returned from a trip and that sees the crime scene too before heading to her room in disgust. Tatsuko Dojima, who witnessed Saki falling asks the police to leave since she's exhausted and returns home. Tachibana and Konno also head home after visiting the crime scene thinking Midorikawa committed suicide. The Detective Boys explain the situation to the police and tell them she was most likely murdered and that there are three suspicious people who looked highly towards her. Megure agrees to visit the three to interrogate them and Ogi opens the automatic door for them. At Tachibana's room, they interrogate him to find out he received a threathening letter from Saki about not telling anything to the police which rises the police's suspicions before Tachibana reveals he's in fact bald and that he hides it under a wig. He tells he has an alibi since he was at the bar at the time the attempted murder was committed and that when he took off his wig in front of the bay window, Saki saw his bald head and sent him the letter the next day. Second suspect was Michiyo Konno who reveals to the police she's in fact a man named Daihachi Numagaki and that to avoid being arrested for murder, he'll reveal his criminal acts. He is the one who pushed her in the street but he didn't kill her and that Saki has seen him as a man through his window while he was drinking beer and taking off his disguise. He wanted to scare her so he pushed her to hide the fact he was pretending to be Michiyo Konno and that he was frauding the trading firm. He is arrested by the police for attempted murder and fraud and says he was at home when she was killed and that he also received the letter. He replies negatively as the police ask him if he drugged her before pushing her since sleeping pills were found in her body and tells that he didn't drug her. Genta then agrees that he must be the culprit but Conan wonders about the letter and the phone call. Ayumi adds that Saki must have seen the culprit's secrets while she was over since after all she said: \"So, they seem to have a friend over!\". Conan asks what friend it might be and Mitsuhiko thinks that maybe Saki thought Daihachi was someone else since he was dressed in a different way. At the same time, a police car comes and Towa Akabane heads out of the building running towards the cops and yeling that she's the one from room 202 who called for the police and that she was robbed while she was travelling and that all her jewels were gone when she returned. Conan remebers the lady passing in front of the crime scene and thinks about the friend Saki mentionned which make him deduce something and he runs to Saki's apartment with the rest of the Detective Boys behind.\n\n\nWhen they arrived to the apartment, Hiroe Omori, the landlady, led them in with Takagi also. From the balcony of Saki's room in her apartment, Conan notices he can see all the apartments of the residential building ending with \"2\" and sees Akabane in her room talking with the police. The Detective Boys then conclude Saki must have seen the thief of Akabane since she doesn't work in the morning. Haibara notices the apartment is rather simple for someone blackmailing people and Ayumi sees a picture frame with someone holding Saki, probably her boyfriend. They learn from the landlady that the boyfriend left Saki three years ago because he couldn't leave out of his debts and left them to Saki. Conan realizes she started blackmailing people because she wanted to pay off her boyfriend's debts and that was why she lived rather modestly. Omori also says that Saki always believed her boyfriend would return to her someday and believed in him. She started to sit in the window so she'll be there to see him come back and always look everywhere around to see him return one day. Conan asks Omori if she had told anyone else and she says she had told a female detective about it last night and that that detective asked her to tell her all about it since her investigation about Saki was important. Conan then realizes who killed Saki and asks Takagi to return to the building so he'll expose the truth.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (fell)\n- 28 years old\n- Night club cabaret dancer\n- 43 years old\n- TV show commentator\n- Social critic\n- 33 years old\n- Beika Women's University professor\n- 24 years old\n- Trading firm office worker\n- 58 years old\n- Apartment building manager\n- 73 years old\n- Retired\n- Victim (robbed)\n- 26 years old\n- Rich traveller\n- 32 years old\n- Scammer\n- Unemployed\n- 60 years old\n- Saki's apartment building landlady\n- Saki's boyfriend from three years ago\n",
    "Resolution": "- First, Tatsuko send blackmail letters to Junnosuke Tachibana and Michiyo Konno in order to increase potential suspects for the crime, and to incite one of them into murdering Saki for her, which Numagaki fell for. However, he failed, forcing Tatsuko to take the matter into her own hands.\n- Tatsuko lured Saki to her room, pretending to have information about Saki's boyfriend. She then drugged her, placing her on the table on the balcony with ice blocks under it. Once the ice melted, the table will tilt and cause Saki to fall down to her doom. Gloves were planted to cause the police to think that the crime scene was the rooftop, and to provide reason why Saki's fingerprints were not found. Because she has an alibi during the time that Saki fell, Tatsuko would be excluded from the list of suspects by the police.\n- Unfortunately for Tatsuko's, one of the weather balloons on the balcony was torn apart from the hanger and scratched Saki's neck fell, which provides a connection between her and the victim. Additionally, because Tatsuko is very confident about her trick, she is unlikely to have disposed all the incriminating evidences of the crime in her room, which are sure to be found once the police begin their search.\n",
