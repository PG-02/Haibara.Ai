    "Situation": "While at the Agasa's, Conan recalls his last meeting with the Black Organization. Conan deduces that another Black Organization member must have been at the hotel party. This is when he finally singles out Chris Vineyard as his suspect. Heiji came to Tokyo to help Conan out with the case. Heiji suspects Jodie-sensei of being a possible Black Organization member, and although Conan seems reluctant to this idea, they pay Jodie-sensei a visit at her apartment. They find out here that her full name is \"Jodie Saintemillion\". After Jodie agrees to go out for a while with Heiji and Conan, the man living next door to Jodie falls dead outside from over 30 stories, coincidentally as the three are outside.\n\nAfter the police arrive, it seems likely that the man committed suicide. However, Conan and Heiji have a different idea.\nHeiji immediately destroys the theory of suicide, by showing that the man who fell from his apartment attempted to grab onto the curtain to save his life. Then he gets an angry call from Kazuha, who is mad that he hasn't met up with her for dinner.\n",
    "People": "- 30 years old\n- Company employee\n- 28 years old\n- Company employee\n- 33 years old\n- Company employee\n- Victim (fell)\n- Company employee\n- Deceased (suicide)\n- 30 years old\n- Company employee\n",

    "Manga to anime changes": "- Jodie Starling's copies of the pictures of Ran and Conan on Vermouth's dartboard have irregular borders indicating they were photographs of Vermouth's pictures. This important clue that Jodie was not Vermouth was overlooked by the anime which drew the edges evenly. The anime version also removed the word \"Angel\" from Ran's photo. The cursive \"cool guy\" on Conan's photo was accidentally written in the anime as \"cool gay\", probably because the animators were not used to English cursive. Another evidence showing that Jodie was investigating Doctor Araide was also altered in the anime adaptation. While the person standing in front of Sonoko was drawn with brown hair and glasses in the manga, the animators totally omitted the glasses and colored his hair black, which might give the watchers a wrong impression that the person was Shinichi, who also participated in the school drama with those students. Open spoiler box to see images.\n",
    "Continuity": "- This is the case where Conan tells Professor Agasa \"That the police records of all of Detective Mouri's solved cases have been stolen from the metropolitan police headquarters,\" which links this episode to The Forgotten Memento from the Crime case, when Detective Takagi told Conan that information.\nConan also told Agasa that \"whoever stole the files was gracious enough to return them to the police,\" which Takagi also told Conan about.\n- Conan also told Agasa that \"whoever stole the files was gracious enough to return them to the police,\" which Takagi also told Conan about.\n- Conan also brings up the Haido City Hotel incident, which took place in Reunion with the Black Organization, to Professor Agasa and Heiji Hattori.\n- Conan also told Agasa that \"whoever stole the files was gracious enough to return them to the police,\" which Takagi also told Conan about.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The victim's name in this case means high in Japanese, which makes his cause of death ironic.\n",
