    "Situation": "When a fan of Kogoro, who works as a famous potter, invites the Mouri family out to his place for the weekend, Kogoro wins an valuable cup of pottery. After a long night of drinking, the group awakes and finds that a suicide has taken place. Inspector Megure thinks it may be more than a coincidence, but what is the real truth behind this mystery?\n\nDespite most proof pointing to a suicide, Conan is convinced that a murder has taken place. He begins looking for additional proof that someone killed Masuko.\n",
    "People": "- 78 years old\n- Birth name: Mankichi Tsuchiya\n- Ceramic artist\n- Victim (hanged)\n- 42 years old\n- Kikuemon's late son's wife\n- 36 years old\n- Kikuemon's apprentice\n- 35 years old\n- Kikuemon's apprentice\n- 36 years old\n- Kikuemon's apprentice\n",

    "Anime": "- The names of the characters in the Funimation Dub are:\n- Kikuemon (Birth name, Mankichi Tsuchiya) - Forgemaster (Birth name, Stygas Wafulcot)\n- Masuko Tsuchiya - Margery Wafulcot\n- Yoshihiko Arita - Artie Stonewall\n- Ryuichi Seto - Sammy Hammerstoltz\n- Kaoru Otani - Otto\n",
    "Trivia": "- During the party, Kogoro is asked to tell his deductions on some of the cases he solved. He was asked to tell how he solved Tsukikage Island case and Kiritengu case which Conan solved while as he was asleep, so he avoids telling those stories. He insists on telling the reunion case which he partially solved and was not put asleep. But he had already told them that story. He also had already told them about museum case and magician case which he also partially solved and was not put asleep.\n- Conan notes that these are the only three cases that were solved while he was awake.\n- However, this is not true if TV original episodes are taken into consideration. In The Mystery Weapon Murder Case, the case was also partially solved by Kogoro and he was not put asleep, so he could have told that story during the party.\n- In the manga Japanese version, the hiragana ideograms on Kaoru's surname meaning \"Ooya\" and not \"Otani\".\n- The name of Kikuemon is passed down from one treasure national pottery master onto his successor, and the trend continues. The current Kikuemon is the fifth or 6th one, and he had 3 apprentices, which one is expected to inherit the name after he passes on or retires. Kikuemon seems to be inspired from the world famous potter Raku Kichizaemon, famous for the Raku ware, a type of ceramics used in tea. Raku Kichizaemon is also a hereditary title passed down from generation to generation.\n",
