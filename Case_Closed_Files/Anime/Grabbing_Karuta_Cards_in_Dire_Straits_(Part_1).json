    "Situation": "Waking up with a fever, Conan reluctantly stays in bed while Haibara and the Detective Boys begin to play Karuta Cards. Mitsuhiko video calls to check why Conan is not with them. Suddenly, the door bell and repetitive knocks are at the front of Ayumi's apartment. A strange boy with slanted eyes, widow's peak, and glasses stands panting and begging for help. \"Naturally,\" his \"parents\" come and pick him up from the door step and tell the detective boys it was only a prank and not to worry about it. Still video chatting, Conan explains that it was not a prank and that they should call Takagi. Conan hangs up and rest in bed. The Detective Boys are debating whether to listen to Conan or not because of his cold. In the end, Haibara and the Detective Boys walk around the building and ask the neighbors about the Urafune family. But all it leads up to going to the condo itself.\n\nTo come up with an excuse, Haibara says that they want to play with Masao, and push their way in to the apartment. Genta needs to use the restroom but it seems to be occupied, so Masao's \"mom\" tells him that he can use the back one. Slowly the Karuta game progresses, and so does the atmosphere in the room.\nBy the time Masao picks his card, Genta just so happens to want the same one, nevertheless Masao is completely reluctant to give his card away. While the Detective Boys find that strange, Haibara takes notes on his behavior of their new companion. And as the game continues, the \"Mother\" reads the cards aloud reluctantly. With the cards gathered and in place Masao says, \"Mommy, restroom!\" She replies, \"It cant be helped. I'll go with you.\" Leaving his final clue, Masao says, \"Bring my towel! I can't go without it! You know, the towel (ta o ru) with a horsehair crab (Ke ga ni) from Lake Suwa (su wa ko)!\"\n",
    "People": "- Victim (kidnapped)\n- Boy\n- Kidnapper\n- Masao's \"father\"\n- Kidnapper\n- Masao's \"mother\"\n- Victim (kidnapped)\n- Masao's mother\n- Condo resident\n- Condo resident\n- Hates Masao\n- Takagi in disguise\n- Deceased (car accident)\n- Nichiuri TV producer\n",
    "Resolution": "Unfortunately, little do they know that there is a cell phone that is listing to their every word that the \"mom\" left behind. Masao's fake parents congratulate the kids for figuring most of it out, then brutally tell them that they stop there.\nSuddenly, a postman rings the bell and tells them that he need to bring up a package, the adults agree and tell the kids to hush. When the door opens, they hear a struggle and a fall. Masao's fake dad then walks over to the door, only to being hit with a soccer ball. Takagi, who disguised as the postman, takes orders from Conan, who had deduced the circumstances of the whole situation.\nConan knew right away that the couple with Masao were not his biological parents because Masao had a widows peak, a triangular piece of hair in the middle of the forehead while the two did not which is not genetically possible. He found it suspicious that the couple had been acting like his biological parents when they were not.\n",
    "Motive": "The two kidnappers, were trying to destroy evidence pertaining to tax evasion. The sender of that registered mail was the previous resident of Masao's apartment. The one named Uemura, who was a former employee of the Isobe Corporation, now is under suspicion of tax evasion. The contents of the registered mail were probably whistleblower documents, or account books with evidence of tax evasion. The documents were sent not too long ago to the producer at Nichiuri TV, Hida. The employee planned to move and go into hiding. But Hida ended up in a coma due to a car accident, and couldn't receive the registered mail as he was hospitalized. Since the post office holds on to the mail for more or less than ten days, the kidnappers calculated the time of its return and plotted to pose as Uemura who had lived here before in order to snatch away the registered mail.\nUemura is either confined somewhere else, or has been murdered. They might also made it look like the accident with the TV producer.\n",
    "Aftermath": "",
    "Trivia": "- Mrs. Yamamoto's room from SOS! Messages from Ayumi appears in the first part.\n- When Haibara figured out the case, she made the same face expression as Conan's in a typical case.\n- The suspects' names come from Aesop's Fable \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf\", related to a boy who calls a false alert twice and the third time, when it is real, no one believes him[1] :\nMasao Urafune (浦船 正男) comes from the \"boy who cried wolf\" (wolf (ウルフ ,urufu?) is similar to Urafune) ;\nUemura (植村), the former neighbour of Masao's apartment comes from the \"villagers\" (村人 ,murabito?). Additionally the Isobe Corporation (磯部商事) he works for comes from Aesop (イソップ ,Isoppu?). The similarity with the name Isobe (磯部) and Aesop is used later in The Pop-up Book Bomber ;\nKatsuji Hida (桧田 勝次) comes from the \"sheep\" (羊 ,hitsuji?).\n- Masao Urafune (浦船 正男) comes from the \"boy who cried wolf\" (wolf (ウルフ ,urufu?) is similar to Urafune) ;\n- Uemura (植村), the former neighbour of Masao's apartment comes from the \"villagers\" (村人 ,murabito?). Additionally the Isobe Corporation (磯部商事) he works for comes from Aesop (イソップ ,Isoppu?). The similarity with the name Isobe (磯部) and Aesop is used later in The Pop-up Book Bomber ;\n- Katsuji Hida (桧田 勝次) comes from the \"sheep\" (羊 ,hitsuji?).\n- Masao Urafune (浦船 正男) comes from the \"boy who cried wolf\" (wolf (ウルフ ,urufu?) is similar to Urafune) ;\n- Uemura (植村), the former neighbour of Masao's apartment comes from the \"villagers\" (村人 ,murabito?).
