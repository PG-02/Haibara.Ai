    "Situation": "While walking at the parking lot, Ayumi, Mitsuhiko, and Genta find a car filled with a lot of plastic models and figures. Conan then notices there are scratches around the keyhole and someone has written \"Die!\" in red spray paint on the car's ceiling. The vandalized car turns out to be officer Chiba's friend's car. Officer Chiba calls officer Yumi from the Traffic Department. Officer Yumi and a rookie arrive at the location and officer Chiba finds out there have been three similar cases happened this month. While Yumi teases Chiba, the Detective Boys then realizes the rookie is actually Miike Naeko who is Chiba's first love.\n\nOfficer Yumi explains while officer Naeko shows the pictures of the vandalized cars' and the victims' pictures to officer Chiba and the others. After that, Conan suggests officer Chiba help to investigate the car break-ins. He also suggests he and the others will go with officer Yumi and look around the parking lots on the west side of the town, and officer Chiba can take care of the parking lots on the east side with officer Naeko. After that, The Detective Boys, Professor Agasa, and Officer Yumi spy on the two. The Detective Boys entered the parking lot and hide behind a car and is suddenly scolded for 'playing around' in the parking lot by a passerby woman. A passerby man defends them saying they are just in a playful phase. Another passerby man interrupts and gets angry at the kids for getting close to his car.\n\n\n\nWhile the kids are waiting for Officer Chiba and Officer Naeko, they hear a collision sound and Conan quickly runs to the scene. A series of car break-ins with the word \"die\" spray painted somewhere on the car, seemingly at random, take a turn for the worst when a innocent man is nearly killed.\n\n\n",
