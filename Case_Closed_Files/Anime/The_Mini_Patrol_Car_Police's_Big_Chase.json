    "Situation": "The Detective Boys went to an eel warehouse's exhibit where there was a huge country fair at Genta's recommendation. Professor Agasa had asked them to bring some eels back so he'll cook them but, at the fair, Genta goes to the washroom and disappears. The Detective Boys search for him until they go to the loading deck and see Genta in a van gagged and attached by two mysterious kidnappers. They run after it and just got by Yumi and Naeko's mini-patrol car and tell them to follow the truck since Genta is inside and has been kidnapped. Luckily, they are able to follow the truck with Conan's criminal tracking glasses and Genta's detective boys' badge. They were almost at the car's location when they found out it was stuck in a traffic jam. Yumi decides to use her megaphone to make all the cars move and then yells from her location to the kidnappers who understand they were followed and run away with the van with the mini-car chasing after not far away but, at a railway crossing, they get separated from the van so Conan uses his badge to contact Genta who had taken off the tape covering his mouth but, the kidnappers heard their conversation and break Genta's badge.\n\nThey then think of a way to cut them off at their transactions' location place since they heard the kidnappers were in fact diamond sellers that made an illegal deal at the eel exhibit and that they'd conclude the deal at the harbor since the last known location of their car was towards the harbor before they lost track of them. They needed to do it quickly and save Genta since the kidnappers planned to kill Genta after the transaction. Conan then remembers the kidnappers were communicating in the exhibit using hand signs. Mitsuhiko thinks of the signs' meaning being a gun since they pointed towards a third member of the group, Shintaro Horikawa (probably the boss), with their thumb and their index finger. He remembers back the case of the counting system (burning tent case) and Haibara talking about the english counting system. Mitsuhiko then start another deduction and think about it being the european system so the fingers should be making \"two\" and \"one\" which means they were probably heading to warehouse 21 of the harbor. Still, as they were heading towards this direction, Conan was intrigued and thought something was wrong about the counting system thing.\n",
    "People": "- 24 years old\n- Eel stand vendor\n- Kidnapper\n- 35 years old\n- Eel stand vendor\n- Kidnapper\n- 43 years old\n- Eel vendor\n- 38 years old\n- Buyer\n",
    "Resolution": "\n\nYumi gets out with the others and threathen them to surrender and says they are diamond sellers and that she has proofs of their illegal market to which the kidnappers think is weird but they still decide to fight back. First, Naeko takes down a suspect using a karate throw and Yumi tries to do a german suplex on the other one but since he was overweight, she tells him he should go on a diet before definitely putting him down. She then puts them on custody and shows them a list of laws they didn't respect while the detective boys were proud of the officers' martial arts techniques. In fact, Yumi got it all wrong from the start since the things they sold were in fact eels which are protected and could be sold so high we nickname them diamonds. Thinking all the problems were finished, the two other gang members appear from Shunpei's car and take Genta hostage again.\n\nFinally, Conan throws his ball to them which knocks out both at the same time. Then, all are fighting to know who should get all the credit.\n",
