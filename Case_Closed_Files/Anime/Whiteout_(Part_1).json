    "Situation": "Agasa takes Conan and the Detective Boys to a ski resort in the mountains outside Tokyo. On the way, they meet Kengo Ishibashi and Takeru Yokoyama, whose car is stuck in the snow. The group decides to help those two people move their car out of the snow and back onto the road. After helping, Ishibashi asks for contact information, and opens the back door of his car. Ayumi then notices something frightening inside the car, there are two rifles inside some cases with bullets. Ishibashi says not to worry as they are merely there to enjoy some hunting for sport.\nSome time later, the Detective Boys arrive at the ski resort. Meanwhile, there are two other people, Masaki Mori and Taro Tannai, who wish that they don’t get dragged into more trouble after dealing with some in the past. Ishibashi and Yokoyama then arrive at a cabin. They later start walking through the forest carrying their rifles with them.\nSuddenly, Ishibashi asks Yokoyama about the medicine Ishibashi's company developed. However, since the medicine has a side effect, Yokoyama refuses to use it at his hospital. Hearing that, Ishibashi pulls out his gun, saying that his medicine will be adopted as long as Yokoyama is out of the picture. He also admits that he already tampered with Yokoyama's gun, so he can't use it. Yokoyama in disbelief tries to use his gun to no avail, Ishibashi then throws away his gun and pulls out a knife from his jacket. Both of them then start fighting and struggling over each other.\nMeanwhile, Conan and the Detective Boys are on ski lift. Ayumi accidentally witnesses the fight, which ends with Yokoyama getting stabbed by Ishibashi. At almost the exact same time, Ishibashi looks up and sees Ayumi who is looking down at him, and realizes that she most likely witnessed the murder.\n\nAfter they arrive at the top of the hill, Ayumi then tells Conan and others about the murder she just witnessed. Conan plans to call the police, when suddenly Ayumi in fear points out that Ishibashi was the culprit she saw. As Ishibashi arrives, Conan tells them to stay where they are and runs off to ask the resort staff for help.\nIshibashi then sees the Detective Boys, and approaches them with an evil face intent on keeping them quiet. However, Conan then arrives with some resort staff and tells them about the murder and his deduction. However, Ishibashi manages to deceive the resort staff by claiming they were just kids that he has known for a long time and that they often joke around like this.\nIshibashi then calls someone, before asking them to wait. Conan then uses the opportunity to tell the others to run away using their ski equipment. However, Ayumi and Mitsuhiko end up sliding away too fast and end up going from the ski trail to a steep slope. Luckily, Conan manages to stop them before they crash.\nBecause there is no signal to use their cellphones, they are forced to find a path and ask someone for help. Sometime later they still havn't found any path, while it is starting to snow heavier and heavier. Later, they spot two people walking from a far distance away below them. However, Conan realizes that they are Ishibashi's accomplices, who are looking for them on his orders.\n\nThey quickly turn around and climb the hill, but they are too slow due to the deep snow. When the accomplices are close to reaching them, Conan quickly asks the others to fill the sled with snow, before pushing it down towards the two men. Mori and Tannai manage to avoid and dodge it, but their real target was the tree near the two men. The impact causes the snow that covered the tree to fall onto the two men knocking them unconscious.\nAfter some time, they manage to find a small cabin although it is poor shape. Meanwhile, Ishibashi finds his two accomplices and wakes them up, he tells them that have no choice but to kill the children.\nConan and the Detective boys arrive at the cabin safely. Meanwhile, Ishibashi's accomplices ask him if he really wants to kill the children. Ishibashi reasons that he already killed a man so it is too late to reconsider. He planned to follow the path left by the kids, but Conan had thought ahead and had covered it up halfway using his snowboard. At the ski resort, as the snowstorm continued to become more intense, Agasa tries to call Conan but is unable to reach him.\nFortunately, to his surprise Conan managed to get a weak signal, and managed to call Agasa. However, because the signal is weak their sentences end up breaking apart. Conan quickly tells Agasa about the murder and how the culprit Ishibashi is chasing them. He asks Agasa to call for the police and a rescue team before the call got cut off, as the snowstorm become more intense.\nThe roof of the cabin where they are taking refuge at starts shaking, and Conan decides that they have to move as the cabin would most likely break apart before the storm could subside. Conan knows that there is another bigger cabin with electricity and with a telephone that uses landlines. Using ropes to keep them together, they start walking through the blizzard. Conan keeps track of the next cabin with his glasses.\nSuddenly, some pieces of the small cabin roof broke off and get blown away, the pieces near them throwing them off balance. Their ropes end up getting severed, separating the kids from each other leaving them stranded in the blizzard.\nConan falls down the slope, before using his leg to stop himself. He then realizes that he lost his glasses and hurt his leg. Suddenly, he receives a call from Ishibashi, who got his number from Agasa previously. Ishibashi threatens him telling him that he will die and he can't do anything because he is only a child. The call ends abruptly because Conan's phone died.\nConan then tries to find his glasses by figuring out where he landed and how far his glasses could have been thrown. When he finally finds his glasses, he feels that his hands are freezing. Moreover, the glasses aren’t functioning properly,  however Conan manages to get the glasses to work and starts walking around to find the others. In the end, he tracks and finds them via their detective badges, and together they start walking slowly towards the big cabin.\nThey manage to find and get to the cabin. Conan then quickly run towards the door, when suddenly the snow on the roof falls down and buries Conan. At the same time, three mysterious people approach them while Conan lies unconscious buried under the snow.\n",
