    "Situation": "Kogoro and Shiratori are invited somewhere in the mountains of Tokyo as guests to a wine appreciation party hosted by Murozo Honjo, a wine collector, in order to celebrate the 70th birthday of Shinya Hirose, a famous wine critic. While exploring the villa, Ran and Conan notice Honjo in an argument with Goro Akamaru, a wine critic. From afar, Conan witnesses Honjo smashing a brick into Akamaru's skull.\n\nConan runs to their location but is unable to find evidence of the assault. While Conan investigates, he notices a thread in a barrel, and realizes Akamaru's body was stored there but had been moved to a different location so he would not be found. Conan realizes the only room he had not investigated is the wine storage room which is secured by a system requiring Honjo's fingerprint.\nDuring the wine tasting ceremony, Honjo's prized wine has been found to had the dregs mixed with the wine, ruining the taste. Conan examines the bottle and finds a bloody fingerprint. This leads him to conclude that Akamaru regained consciousness while imprisoned in the wine cellar, and ruined Honjo's wine in an act of revenge. Since he hasn't returned, he's likely still trapped there. The question is, how to get into the wine cellar?\n",

    "Trivia": "- This is the first TV original episode to explain that Shiratori is quite the wine connoisseur, which is established in both The Fourteenth Target and 16 Suspects!?.\n- This time Conan uses a white version of the Voice-Changing Bowtie.\n- There's a reference to the preview wine case in The Locked Wine Cellar.\n- Murozo Honjo's name probably comes from \"Hong jiu\", that literally means Red wine, making a reference to the title and the wine.\n- The four luxury vehicles shown are 1999 Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph (one purple and one grey), 2003 Maybach 57 [W240], and Lexus LS (XF30).\n",
    "Quotes": "- Conan Edogawa:\nPerhaps the true victim in this case might be the bottle whose taste was ruined when it got involved in the dirty infighting between humans... That bottle of wine.  (もしかしたら、この事件の本当の被害者は、人間の醜い争いに巻き込まれ、その味を怪我された、一本のワインかもしれない。)\n",
