    "Motive": "Taeko confesses and reveals that she accidentally murdered Anzai in a fight because he had blackmailed her about her past. She reveals that she had once been in a bad way and had hung out with Anzai and his gang during her high school days. She also reveals that she had indirectly caused the robbery of her grandfather's shrine as Anzai and his gang were the ones responsible for committing the robbery in the first place, which in turn caused the shrine's supervisor, Sugiyama, to commit suicide. Taeko wanted to tell her grandfather the truth, but after Sugiyama committed suicide she panicked believing it was all her fault leaving her with an immense amount of guilt.\n\nEventually she left Anzai's gang and straightened out her life, but she would run into Anzai again and he convinced her that she was responsible for what happened using her guilt and from that point on started to blackmail her. When she went to meet up with Anzai, instead of bringing the money he asked for she brought the knife used during the filming. She had tried to threaten him into leaving her alone instead he lunged at her, as they struggled they both fell, which ended with Anzai landing on the knife. Yuji admits his guilt as well stating that he just wanted to protect her and did so by altering the dying message and disguised himself as Anzai taking his vest, hat, and his very noticeable watch. In the end, both of them are arrested for their crimes.\n- Deceased (hanged)\n- Beika Shrine's supervisor\n",
