    "Situation": "The next day after the case with Sumiko Kobayashi, Jirokichi Suzuki enlists the Detective Boys to defend the amber Kirin's Horn from the greatest thief, Kaitou Kid. Kirin's Horn is secured in the center pillar of a secluded shrine.\nThe pillar will only open when four electrically protected pedestals in the corner of the rooms are opened simultaneously with their respective keys.\nJirokichi Suzuki stakes the key into the wall and awaits for Kaitou Kid's arrival. Kid causes a blackout and the timed explosives destroys the windows causing strong winds to rush inside the shrine. While the Detective Boys protect the pedestals, the center pillar is heard opening. When electricity is restored, they discover Kirin's horn is missing, Conan is knocked out by a taser, and cards signed by Kid attached to all four pedestals. Jirokichi reveals that the shrine had been secretly enforced with steel and an alarm would sound if Kid had escaped through the door and proclaims Kid must be in disguise and inside the shrine; The suspects are Jirokichi, Ginzo Nakamori, or one of the three reporters. Haibara deduces from the inscribed message on the pillar that there is another method to open the pillars without the use of the keys. From the colors and Kanji on the pedestals, Haibara discerns they represent the Four Symbols: the Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, Black Tortoise, and Azure Dragon. She imparts that if something is done in the right order to the four pedestals, it would open the center pillar.\n",
