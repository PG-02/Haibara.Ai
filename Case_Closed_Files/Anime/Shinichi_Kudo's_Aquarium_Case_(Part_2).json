    "Situation": "Ran, Conan and Detective Boys are visiting the Beika Aquarium. They finish watching the dolphin show, while everyone wonders why Professor Agasa is so late. Conan presumes that Professor Agasa was eating yagisoban hamburger near the parking lot. The Detective boys are hungry as well, and decide they want something to eat. Ran tells everyone, that the Beika Aquarim has a Cafe that offers a lot of cute looking food and desserts. The Detective Boys wonder why Ran would know a lot about Cafe, so Ayumi presumes that Ran always visited the place for a date. Ran tells them that she didn't date with anyone, just visited it with someone together.\nWhile Ran is looking at shark, she starts thinking about past when Ran and Shinichi visited the Beika Aquarium. Ran questions to herself if Shinichi liked her at that time already as much as he does now.\nConan's guess proves true, it turns out Professor Agasa was indeed eating yagisoban hamburger.\nConan also starts remembering the day when Ran and him, as Shinichi, visited the place. Shinichi was waiting for Ran inside Beika Aquarium. Ran was late. She tells him that she planned to invite her mother and father to visit the Aquarium for a romantic visit. Shinichi tells Ran not to run, but when Ran asks why, Shinichi though didn't answer her. While Shinichi and Ran were talking, he spots the dead body of Kunihiro Shumoto.\n\nMany bystander bearing witness to the corpse laying close to one of the Aquariums. Shinichi manages to narrow down the suspects to three people by looking up the phone call list of the victim's mobile.

    "Resolution": "[* Means when you take a photo or clip and someone walks in the camera frame they will notice that they are  blocking your video/photo subject thus get out of the way.]\nThe evidence is the blood on her hand covered by her glove. While she used a plastic bag to prevent blood splatter when stabbing the body with the knife, her hand was not covered. Shinichi noticed this after seeing the photo that Naho took with her boyfriend but with gloves of different color.\n",
    "Motive": "Kunihiro was blackmailing her by threatening Naho that he will leak nude photos of her to her current lover, family, and workplace to humiliate her unless she pays him due to the fact that he is in debt.\nWhen the case is closed, Shinichi and Ran were walking in front of Aquarium and talking. Shinichi told Ran again to not run, but Ran still ran due to the rain. She then brought her hood to her head unknowingly that her phone was inside. Ran's phone fell from her hood into the sewer when Shinichi forgot to tell her that he placed it there after testing how the culprit did the trick. Shinichi promises that he will buy a new phone for Ran. Ran still being upset blames Shinichi she tells him that she will only forgive him after treating her in the Tropical Land Shinichi mentions if she ever wins the next Karate Tournament.\n",
