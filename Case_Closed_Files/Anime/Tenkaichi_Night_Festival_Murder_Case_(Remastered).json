    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "During the night of the Tenkaichi Festival at the Okeyama Hotel, the author named Satoru Imatake is brushing his teeth in the bathroom and his friend named Norikazu Sasai is making a mess. When he checked what Sasai's doing, he's confused that Sasai dressed up weird and saw that the hotel room was a big mess. Sasai raises his gun to aim at Imatake's forehead and fired. He also took the rest of the money from his wallet.\n\nHe went out of the hotel room and fled out of the hotel. He throws away his gun, coat, and his glasses. He took the disposable camera out of his pocket.\nWhile at the Tenkaichi Festival, Ran, Conan, and Kogoro are having a good time. Sasai just finally arrived at the festival while sweating. He found Ran and asked her to take a picture of him behind the background of the mountain that says, \"Ichi\" so Sasai gives the camera to Ran and Ran takes a picture. Sasai tells Ran that he's collecting an archive based on the theme, \"Local Festivals\" which is the photo that Ran took. Ran realizes that he's an author. Sasai also told Ran that he writes with the pen name, Tomokazu Imai. After Ran hears that, she got excited that she read about it while at junior high. Kogoro thinks it's strange because he mentions that name was used by Satoru Imatake when he made his debut. Sasai also told them that he's a friend of Imatake and he will drink in celebration for Imatake's Naomoto award. Suddenly, Sasai's sweating more because he's wearing a white jacket. After the conversation, Sasai asked Ran if she could take more pictures of him around the festival and Ran doesn't mind at all. While she's taking pictures of Sasai, the man just appeared behind Sasai. The man's name is Yokomizo, he's a policeman. He wants Sasai for questioning because Imatake's been murdered at the hotel where Sasai is staying.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (gunshot)\n- Author/novelist\n- Author\n- Imatake's friend\n- Representative from Imatake's publisher\n",
    "Resolution": "- Satoru Imatake's murderer was his long-time friend and colleague, Norikazu Sasai. He shot the unsuspecting victim point-blank and left the scene immediately after.\n- Imatake was found dead with traces of toothpaste on his mouth and a toothbrush lying on the ground near him. His wallet was empty and the room was ransacked.\n- Sasai was the primary suspect, but he had an alibi. In his disposable camera, there were pictures of him at the festival; and the festival events coincided with the time the killing took place.\n- Sasai for some odd reason, kept him heavy clothes on although it is plainly obvious that he was sweaty from the heat but he kept his coat on regardless.\nConan, aiding Inspector Yokomizo through Kogoro Mouri, proved that it wasn't just a simple case of robbery and that Norikazu Sasai was indeed the killer. Imatake was murdered while brushing his teeth, an act done without inhibitions in front of people whom a person is very familiar with. The bad condition of the room was evidence enough that the robbery was a setup, for the killer fled the scene right away after the gun was fired.\nAnd the pictures that were seemingly taken that night proving Sasai's innocence were actually taken from the past Tenkaichi festival. In the picture, his wrist was captured without its current watch tan line. He also did not change his clothes to create his alibi, as he wanted his clothes to match what he wearing in the photos taken years ago.\nOver a year ago, Sasai felt ridiculed when the more well-known writer Imatake's work was chosen to be published over his at the last minute. Imatake apparently became famous when he won an award for a book that they co-wrote, while Sasai wasn't credited for it.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is the first case that we see the culprit's actions early as the main characters, as the mystery is to determinate how's Sasai is the culprit who's behind the murder of his friend Imatake.\n- A remastered version of this case was aired on February 25, 2017.\n",
    "Translation changes": "- The names of the characters in the Funimation Dub are:\n- Satoru Imatake (pen name Tomokazu Imai) - Salvador Emerson (pen name Thompson Imus)\n- Norikazu Sasai - Nicodimus Stanley\n- Yamada - Johansen\n"
