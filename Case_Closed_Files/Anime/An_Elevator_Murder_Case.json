    "Situation": "What began as an enjoyable day for Kogoro, Ran, and Conan, who is being interviewed for a potential job as a fashion model, soon turns deadly as a beautiful young lady is found dead. All signs point to a simple break in, but Conan knows that not all is as it seems.\n\n",
    "People": "- Top fashion designer president\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- Eiko's secretary\n- Ashida security guard\n",
    "Resolution": "- There was a wrinkle on Mika’s sleeve, suggesting she was leaning against something during the time of her death.\n- The shoe prints supposedly left by the culprit were too neat, it was as if the killer causally strolled around before leaving.\n- Mika’s body was found lying on her back facing the elevator from outside which is strange, because this means that her killer stabbed her from inside the elevator when the evidence proves otherwise.\n- Flower pollen was found on a different floor, most likely from the bouquet Ran gave to Eiko.\n- Eiko still had the shoes and gloves in her purse that she used to commit the murder with.\n- Eiko somehow “deduced” how Mika was killed after witnessing a robbery in progress even though Conan never had a chance to investigate what had happened.\nThe culprit is Eiko Ashiya. Through Kogoro, Conan reveals that Ashiya called Mika to come in the 15th floor and killed her, then placed Taniguchi's body in the elevator with her back leaning on the door and then sent her to the 8th floor.\n",
