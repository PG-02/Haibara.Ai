    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Conan, the Detective Boys, Haibara, and Professor Agasa are all watching a decisive, fever-pitched soccer game involving the Tokyo Spirits and Noir. While everyone walks out of the stadium, they see a game involving Big Osaka on a store television. Haibara takes special interest in a certain player on the team, Ryusuke Higo, because his situation in soccer closely mirrors her own situation with the Black Organization, though she never admits this. He is considered a \"traitor\" by fans, for going from one team to another, and even fans of his own team boo at him when he makes mistakes.\nWhile Haibara and the Detective Boys are focused on the game, Conan asks Agasa about if he has new information on Chris Vineyard, and learns of a scandal which occured during the burial of her mother Sharon Vineyard. While they watch the game on TV, they spot a man by the name of Kadotake Akano, a self-styled Noir Tokyo hooligan who takes pride on starting trouble and riots during soccer matches. Later on, while everyone is on a train packed with Noir and Tokyo supporters, the hooligan is suddenly murdered, stabbed inside of the train.\n\nInspector Megure and Detective Takagi arrive on the scene. Conan is able to narrow the suspects down to three people, but can he solve the case? And where did Haibara go? The last scene of the episode shows her walking away from everyone.\nAfter questioning the three suspects, Conan still cannot determine who the culprit is, but notices that Haibara is watching the next soccer match on the subway's TV. She empathizes with the player Higo, who has changed from playing for Noir Tokyo to the Tokyo Spirits, but is now hated by both teams.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (stabbed)\n- 48 years old\n- Noir Tokyo supporter\n- Self-styled hooligan\n- 24 years old\n- Noir Tokyo supporter\n- 33 years old\n- Tokyo Spirits supporter\n- 29 years old\n- Noir Tokyo supporter\n- Stationmaster\n- Higo's older half-brother\n- Noir Tokyo player\n",
    "Resolution": "The culprit is Etsutoshi Oba. A year ago, his younger twin brother was pushed down a stadium staircase by Akano during a Noir Tokyo game, because Oba had complained about the boastful tales of violence recounted on Akano's website, Tokyo Hooligan. Akano's misdeed caused the younger Oba's skull to be indented, resulting in his death three days later. Upon reading his brother's blog comments, Oba confronted Akano and thus confirmed him as his twin brother's killer because when Akano (who did not know about the existence of the twin brothers) reacted with a snide comment at Oba's apparent survival.\nOba decided to kill Akano to avenge his brother, but he was incriminated because he wore his brother's Noir Tokyo T-shirt with the name Higo, which would have earned him the Noir fans' undivided wrath if he had actually attended the game as a live spectator while wearing it. Oba had overlooked that fact because he wasn't an avid soccer fan and had followed the match via radio to avoid having Akano disappear into the crowd. Another evidence to incriminate him was an imprint of the knife's sheath on the inside of his upper arm, where Oba had kept it hidden in readiness to deliver his deathblow to Akano.\n- Deceased (brain hemorrhage)\n- Etsutoshi's twin brother\n- Noir Tokyo supporter\n- Killed by Kadotake Akano\n- Oba twins's father\n- Oba twins's mother\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga version, Oba only states what the victim Akano said to him, while in the anime Akano says it himself as a flashback.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The stadium is Ajinomoto Stadium, Nishimachi, Chofu, Tokyo.\n- This is the last episode to use the original vocal version of the Detective Conan Main Theme.\n",
