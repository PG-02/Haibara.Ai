However, Hiroshi Numajiri tells Jirokichi that the truck drove off course and disappeared without leaving traces.\n\nAt the museum there are Sonoko, Haibara, and the Detective Boys. Ran can't contact Shinichi to solve the case, since Conan is investigating with Haibara and can't hear his cellphone, so she calls her father.
