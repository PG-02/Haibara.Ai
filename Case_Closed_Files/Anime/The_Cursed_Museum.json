When they are going to pay the keychain, the Anubis statue falls onto Hiroaki Uchida's body, and he is found dead.\n\nThe museum director, Ken Kowata, feared that it is Anubis' curse, but Conan notice that there is a wound on the victim's head. He also notice the broken platform where the statue was, which seems has been tampered with.\nFrom the security camera, they found out that his wife, Yuko Uchida, also visited the museum that day, along with another visitor, Kiyoshi Yamada. Conan also suspects the museum director and his employee. All of the suspects have no solid alibi.\nTakagi decides to check the victim's and the suspects' backgrounds. He finds out that Hiroaki was involved in many minor crimes, like cheating, brawling, and debt. Later, he receives a phone call from the museum director, who admits that he knows the culprit. However, the culprit is approaching Kowata, and he ends the call. The police rush to the museum, only to find Kowata is being cursed by Anubis. He drops the guest book before being taken to the police station.\nConan then finds out that Yuko has written some code that refers to the place where she will meet someone in the guest book.\n",
