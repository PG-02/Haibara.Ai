    "Trivia": "- In this case, Haibara and the Detective Boys attempted to guess the PIN number of Conan's phone. Haibara guessed 4869 in one try (referencing to Sherlock Holmes), which Conan pretended to be true to trick the culprit into revealing their action. Interestingly, it was exactly his PIN on his previous phone (Ran's Suspicions), and it took Ran a good amount of time to figure out.\n- Agasa's website is named \"www.agasa-hiroshi.com\".\n- Teimuzu river is named after river Thames in England.\n- The suspects' names are related to kite types and materials[1]:\nRyota Renno (廉野 亮太) comes from \"line kites\" (連凧 ,rendako?), a type of kite that forms a symbol or word when put in line with other kites, and glue (糊 ,nori?);\nTakami Renno (廉野 敬実) comes from \"line kites\" and paper (紙 ,kami?);\nYuitoshi Kakura (加倉 由敏) comes from \"cornered kites\" (角凧 ,kaku-dako?), a type of kite with corners, usually square, and strings (糸 ,ito?);\nTakeshi Yatsukoshi (八越 健) comes from \"figure kites\" (奴凧 ,yakko-dako?), a type of kite in the shape of a person with arms stretched out, and bamboo (竹 ,take?).\n- Ryota Renno (廉野 亮太) comes from \"line kites\" (連凧 ,rendako?), a type of kite that forms a symbol or word when put in line with other kites, and glue (糊 ,nori?);\n- Takami Renno (廉野 敬実) comes from \"line kites\" and paper (紙 ,kami?);\n- Yuitoshi Kakura (加倉 由敏) comes from \"cornered kites\" (角凧 ,kaku-dako?), a type of kite with corners, usually square, and strings (糸 ,ito?);\n- Takeshi Yatsukoshi (八越 健) comes from \"figure kites\" (奴凧 ,yakko-dako?), a type of kite in the shape of a person with arms stretched out, and bamboo (竹 ,take?).\n- Ryota Renno (廉野 亮太) comes from \"line kites\" (連凧 ,rendako?), a type of kite that forms a symbol or word when put in line with other kites, and glue (糊 ,nori?);\n- Takami Renno (廉野 敬実) comes from \"line kites\" and paper (紙 ,kami?);\n- Yuitoshi Kakura (加倉 由敏) comes from \"cornered kites\" (角凧 ,kaku-dako?), a type of kite with corners, usually square, and strings (糸 ,ito?);\n- Takeshi Yatsukoshi (八越 健) comes from \"figure kites\" (奴凧 ,yakko-dako?), a type of kite in the shape of a person with arms stretched out, and bamboo (竹 ,take?).\n",
