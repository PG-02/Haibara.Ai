    "Situation": "When a famous samurai movie star, Kozaburo Hijikata, hires Kogoro for some consultations, the group is led to believe that he wants to learn about detective work for an upcoming TV series where he is to star as a detective. However, rumors of an affair between his beautiful and much younger wife Isami Nagakura and stunt actor Hajime Okita can't help but lead Conan to doubt the reason. When Isami is found dead on Okita's balcony, the group believes it is an open and shut case, but Conan doubts the authenticity when he sees a big smile form on Hijikata's face. Which side is truly right?\n\nKogoro tells the media all of the current suspicions so Inspector Megure and Detective Takagi can sneak Hijikata and Okita out the backdoor for questioning, but before doing so Conan goes up to the sixth floor to try and find some evidence that his suspicion of Hijikata being the killer is accurate. In the end one truth as always will prevail, but which side is truly innocent here?\n",

    "Resolution": "And for the second floor number he kept their attention away by standing in front of the digital display, and handing out his business cards by forcing their heads down. Said apartment was right next to the one where Hijikata strangled Isami and left her body to be found by having her body hung with thread which he rigged to snap and caused her body to fall at the right time. With some rope he lowered Isami's lifeless body in the balcony below where her body was actually found. Which explains why Isami's body was found outside the balcony rather than halfway out the door like everyone had witnessed earlier.\nIn reality the room where Isami had supposedly been murdered was actually empty all along as the room belonged to Hijikata, so it was simple for him to have set up this trick. He also switched the room number tags to give the illusion that they were on the fifth floor but they were actually on the sixth. After lowering Isami’s body he switched the room tags back and waited outside the real room on the fifth floor. He also told Kogoro and the others to take the stairs because they were faster, but in reality it was because the altered elevator display hadn't been cleaned yet and he did not want them to find out about it.\n- Evidence\n",
