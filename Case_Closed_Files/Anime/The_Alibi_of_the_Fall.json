Upon entering the building, they are asked to call his sectional number, 423. After getting in contact with him on the phone, they witness the employee Fujihiko Takahata, fall from the building to his death.\n\nThe police are called to the scene and enter Takahata's office discovering a typed suicide note. Conan notices the window is open, a dry spot over the ledge of the window, and a piece of a theatrical property was found on the body and gives Kogoro hints allowing him to deduce Takahata's death. He reveals the prop is the one used in fictional children's show where when shot with a laser gun, deflates. The prop was used to keep Takahata's inert body from falling out the window, and was deflated resulting in his death and allowing the culprit to establish an alibi.\n",
