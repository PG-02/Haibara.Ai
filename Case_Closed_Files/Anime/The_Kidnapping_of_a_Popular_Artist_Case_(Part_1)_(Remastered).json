    "Situation": "Ran and Sonoko are getting ready to attend a huge concert by the very popular J-Pop band Two-Mix. Some hours before that, Conan and the Detective Boys go to a coffee parlor and meet a lady with sunglasses and a cap, who turns out to be the singer of the group, a woman named Minami Takayama whose voice is rather similar to Conan's.\nAt some point, however, Takayama gets outta the parlor and is confronted by two mysterious men in a car. She's then forcibly pushed into the backseat of the vehicle, where her partner Shiina Nagano is bound and gagged! The children witness this and notify Megure and Takagi, trying to help as much as they can to rescue the two artists.\n\nAyumi, Mitsuhiko, and Genta tell Inspector Megure everything except how to find Conan. They decide to ignore Conan's instructions to give the tracking glasses to the police, instead they decide to track down two-mix themselves to get some of the glory. They decide to track him down with the glasses and they learn who the kidnapper is and why the crime was committed.\n",

    "Resolution": "Satoshi Miyahara is the kidnapper who wants to destroy Two-Mix along with the song that they wrote because the lyrics coincidentally reveal the truth behind a murder that he committed. He killed an unknown man last New Year's Eve near Shoenji Temple. That temple is where the Two-Mix came up with the lyrics. It was around 11:50 PM when the bell was ringing out the old year, the police found a dead man holding a gun in his stiff hand. Because one bullet was missing from the loaded gun and smoke was found on the dead man's hand, the court ruled in Satoshi's favor and the case was closed as self-defense. However, that is far from what actually happened. The gun belongs to Satoshi and not to the victim. He intended to kill the victim from the beginning. First, he shot the man dead. Then, he put the reloaded gun in the victim's hand and shot the ground. This way, the police would detect smoke from his hand as though he fired the gun. Satoshi's accomplice is also involved in his past crime. The accomplice carried a bullet and then the empty cartridge of the first shot from the crime scene while Satoshi called the police. It would've been a perfect crime since there are no witnesses. However, the Two-Mix heard them at that time and applied what they heard to their lyrics in the belief that the gunshots were fireworks. Satoshi heard the song on the radio so he decided to destroy the Two-Mix along with the demo tape before the police found them.\nHe admitted his crime and points out that the man he killed was a guy who fled from Japan after their successful robbery. The man suddenly came back and blackmailed them for money saying he would go to the police. Actually, a priest of Shoenji temple saw Satoshi's face when he was on the way to kill that man. However, the priest was deaf and stayed at the temple the whole night.\nWith some tricks from his cell phone, Conan is able to save the captured Detective Boys as well as the Two-Mix members. 30 minutes later, the police arrested the two kidnappers.\n",
    "Remastered version": "A remastered version of this case was aired on August 22, 2015 (Part 1) and August 29, 2015 (Part 2). In order to commemorate the new opening Nazo by La PomPon (OP41) starting September 5, 2015, the remaster episodes use the original opening (OP3) and ending (ED4) instead of the current one.\n",

    "Anime": "- The names of the characters in the Funimation Dub are:\n- TWO-MIX - TWO-TIMES\n- Minami Takayama - Korma Delorica\n- Shiina Nagamo - Karman Santher\n- Satoshi Miyahara - Morshu Esterbaum\n- The Funimation Dub names the manager of TWO-TIMES, Orpheus.\n- Additionally, Funimation had \"BREAK\" completely re recorded with heavy modifications to the lyrics, with the voice actress for Conan/Korma doing the singing.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Minami Takayama (who is also the voice of Conan) and Shiina Nagano both voice themselves in the case.\n- Conan sings Mune ga Dokidoki at the karaoke box during the beginning of episode 81. He later sings \"BREAK\" during the post-credit scene of episode 82.\n- The demo tape song used in this case is LIVING DAYLIGHTS, which had not been released when the manga was serialized, but was released between the airdate of the first part and the second part of the case in the anime. The demo tape song's lyrics are made exclusively for this case, as the original song have different lyrics and arrangement.\n- The song Two-Mix performs at the concert is \"BREAK\". The song is included as the B-side of the LIVING DAYLIGHTS single and has been dubbed in English, Galician, German and Italian in their own dubs.\n- The demo tape song has the lyrics \"Running past the violent 1996\" and \"Running into the bright 1997\". This can be explained that while the anime was aired in November 1997, the manga was serialized in January 1997.\n- The train stations passed by the Detective Boys are Kudanshita Station, Shinagawa Station, Shibuya Station, Kanda Station, Meguro Station, and Otsuka Station.\n",
