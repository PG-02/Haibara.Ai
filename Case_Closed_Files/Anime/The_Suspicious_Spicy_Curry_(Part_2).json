    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, Sonoko, and Conan are on a trip to play tennis when it starts to rain heavily. Later, they find out that the rented car has been washed away and that they are stranded. After walking around, they find a house owned by the same man they met at the tennis court. Later, the man asks them to call his father down, but find him hanged in his room.\n\nConan solves the case but has lost his voice.\n",
    "People": "- 32 years old\n- Tennis instructor\n- Victim (hanged)\n- 65 years old\n- Hiroto's adoptive father\n- Deceased\n- Iwao's wife\n- Hiroto's adoptive mother\n- Deceased 2 years ago (accident)\n- Hiroto's wife\n- Gunma prefecture police officer\n- Gunma prefecture police officer\n",
    "Resolution": "The plan was premeditated with Hiroto waiting at the tennis courts for random travelers to pick up so he could have witnesses to the suicide and prepared an extra batch of curry rice for the occasion.\nUpon discovery of the body, Hiroto hid one of the severed teeth in the curry rice dish his step-father ate and made excuses that the lost teeth were caused due to a previous dental surgery and that the sudden moment of his death caused bleeding from the gums. Conan points out this cannot be the case as his father ate curry like the rest and it is ill-advised for post dental surgery patients to eat spicy food. Noticing the presence of rope markings on his wrists puts further doubt onto the theory of suicide and then the rest of the murder is explained.\n\nThe motive is that Mr Akashi caused the death of Hiroto's wife. One day when it was raining heavily, Iwao Akashi forced the mistress to \ngo to the nearest supermarket and buy mushrooms he insisted on having his dinner with. The trip was dangerous as the Akashis lived in a household isolated from the Karuizawa urban community. To go to the supermarket would mean Hiroto's wife would have to travel a long distance through the forest. She also had a severe cold at the time.\nThe fatigue of traveling and her illness caused her to collapse. She never woke up and it was not until days later that the police discovered her body: albeit completely decomposed from the moisture and fungi.\nHiroto was grieved by his step-father's gross negligence but it was not until he heard his father's last words at the funeral that his outlook of him forever change.\nIwao snickers contentment that his step-son's wife died as she was physically frail and not worth having as a spouse to physically superior tennis coach like Hiroto.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The tennis court in this case is the same tennis court that appears in Conan in a Locked Room.\n- This is the first case that mentioned the owner of Cafe Poirot, who apparently volunteered to take care of an unwell Conan for that day.\n- This is the first time since Magic Lover's Murder Case, that Conan had had a cold, only this time, he fell into a river, and hurt his wrist, and had to wear a sling, and lost his voice.\n- When Sonoko stated that they are heading to Kariorizawa, and Conan mentioned wanting to see Sonoko's summer home in Kariorizawa, they might be referring to Karuizawa, which the OVA 16 Suspects!? took place in. However at the time of the OVA, the Suzukis did not have a villa or summer home there at the time. The Kudos did, but not Sonoko's family. If it is the same local, they may have bought or built one since then.\n- This is the first time that Sonoko will refer to herself as the \"Queen of Deductions\".\n- This is the case that the Deduction show really was a game of charades.\n",
