    "Situation": "While on the way home from school, Conan, Haibara, and the Detective Boys meet Shukichi, who in chance heard the group conversation about the term \"yaocho\" (match fixing). It was because of the death of Kimiharu Nishikido, a shogi player who was suspected of match fixing.\n\nLater, Shukichi leaves for an important meeting, but the group meet Yumi, who is following Shukichi because he is acting strange. Haibara then says that Shukichi might have an affair. Yumi decides to take Conan with her.\nShukichi then enter a donut shop. While waiting for Shukichi, Conan asks Yumi if she has meet Shukichi's parents. Yumi says that Shukichi was adopted by the super rich Haneda family when he was trying to be a professional shogi player, so that Shukichi could fullfill Kohji Haneda's dream. Yumi also aware of Shukichi's biological family, betting that the whole family is also carfree like him. Conan, who knows about the family, says nothing about it.\nYumi then realizes that they are in front of Star Donut, which Yumi sugested Shukichi to go. Yumi is happy, but only for a while, because Shukichi is later seen talking to two women. She then approaches him, only to find that the two women are happy to meet Yumi.\nThe two women, Mina Katsumata and Shoko Uryu, are young shogi players who are attending shogi study session. Shukichi is involved because he is asked by Chikara Katsumata, Mina's father.\nThey arrive at an apartment, where another young shogi player, Kosuke Hishinuma, is waiting. There is also another shogi player, Yasukiyo Genda, who is waiting in the apartment. However, Genda is not answering the bell, so they enter the building using the spare key brought by Mina.\nThey arrive at the room and found the door is not locked. After some searching, Hishinuma finds Genda's body in the kitchen.\n\nShukichi touchs the kitchen counter and notices something near mixer, toaster, and ice trays.\nTakagi and Sato later arrive at the crime scene. Shukichi, knowing the reason why Yumi followed him, has a small argument with her, before get interupted by Sato.\nSato and Takagi starts questioning the others, suspecting that they might pretend to buy food and kill Genda. Hishinuma, who bought cups of coffee, said that the water heater is broken, and the stove is not hot. Mina bought freshly baked bread, and there is no microwave, so it is impossible to reheat the bread. Shoko bought some ice cream, and they had checked the freezer to make sure there is no ice cream before go to buy it. They also meet each other before heading to the apartment and they didn't bring any food beforehand.\nSato deduces that the murder might be the work of an outsider, and a serial murder. There is a shogi board with two missing legs next to Genda. In Nishikido case, a shogi board with one missing leg was found. It was revealed that Genda and Nishikdo were friends. The shogi study session is originally run by Genda, Nishikido, Yuhei Kishimoto, and Kinji Uryu. Kinji, who is Shoko's older brother and Mina's boyfriend, committed suicide. After that, Kishimoto became depressed.\n\nConan warned that there might be more murders, since there are two remaining legs on the shogi board. Sato plans to talk to Kishimoto, so she asks Hishinuma. He later points out from the window the house next to a public bath. However, a smoke appears from that place. Sato then warns the others that they might be the next target.\nSato and Takagi meet Yuminaga at the crime scene. Kishimoto is found burnt in the house, and might still alive before the fire started because his rectal temperature hadn't fallen much. Next to Kishimoto, a shogi board with three missing legs is found. Yuminaga then surprised that Conan, who is observing the shogi board, is there.\n\nThat night, Shukichi goes to the culprit house to encourage them to turn in to the police.\nThe next day, while on the way home from school, Conan recalls the case. He was interupted by Genta who was annoyed by capsule toys machine, so he decides to mix up the machine.\nLater, he get a phone call from Yumi. Shukichi has been missing since last night and she asks Conan if he knows where Shukichi is. Conan recalls that Shukichi might notice something. Yumi also mentions that Shukichi seems to forget something when they left the apartment, but after he came back, he admitted that it was a mistake on his part.\nYumi then ends the call. Chiba and Naeko, who are with Yumi at the time, deduce that Shukichi might be shocked after Yumi tried to tail him. Hearing that, Yumi is angry, then teases both of them for getting along so well. However, they admit that they had an argument last night.\nMeanwhile, Shukichi is abducted by the culprit. After he enters the room, the culprit use stun gun to knock him out and tied him to the leg of a table. Shukichi deduces that the culprit is waiting for police announcement, but he already prevent that.\n\nConan then call Akai to help him find Shukichi. Yusaku, who is also in the living room with Yukiko, decide to help with the case too. After Conan mentions the things that was on the kitchen counter, Yusaku finds out something that can be use to fabricate an alibi. Conan, recalling what Genta was doing earlier, also finally solves the case.\nAkai, without his Subaru disguise and only use a hat and a sunglasses, picks up Conan with his Subaru car in front of Ramen Ogura. Conan says that Shukichi's phone is not active. Akai deduces that Shukichi decide not to bring along the phone containg information about his close friend. He then calls Shukichi's other phone, which is used for secret conversation with him. Shukichi, knowing that Akai is calling him, answer the phone, and asked the culprit to do blind shogi. Akai then uses GPS to find Shukichi's location.\n",

    "Resolution": "They finally arrived at the apartment where Shukichi was abducted and taken to. Akai then honks the car horn so that Shukichi knows that he and Conan are there to rescue him. Using blind shogi, Shukichi tells Conan and Akai the room where he is abducted. However, to do that, Shukichi had to intentionally make a bad move. Hishinuma realizes it, then discovers the phone and smashes it. He threatens Shukichi saying that he will kill him.\nUsing his phone, Conan finds Shukichi’s exact location. Akai then makes a plan to save Shukichi.\nConan kicks his soccer ball to the clothline pipes to change its angle. Akai uses the Voice-changing Bowtie and sets it to the loudspeaker mode to warn Hishinuma. When Hishinuma threatens to kill Shukichi, Akai uses his gun to shoot through the pipe and into the window glass. Hishinuma then tries to run away, but Conan manages to tranquilize him.\nShukichi then tells Conan that Nishikido, Genda, Kishimoto, and Kinji kept pens equipped with a miniature camera in their coat pockets to cheat during their shogi matchs. It worked fine, until Kinji got warned for going to bathroom too often. When he told the others, they told him to follow the rule of silence, which means that if any of them were in danger of being exposed, he would keep the group's secret and kill himself to protect the others.\nHishinuma, who found the suicide suspicious, tracked down one of the members of the group Nishikido and forced him to confess everything before killing him. After learning that two others were involved in this cheating circle, he decided to kill them as well in order to avenge his best friend Kinji. Hishinuma admitted to Shukichi that Nishikido and his fellow cheaters are a disgrace to all shogi players.\nHishinuma had prepared a confession letter, which was meant to frame Kishimoto. In the letter, Kishimoto killed the other two, then committed suicide due to the guilt of what they had done. Hishinuma was waiting for the police to find the letter, but Shukichi had already intercepted it.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- The anime adds some flashback scenes:\n- Momiji Ooka's Challenge: Heiji mentioned about Haneda family and Conan's thought about Haneda family is wealthy.\n- Taiko Meijin's Match of Love: the match between Chikara and Shukichi, and Shukichi telling Yumi about the match.\n- In episode 1035, there are some flashback scenes from episode 1034, when Takagi and Sato are questioning the suspects.\n- The scene when the group is searching for Genda is longer in the anime, thus some dialougue are added.\n- In the original manga version, Kishimoto's cause of death is unknown, whereas it is shown that he died from being stabbed in a flashback from episode 1035.\n- In the manga, after Shukichi was saved, Akai directly called Camel, while Shukichi was talking to Conan. In the anime, while Conan and Shukichi are talking to each other, Akai is seen tying the culprit, and calls Camel after Shukichi and Conan finished talking.\n- The anime removes Mary and Yumi background appearances when Shukichi mentions that Mary is refusing to meet Yumi.\n",
