    "Situation": "The antidote to the APTX 4869 begins to wear off and Shinichi is about to change back to Conan. Ran holds onto him and refuses to let him go but is tranquilized by Haibara and Shinichi is able to become Conan again without anyone noticing.\nOn another day, the Detective Boys are on a camping trip when Professor Agasa's car runs out of gas, stranding them in the middle of the mountain. A man named Goki Sudo drives by and refuses to help their situation. Soon after, Sudo drives to his home atop the mountain and an explosion occurs.\n\nThe Detective Boys arrive to find Sudo dead. The police investigate and declare the death as an accident caused by a lit cigarette and spilled gasoline which vaporized in the garage. As the police interrogates Sudo's fiancée, Ena Ginbayashi, Conan reveals Sudo was not smoking a cigarette and that something else caused the explosion. Due to Ena's inconsistency with her story, Conan deduces the explosion was a planned murder by Ena.\nConan interrogates the party guests at Sudo's home and learns Ena has been persuading her husband to wear his wool sweater under his fleece jacket and to use his classic car for the past three weeks.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (explosion)\n- 34 years old\n- IT company president\n- 31 years old\n- Sudo's fiancée\n- Sudo's dog\n- Ena's friend\n- Ena's friend\n- Tokyo Fire Department police officer\n- Tokyo MPD Forensics Officer - Arson Divison\n- Ena's guest\n- Ena's guest\n- Ena's guest\n- Ena's guest\n- Ena's guest\n- Ena's guest\n- Ena's guest\n- Ena's guest\n- Ena's guest\n- Ena's guest\n",
    "Resolution": "- Deceased\n- Ena's mother\n- Shocked due to her husband's previous death\n- Deceased (heart attack)\n- Ena's father\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- The scene in which Conan and Heiji were reflecting on Shinichi holding Ran's hand during his transformation was from the manga version of The Revolving Sushi Mystery, Part 1, but was included due to following up on What She Really Wants to Ask.\n- In the manga, Conan is shown sitting in the back of Agasa’s beetle between Haibara and Ayumi. While in the anime, Conan is sitting in the front passenger seat and feels Haibara’s glare rather then seeing it like in the manga.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The car Goki Sudo was driving to Sudo household and exploded is a Brown 1963 Rolls-Royce Phantom V by James Young.\n",
