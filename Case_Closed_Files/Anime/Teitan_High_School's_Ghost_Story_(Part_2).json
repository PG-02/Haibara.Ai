    "Situation": "Sonoko, Ran, and Conan go to Teitan High School to investigate mysterious events supposedly caused by the grudge of a dead student named Hideaki Hosaka. Ran and Sonoko greet some friends and introduce Conan to them; the friends tease Conan and Ran by saying Shinichi and Conan rather alike. Conan then runs into the real Dr. Araide, who has returned. He informs Conan of that he had been hiding overseas with his family, and told him that Jodie told him to tell Conan everything. Ran asks Dr. Araide to help investigate the ghost story with them.\nSonoko explains there are three stories showing that the student's ghost is terrorising the school in the early morning hours. The first is that a girl heard the sound of someone sobbing in the sports warehouse where the dead student's desk is stored. After bringing a professor to investigate, the crying had stopped and, no one was found inside. Third year student and Ran's Karate senpai, Kazumi Tsukamoto, interrupts after overhearing the story, saying Hideaki Hosaka fell down a set of stairs and that wind blowing through a small window may account for the sounds heard. Kazumi Tsukamoto notices that it has started raining outside and suggests Ran and company go the library and that she will help with the investigation. On the way, they cross Seko Kunishige who goes to the nurse's office.\nIn the library, Sonoko relates the second story. Four mornings in a row, books that had been borrowed by Hosaka were found scattered around in the library. Finally, Sonoko and gang go to the stairs that Hosaka died after falling from for the last tale. An unexplained puddle of water formed at the bottom of the stairs, and supposedly the number of steps on the stairs changes. The last part was disproved when Conan notices Sonoko messed up her count. While they were arguing, art student Monobe Masao berates them for being loud.\nRan looks out the window and sees a desk outside that hadn't been there earlier. Conan and Araide run out to investigate. The desk was the one from the sports warehouse, and a weighed down note atop it reads: \"My resentment isn't gone yet\". Furthermore, Conan notices that although it had been raining, there are no footprints in the mud around the desk, and the desk and the note are dry.\n\n",

    "Manga to anime changes": "- The anime adds the scene in the beginning where Ran had a nightmare about seeing a ghost at the school.\n",
    "Trivia": "- While The Seven Mysteries of Teitan Elementary School Case took place primarily in Teitan Elementary School, this case takes place primarily in Teitan High School.\n- This case is the first real appearance of Tomoaki Araide, since his first appearance in The Blind Spot in the Darkness, when he was most likely already replaced by Vermouth in his second appearance in The Desperate Revival.\n- It is most likely safe for Dr. Araide to return to Teitan High School, and to his clinic, since Vermouth is no longer pretending to be him since she was outed in Head-to-Head Match with the Black Organization: A Dual Mystery on a Full Moon Night.\n- The trial from Dr. Araide's case in The Blind Spot in the Darkness had taken place already off-screen, since Ran and Sonoko heard that after the trial he was to go somewhere else. They are both surprised to see him at school, while Conan is shock, as he remembered Vermouth disguising as him, and wondered if she is nearby.\n- The English dub debuted on Adult Swim on the same day the first part of this case aired in Japan.\n",
