    "Resolution": "- Katsuhiko’s heart literally stopped on Valentine's Day. Beside his dead body, a cigarette and a chocolate bar were found among his usual items.\nBefore the tragedy, he was in his small party where they ate and drank. On Valentine’s day (because of the tradition), each girl gives a guy a bar of chocolate, to which the guy would consume preferentially.\nConan noticed that even though her son died, Katsuhiko's mother is doing the dishes.\nSusumu ate chocolate which angered his mother, but she suddenly had a change of heart and gave him some cake despite Susumu's previous troubles with cavities.\n- Katsuhiko’s heart literally stopped on Valentine's Day.

Meanwhile, his mother knew his habits, and put poison in his coffee, knowing that he wouldn't have eaten the antidote in the cake. The reason she had a change of heart when Susumu drank the coffee is because he took the poison, so she quickly gave him the antidote in the cake so he wouldn't die. She also tried to frame Yoshimi by switching the chocolate she gave him with a half-eaten bar that Katsuhiko apparently ate. Though his mother immediately washed all the cups and switched the chocolates, it is pointed out that forensics could inspect the drainage to find the poison and the swapped chocolate is already visibly melting through the culprit's kimono. After Kaori exposes Katsuhiko's back story and his love for Yoshimi, she breaks down and confesses, apologizing to Yoshimi for everything.\nWhen her husband's business took a turn for the worse, Katsuhiko's mother had to think of the quickest way to acquire Katsuhiko's estate, and save the house.\nKatsuhiko was an orphan who was adopted by his only living relative, his paternal aunt, when he was a kid. His foster mother knew he fell in love with Yoshimi since she closely resembled his deceased mother, so she tried to frame her.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This episode features the first use of the anime's second post-credits stinger image, featuring Conan in a \"thinking\" pose.\n- When the Detective Boys are handing out flyers, Genta refers to them by the English 'Detective Boys' rather than the typically used Japanese 'Shōnen Tantei-dan.'\n- This is Sonoko's first appearance in the anime. However, she wouldn't appear in the manga until Mountain Villa Bandaged Man Murder Case.\n- This is Ryo Horikawa's first vocal appearance in the series. He plays the victim Katsuhiko, but returns to voice Heiji beginning in Diplomat Murder Case.\n",
