    "Situation": "Conan followed Ran to attend a karate class for children; owing to the fact that their instructor, Ryota Goda, had injured his arm, Ran was requested to substitute him as the children's karate teacher. Just as Ran began to start her warm-up session with the children, Goda strolled upstairs somberly to meet Noriyuki Momohara, the person who owned the building where the karate class was leasing. Momohara posed a rather annoyed face and complained greatly about the loud noises made due to karate classes. Regardless of how Goda attempted to implore for a longer rent, Momohara manifested no tolerance anyhow.\nRan realised that she forgot her fist supporters, and Goda lent him his. That way, the class was able to proceed with adequate equipment. Midway through the intriguing part, the lights were shut, and Goda walked towards the power supply room to fix the outage issue; Conan desired to come along, yet was rejected by Goda with the reason of \"out of reach\". After some time, everyone in the karate classroom heard a scream emanating from the top. To examine the circumstances, Conan and Goda ran rapidly to Momohara's room, where the scream was heard. Goda saw Toru Namisugi in panic, who apparently had discovered the dead Momohara.\n\nThe police had arrived at the crime scene to analyse the crime situation: the estimated time of Momohara's death was about three hours ago. Right beside the table that Momohara had fallen upon, an opened safe was visible, with a piece of lease contract paper placed inside. Conan poked around the crime scene and discovered a warm coffee machine and deduced that it might have been working some time ago, yet no cups were found within the room. Accordingly, the police decided to enquire about the suspects in this case - and Toru Namisugi was the first one: the victim and he had been friends since high school; after the victim's dad passed away six months ago and the victim had succeeded his father's company, he had been assisting in management work within the company. At around 5 P.M. he entered the victim's room and discovered the corpse beside the desk. He also said that normally the safe is closed, and the victim often deposits cash inside every month.\nAfter a while, the police discovered the murder weapon utilised in this case - a gold club. It was exceedingly obvious to notice as the one used as murder was placed upside-down. However, Conan doubted if the golf club was really the weapon for murder; he said that by judging at the victim's wound, the culprit had struck his head at his back, yet if the weapon was a gold club, then there would not be sufficient space to sweep the club properly in the air, not to mention implementing a murder. Accounting for the drag marks that remained on the floor of the victim's room, Conan speculated that the body must have been moved after Momohara was killed. Out of the crime scene, Conan encountered Ran and learned that Inspector Megure wanted to talk to Goda once again. Nonchalantly, Ran uttered that she forgot to return Goda's fist supporters and added the fact that they had got one of the shin pads missing. Conan went puzzled and inquired of Ran about shin pads[N 1], and Ran showed him a photo of it, which made him solve half of the mystery.\nOn Goda's end, the police explained their hypothesis of the corpse being moved by the culprit to Goda. Goda then snarled with fear; he kept reminding the police about his injured arm, thus he may not be able to drag the victim easily. Nonetheless, Chiba suggested a trick: by tying the compression bandage around the victim's torso using the other hand and teeth, even if Goda had the other hand injured, he could still be able to drag the corpse with one hand across the room readily. By reviewing the renewal date of that contract placed in the safe, the police realised that it was right before Momohara's death; therefore, they concluded that most probably, Goda renewed it himself, as the victim and he were at odds on this matter. The reason for him to move the corpse was also to unlock the victim's computer using face recognition in order to renew that contract. In reality, did Goda commit the crime, or was he being wronged?\n",
    "People": "- 27 years old\n- Karate dojo instructor\n- Victim (beaten)\n- 25 years old\n- Momohara building owner\n- 25 years old\n- Momohara's classmate & business partner\n- Tokyo MPD CSI officer\n- Karate dojo student\n- Karate dojo student\n- Karate dojo student\n",
    "Resolution": "",
    "The Real Culprit": "The evidence (Goda's fingerprints on the gold club) for the police's deduction was absolutely untenable, as Goda touched that gold club when he had to fix the power outage during that \"blackout\", since it was \"out of reach\" to him as well. After he fixed the power issue, he placed the gold club back and walked into the victim's room. At that time, he had already discovered Momohara dead, but on the sofa. To renew the contract, he moved the body.\nAll of these happened because the actual culprit, Toru Namisugi, knew the fact that Goda would need to use a gold club to turn on the circuit breaker every time a power outage occurs. On the other hand, the power outage itself was caused by the culprit, Namisugi, so he could lure Goda to touch that gold club. He was able to accomplish this by taking advantage of that coffee machine. Based on Conan's deduction, the victim did not set up the coffee machine himself since there were no cups in the room, so it must have been done by the culprit to fabricate an alibi. After killing Momohara, he set the timer up on the coffee machine and devised an alibi at the horse racing stadium.\nBy doing this, Namisugi could indirectly conduct Goda to put the breaker back on while discovering the body, yet he did not anticipate that Goda actually had moved the body after the discovery. Seeing that Goda had somewhat unravelled his initial plan, he quickly ran upstairs and unlocked the safe to make it look like a robbery.\n",
    "The Motive": "Namisugi knew that the safe was normally empty, hence he did not need to dispose of any fortune from the safe, and this would explain why he did not notice that contract paper placed within (he was too certain about it so did not even bother to peer inside). To end the accusation, Conan surmised that the evidence must be concealed within Namisugi's colourful socks; there was a huge marking caused by the victim grabbing as Namisugi removed the sock.\nHis motive was that Momohara had been taking advantage of him for his own benefit. On the contrary, Namisugi did not respect the victim at all, as without him, Momohara could not manage anything in the company; this also explained why the safe key only had Namisugi's fingerprint but not Momohara's (Momohara's probably did not even know where the safe key was).\n",
