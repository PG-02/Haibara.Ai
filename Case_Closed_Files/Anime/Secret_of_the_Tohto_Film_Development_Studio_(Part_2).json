    "Situation": "Yukiko brings Conan, Haibara, and the Detective Boys to watch a Kamen Yaiba movie preview. Once there, they find out the movie has been delayed to later that night. Yukiko having to leave to catch her flight to America, leaves the kids in the care of Akira Hojima, one of the four employees of the Kamen Yaiba film. Before leaving, Yukiko tells Conan to be careful of the black car that has been following them. Akira takes the kids to his apartments near the studio and invites his fellow employees to a game of Mahjong. While everyone is asleep, they are awakened by a scream and find the salesman Norihiro Furumura murdered with a kitchen knife.\n\nConan wonders how the murder was done in an impossible to see darkness without making a sound in a messy room.\nThe police investigate and find that Furumura's camera was turned on during the attack and reveals no suspicious sound was made. While the police suspect Akira to be the murderer, it is revealed that Akira and his two fellow employees have motives on murdering Furumura. He ruined their previous film due to his careless handling of the negatives causing them a great loss in money to re-film the ruined sections.\n",
    "People": "- 46 years old\n- Colorist\n- 42 years old\n- Film cutter\n- 28 years old\n- Printer\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- 39 years old\n- Salesman\n",
    "Resolution": "Yoshikiko confesses and reveals that the parts of the film Furumura ruined could never be re-filmed as one of the main side actors died. The killer has used florescent (see in the dark) tape on desks and tables to find the victim and stab him. He then used it again to escape without making a sound, framing someone else in the process. These fluorescent tapes were actually put up by Akira Hojima originally to guide himself to the toilet in the dark without making noise. Yoshikiko simply exploited this feature, having used to be in charge of filming.\n",
