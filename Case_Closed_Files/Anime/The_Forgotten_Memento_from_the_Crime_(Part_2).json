    "Situation": "A man seeks out Kogoro Mouri to help find his passed wife's wind-up watch in his apartment. Thinking it's a ridiculous request, Kogoro refuses, and instead Professor Agasa and the Detective Boys offer help. When everyone arrives in his house, a woman knocks and asks for the money the man loaned. He returns part of it and lets her borrow a film she has been looking for. As she was eager for seeing it, she begins to watch it right there in the video room. Conan finds the watch, which is still working even though it's supposed to be stopped. The woman is found dead and the tape in the VCR rewound.\n\nAs an aside, Detective Takagi tells Conan that someone stole all of Kogoro Mouri's police case files on the day of the busjacking case from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. Despite what the circumstances look like, Conan does not think that Idetsuki was attacked by a burglar. When he notices the scent of burnt flowers, he finds the hidden truth of the crime scene.\n",
    "People": "- 49 years old\n- Coffee shop employee\n- Victim (bludgeoned)\n- 46 years old\n- Apartment owner\n- Deceased\n- Hideo's wife\n",
    "Resolution": "- Morita set up the second video player with a videotape inside above the one Idetsuki used to be controllable with the same remote as the lower one and placed a vase with flowers identical to the one in hallway in fron of it, hidden by the curtains. Once Idetsuki finished watching the movie, she used the remote to eject the videotape and crouch down on the floor to retrieve it, causing the vase to be pushed off the shelf and crushes on her head, killing her. The video tape in the above machine would then be pushed back inside due to force, concealing the evidence. Morita would then have a solid alibi during the \"time of attack\".\n- To camouflage the crime as an attack from the outsider criminal, he removed the vase in the hallway which was separated in to two parts in advance and hid them in the cupboard among the dishes and tableware. The flowers were heated in the microwave and thrown in the trash can.\nMorita confess that he killed Idetsuki for persuading his late wife to invest in the stock market, drowning her in debt, and was responsible for her suicide-accident. She had told him the truth the day before her death and took off the watch because she didn't want it to be destroyed along with her. Morita was then taken into custody.\n",
    "Continuity": "- When Ran gave Agasa and the Detective Boys some chocolates, with their likenesses, Conan wondered where they were at, since he did not see them at the lodge, linking this case to The Truth Behind Valentine's case.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Due to the 2002 Winter Olympics closing ceremony broadcast, Episode 270 was aired 2 weeks after Episode 269.\n- The movie that Eiko Idetsuki was watching starred the main character of one of Gosho's short stories, Play It Again, but used a different voice actor.\n",
