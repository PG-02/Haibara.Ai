    "Situation": "At the Beika Gourmet Restaurant Street, Kogoro and Conan talk with Takashi Yamaura, owner of the Italian Izakaya \"RESO\", while having their dinner in his establishment. However, they are disrupted by the destruction of the bar's wall by the owner of the alley, Hiroyuki Kusumi. Due to the fact that numerous shop owners in the alley rejected the demolition request from him, Kusumi thus attempts to harass them, causing one of the shop owners to die under stress. Under the assistance of Fumio Nakano, owner of Sushi \"Sakura-ya\" and Yuji Yonezawa, owner of Creative Cuisine \"Seventy Seven\", Kogoro successfully controls the situation and makes Kusumi walk away.\n\nNot long after, Conan wants to use the toilet. The toilet uses a special coin mechanism to unlock and lock the door. 15 minutes later, when Kogoro wants to use the toilet, he discovers the unconscious Kusumi inside. It was believed that he tripped in the toilet and hit his head. However, Conan realizes it is not an accident.\n\nThe police then investigate the crime scene. Later, they discover that Fumio is the only one that did not have an alibi, so they search her restaurant to find the weapon used.\n",
