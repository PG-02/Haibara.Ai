    "Situation": "The Detective Boys are wandering the streets in the residential area around Professor Agasa's house, worrying about Haibara, who has gone missing since she went shopping several hours ago. At first, Genta, Mitsuhiko, and Ayumi are wondering whether Haibara has become the victim of a traffic accident, but then Conan finds a cat's shawl lying on the street. Seeing this, he remembers how he, Haibara and the Professor recently met a friendly young woman named Mitsuru Higaki, along with her pet cat Chiro, who wore the shawl, and her Indian Star Tortoise.\nSearching the vicinity for Chiro, they find the kitten inside a well in a park, but when they try to return it, Mrs. Higaki does not answer the doorbell, so they take the cat back to Agasa's house to feed it. After contacting Chiba to learn whether there have been any accidents in the area none have, Conan tries to contact Haibara through her badge, but to no avail. And it's no small wonder, since at that very moment Haibara awakes to find both herself and Mrs. Higaki inside a darkened living room, solidly tied and gagged.\n\nAs soon as her situation becomes clear and she has realized that she has been out for five hours, Haibara remembers how she came by after concluding her shopping and spotted Chiro struggling with his shawl, which was wrapped around the leg of a telephone table. When she attempted to free the kitten, she was suddenly grabbed from behind and chloroformed, never getting a chance to see her attacker's face. Then she notices that the TV set in the room is running on silent mode, in which a newsflash appears that announces the murder of Naoshi Higaki, Mrs. Higaki's husband.\n\n",
    "People": "- Victim (kidnapped)\n- 35 years old\n- Housewife\n- Victim (murdered)\n- 42 years old\n- Businessman\n- Mitsuru's husband\n- Mitsuru's pet cat\n- TV news announcer\n- Liquor store owner\n- Driver\n",
    "Resolution": "In order to facilitate the deception, Mitsuru purchased a new apartment house in the Airport Village and decorated it identically to her own living room, thus creating the illusion that she and Haibara were held captive in her home, which would be too far away for her to get to Hokkaido, commit the murder, and return in time. With the fake apartment close to the airport, Mitsuru was able to use the five hour interval in which Haibara was unconscious to fly to Chitou, murder her husband and return to transport Haibara back to her own house. The terrarium with her Star Turtle served as the chief implement to make Haibara believe that she was actually imprisoned in Mitsuru's house.\nThe decisive pieces of evidence are:\n- The fact that the wine delivery man rang the doorbell to Mitsuru's apartment six times in rapid succession, but Haibara heard the bell ringing, which actually originated from a prepared recording, only twice, and at a much slower pace;\n- The floor in the fake apartment has a shifted floor, due to jerry-building, poorly executed construction. That fact was noted in a newspaper article featuring Airport Village. Conan stumbles upon that clue after Haibara remembers the odd way the soda can on the table rolled around as she was chloroformed the second time.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The truck is a 1999 Toyota Dyna. The license plate number is 新宿 400, い 23-61 (Shinjuku 400, I 23-61).\n",
