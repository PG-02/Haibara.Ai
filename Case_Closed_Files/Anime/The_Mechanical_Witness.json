    "Resolution": "It was tuned to spray and detect traces of a special ink (of a type which Isshiki kept at home, and which got stuck on his shoes) the culprit left at the scene of his thefts. Tanizaki met in secret with Makita, an HR employee at Myojo Technics, in order to find out the dates of their newest presentations, thus learning when the thief would strike next.\nUpon catching Isshiki in the act, Tanizaki attacked and attempted to restrain him but was wounded in the process. As Isshiki attempted to escape, his rope came undone when the gas pipe he had tied it on broke because he had repeatedly used it to vault down the window every time he broke in, and he began to fall.\n"
