    "Situation": "One afternoon, an old woman named Shigemi Terakado and the mover Ryuji Matsuo were planning to rid a young woman named Motoko Kawaguchi from existence. Their plan was to murder her and bury her in the mountains.\nAfter that, a man named Haruki Toriumi hired Kogoro to investigate his missing fiancée, the aforementioned Motoko. Toriumi felt that she must have gotten in an incident, so Kogoro and Conan investigated.\nThree nights ago, Motoko said that she suddenly decided to move and had movers to pick up her stuff. On the same night, she also suddenly decided to quit her job. Motoko suddenly disappeared from her home and workplace. Another young lady named Suda Kumi appeared and asked where Motoko was. She said that they ran into each other in the city at that evening, that Motoko was her usual self and said that she was going to meet up with Terakado.\nKogoro and Conan went and asked Terakado about Motoko, since Terakado owed Motoko much for looking after her. She said she hadn't seen Motoko for a month. But her neighbor, Mitsue Uno, said that Terakado met Motoko three days ago. She also said that Motoko was causing trouble to Terakado, via extorting her fir money. This made Kogoro and Conan believe that Terakado was lying and killed Motoko Kawaguchi with the help of Ryuji Matsuo, who moved her stuff.\n\n",
    "People": "- 67 years old\n- Spinster\n- 23 years old\n- Mover\n- Victim (bashed)\n- 25 years old\n- Office worker\n- 33 years old\n- Motoko's fiancé\n- 45 years old\n- Apartment landlady\n- 25 years old\n- Motoko's friend\n- 55 years old\n- Shigemi's neighbor\n- Passerby\n",
    "Resolution": "Toriumi confronted Kawaguchi, who confessed everything. Kawaguchi thought he would understand her desperation, but instead he dragged her into his car and strangled her to death, then hid her body in the mountains. The cuff link, a special-order item which Toriumi had received just before the deed and fell off when he kidnapped Kawaguchi (with his and Kawaguchi's fingerprints on it), is evidence that they met at that evening.\n\n",
    "Trivia": "- Haruki Toriumi car drive is a 2015 White Lexus RC [SC10].\n- The panel van is a Subaru Sambar.\n"
