    "Situation": "Genta's father is in a competition where anyone with the surname Kojima are allowed to participate. The prizes given are 10 million yen and a Japanese painting of a boar worth 50 million. The boar painting were created alongside a Japanese painting of a deer and butterfly and when the three are gathered, are rumored to make the owner lucky. The host is a rich entrepreneur named Gonsaku Kojima, who owned the three; It is revealed he lost the deer and butterfly paintings and thus decides to offer the boar painting to the winner of the competition as it is worthless without the other two paintings. Conan and the Detective Boys attend to watch the competition after hearing Genta's father making past the preliminary rounds as one of the three finalists. When it is announced the competition is canceled, Conan notices the announcer has blood on his sleeve and investigates. Conan finds out the host has been murdered by being pushed down the stairs whilst fighting over a piece of paper.\n\nSince the three finalists were the only ones on that floor at the time the three, including Genta's father, are the primary suspects.\nThe police interrogate the three finalists and learn all three culprits share the same shoe size, voice, and were all left handed. When a gun is found in Gonsaku's bag, Gonsaku's servant reveals that the gang, Hyakki Yakō, invaded Gonsaku's house, stole the deer and butterfly paintings, and murdered Gonsaku's dog. During the invasion, Gonsaku is spared due to the gang's leader sharing the same surname as Gonsaku, Kojima. Conan deduces Gonsaku hosted the competition in order to search for the gang's leader. Conan realizes Gonsaku figured out who the leader of the gang was due to the final competition where the contenders must read a single kanji written on a piece of paper.\n",
