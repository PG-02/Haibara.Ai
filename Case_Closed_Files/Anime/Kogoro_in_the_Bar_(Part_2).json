    "Situation": "Kogoro is undercover at the Blue Parrot, because Yuzuki Fukui asked him to investigate on a weird sound she hears frequently. Conan joins him, saying that Ran is angry because Kogoro is not home. But a simple investigation in a bar becomes more dramatic when Chikafumi Usuda, an office worker, is found dead.\n\n",
    "People": "- 26 years old\n- Blue Parrot bartender\n- Victim (poison)\n- 51 years old\n- Office worker (department manager)\n- 30 years old\n- Office worker\n- 31 years old\n- Office worker\n- 28 years old\n- Office worker\n- Deceased (hanged)\n- Office worker\n- Tokyo MPD CSI officer\n",
    "Resolution": "",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga, Kogoro uses the gimlet as an example of alcohol cocktails containing citrus fruits, while in the anime the examples were Gin, screwdriver and the white lady which may be foreshadowing from the anime to future names of the Black Organization that Gosho Aoyama didn't want to reveal.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The title for this case appears to be a reference to a 2011 Japanese hardboiled mystery film The Detective Is in the Bar (探偵はBARにいる), which is based on the eponymous novel written by Naomi Azusa. Incidentally, the protagonist for the aforementioned film and novel is the featured detective for volume 81.\n- The murder location Blue Parrot Pool Bar appears to be the billiards hall owned by Konosuke Jii, a character from Magic Kaito. Its name and appearance matches the one shown in the Magic Kaito Chapter Midnight Crow.\n- Yuzu is a citrus fruit mostly cultivated in East Asia, and believed to have originated in Central China. It has recently been cultivated in the following countries: Australia, Spain, Italy and France as well.\n- The names of the suspects are related to \"citrus\"[2] :\nYuzuki Fukui (福井 柚嬉) comes from the \"yuzu lemon\" (柚子) ;\nChikafumi Usuda (薄田 周史) comes from the \"sudachi lime\" (酢橘) ;\nMika Kishiura (岸浦 実夏) comes from the \"Kishu mikan mandarin orange\" (紀州蜜柑) ;\nKensaku Hatsumura (初村 健策) comes from the \"hassaku orange\" (八朔) ;\nMonpei Kogure (小暮 紋平) comes from \"lemons\" (レモン ,remon?) ;\nYoshikuwa (吉桑) comes from the \"shiikwāsā lemon (シークヮーサー).\n- Yuzuki Fukui (福井 柚嬉) comes from the \"yuzu lemon\" (柚子) ;\n- Chikafumi Usuda (薄田 周史) comes from the \"sudachi lime\" (酢橘) ;\n- Mika Kishiura (岸浦 実夏) comes from the \"Kishu mikan mandarin orange\" (紀州蜜柑) ;\n- Kensaku Hatsumura (初村 健策) comes from the \"hassaku orange\" (八朔) ;\n- Monpei Kogure (小暮 紋平) comes from \"lemons\" (レモン ,remon?) ;\n- Yoshikuwa (吉桑) comes from the \"shiikwāsā lemon (シークヮーサー).\n- Yuzuki Fukui (福井 柚嬉) comes from the \"yuzu lemon\" (柚子) ;\n- Chikafumi Usuda (薄田 周史) comes from the \"sudachi lime\" (酢橘) ;\n- Mika Kishiura (岸浦 実夏) comes from the \"Kishu mikan mandarin orange\" (紀州蜜柑) ;\n- Kensaku Hatsumura (初村 健策) comes from the \"hassaku orange\" (八朔) ;\n- Monpei Kogure (小暮 紋平) comes from \"lemons\" (レモン ,remon?) ;\n- Yoshikuwa (吉桑) comes from the \"shiikwāsā lemon (シークヮーサー).\n",
