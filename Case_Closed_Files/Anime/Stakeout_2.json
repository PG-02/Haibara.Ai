    "Situation": "After seeing a window with open blinds, Conan, Haibara, and the Detective Boys discovered Takagi and Chiba were on another stakeout. Their goal was also to observe the building across from them. This time being a woman named Satomi Yoda. She was being watched by the police due to her ex, Kazuma Fujiki, who happened to be involved in a robbery case from days ago. That is, a middle-aged man was knocked unconscious with a rod-like object during a robbery, and according to the crime scene situation, the police were convinced that the culprit was Fujiki.\n\nAlthough he is still at large and on the run, the police got some valuable information from a bar named Fukunishi. The bar owner claimed that he once heard Fujiki say stuff like: \"his ex is still loving her and wants to have a reunion.\" Takagi and Chiba thus questioned Yoda about whether Fujiki had contacted her after he committed the crime, she denied the fact and promised to contact them when Fujiki phoned her. Takagi did not believe her words and, therefore, decided to surveillance her.\nJust after Takagi had explained the situation, they heard Yoda's sighs from her balcony: \"What should I do?\" After that, she seemed to get a phone call from someone, and she got shocked after hearing the content. After some communication, she hurried to get dressed and rushed out of her house. Conan and Takagi decided to follow her and see her act. They found out that she went to the shopping mall and bought some food: high-grade steak, assorted sashimi, top-quality broiled eel, shortcakes, and some wine. After that, she withdrew some cash from an ATM. Takagi deduced that she was probably doing all of these things for his ex, hence, she still had some feelings for him. Suddenly, she phoned Takagi, and asked everyone to gather at her house because she had decided to confess everything. The truth turned out to be a coincidence, after Takagi and Chiba had questioned her and left her house, Fujiki contacted her, saying he was about to hide in her apartment, but owing to the presence of the police, he fled away timidly. The money and food were just a gimmick to make the police believe that Fujiki was coming to her home after she knew she was being watched. But eventually, she thought permitting her ex to consistently stay on the run was not the best choice, and she would recommend him atone for his sins. After confessing everything, she burst out in tears. Takagi also comprehended the reality, thus, he decided to retrieve the stakeout plan after Fujiki alone.\nThe Detective Boys follows the two policemen into a convenience store that was situated nearby Yoda's home. They viewed the security footage together and found Fujiki's face in the image. Combining with the timestamp, it was apparently on his way to Yoda's home in the morning, however, they did not discover the scenario he left Yoda's house. Afterwards, the Detective Boys investigated more clues regarding the case: Yoda used to be a joyful person, but after she broke up with Fujiki, she fell into the abyss of depression. Just last month, Yoda engaged with a man called Daisuke Ishinabe, who ran a general store called \"Ishinabe Discount\". He was precisely meeting Yoda at that time. \"I see, that woman's confession must have been a lie.\" Conan understood everything and was about to uncover the truth in front of Yoda. On the other hand, Ishinabe was helping Yoda carry some used books in a rectangular box into a van. Because the books were too heavy, she needed Ishinabe's help. Ishinabe left the van key and greeted Yoda. Conan then emerged from the back of the van and started his deduction.\n",
    "People": "- 25 years old\n- Unemployed\n- Satomi's ex-fiancé\n- 25 years old\n- Office worker\n- 30 years old\n- \"Ishinabe Discount\" general store owner\n- Satomi's fiancé\n- Bar Fukunishi bartender\n- Pedestrian\n- Asking to borrow some money from woman\n- Pedestrian\n- Tussling with man\n- MAWSOW convenience store clerk\n",
    "Resolution": "After Fujiki injured the middle-aged man in a robbery during the morning, he decided to flee into Yoda's apartment and pleaded with her to hide him in her apartment, in order to preclude the police's arrest. But, Satomi Yoda, who could not endure the man's selfishness for ditching her three years ago, killed him with a flower pot. To resume the engagement with Ishinabe meanwhile not to be suspected by the police, the only thing she could do was to dispose of the corpse somewhere else. Even if the police discovered the corpse, she would be off the suspect circle as she broke up with Fujiki a long time ago. Unfortunately, when she was just about to place the corpse in the rectangular box, her access control rang, and Takagi and Chiba went to question her regarding Fujiki's robbery. With the police doing a stakeout on the other side, she could not make any suspicious acts, therefore, the \"what should I do?\" remarked by her was not her panicking on whether she should accept Fujiki's stay but an exclamation concerning how to dispose of Fujiki's corpse. She suddenly came up with quick wits to make an illusion that Fujiki called her and told her about his arrival, so she then pretended to buy food for him and withdraw money for him, lastly she made a fake confession to the police. She did that not only to call off the stakeout, but also to reduce her suspicion. She demonstrated to the police that she was willing to deceive them to help Fujiki escape, this implied that she still had feelings for Fujiki, so the police would never consider her murdering Fujiki or even throwing the corpse of his.\nYoda praised Conan's deduction, but she pointed out that he got one important thing wrong. Fujiki's death happened to be an accidental death. Fujiki indeed entered Yoda's apartment in the morning, and Yoda then served him a cup of water. He was not satisfied and inquired for beer. He called Yoda inconsiderate and threw the cup on the ground, looking rather indignant. Yoda reluctantly brought beer to Fujiki, but as the bar owner said, he is such a self-centered guy that he always thinks his ex still loves him. So he made several unreasonably arrogant remarks that finally enraged Yoda, who roared at him and asked him to leave. Fujiki could not stand that remark and slipped the beer bottles on the floor as well. On his way out, he carelessly stepped on the beer bottle he had just thrown away, and his head hit the corner of a mesa. Yoda thought if her neighbors gave testimonies about hearing her argue with the victim, the police would arrest her immediately, so she decided to toss the corpse somewhere.\n\n",
