    "Situation": "Kogoro and horse bettors Susumu Nakamura, Chihiro Ohgi, and Masao Shinohara gather in Satsuki Mishima's bar, one with no leg room and with a crack in the rusty wall. Everyone then leaves the bar around the same time to attend to personal matters. Kogoro takes a smoking break, Nakamura goes to buy cigarettes, Ohgi to the public restroom, Shinohara to the ATM. When they regroup, they find Satsuki slouching over the counter on a swivel chair.\n\nShinohara tries to wake her up, only to find a knife in her chest. Kogoro assumes that during the break, someone had a fight with Satsuki who was behind the counter, and stabbed her in the front. The evidence left on the scene does not support it.\n",
