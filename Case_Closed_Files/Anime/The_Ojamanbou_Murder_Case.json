    "Resolution": "Another piece of evidence is that the harmonica that the victim was supposedly picking up did not have any fingerprints from the victim nor the murderer.\nHideyuki had panicked, when Ran had unknowingly blocked the mirror he was using as a result he dropped the steel beam prematurely, before the victim had a chance to pick up the harmonica.\nHis motive was that Tsunehisa had broken up with Hideyuki's sister, causing her to quit Ojamanbou and suffer a fatal accident while working at a construction site in Yokohama. He learned about this through his sister's diary and along with Tsunehisa's Harmonica, that he decided it to use it to kill him in the process.\n",
