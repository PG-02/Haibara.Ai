    "Situation": "Sonoko's uncle named Jirokichi Suzuki wants to capture Kaitou Kid to improve his fame, by Kaitou Kid to see if he can steal the jewel called, \"Blue Wonder\", in reality Jirokichi wants to use it as bait. He sent a message to Kid saying, \"Attention Kaitou Kid. I challenge you: I've put the priceless artifact Blue Wonder atop my museum in the city. Come and take it if you can.\" Later, Kaitou Kid accepts Jirokichi's challenge and will steal the Blue Wonder.\nThat night, Nakamori and the police are waiting for Kaitou Kid to come. The helicopters are flying around the museum. Kid arrives on the scene and seemingly walks on air to investigate the treasure he will steal. Conan investigates and finds out the trick Kaitou Kid used. The second time Kaitou Kid tried to steal the jewel but it was revealed to be a distraction.\n",
