After realizing he has deduced and given her the wrong location, Kogoro tries calling her home number but realize she gave him a fake number. Kogoro call her cellphone number and she picks up. Kogoro gives her the correct location, Bell Tree Tower, to Kaori.\nConan finds her suspicious and figures out Kaori's real home phone number then calls it. He's surprised when Sato begins talking to him on the phone and the group discovers that a gun (Nambu Taisho 14) is missing from Kaori's home.\nThey find out that Mitsuhei Nagai, Kaori's ex-boyfriend that two-timed her, and his fiancé Misato Taniguchi are going to be at Bell Tree Tower, and then realize her motive for going there is revenge. Kogoro, Conan, Ran, Sato, and Takagi all rush there to stop her. As a last ditch effort, Conan sends her a text message, hoping it would change her mind.\nThey arrive at the party and start looking for her, they spot someone that looks similar to her and chase after her thinking that she's Kaori, but Conan spots the real Kaori and follows her. Kaori walks up to the stage where her ex-boyfriend and fiancé are and seemingly starts pulling out the gun.\n\n",
