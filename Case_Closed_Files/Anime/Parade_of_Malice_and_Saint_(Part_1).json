Takagi's disguise causes Sato to experience traumatic flashbacks and she resultantly slaps Takagi. The other officers reveal Takagi's disguise resembles Sato's dead partner, Matsuda. During the parade, the bomber detonates an explosive hidden under Takagi's Gray GT-R; Takagi luckily was able to avoid the explosion.\n\n\nAfter a through investigation, Conan realizes that the mail truck never arrived and realizes the explosion was a distraction and what the true motives for the bombers are.\n",

    "Trivia": "- This is the sixth case of the Metropolitan Police Detective Love Story (series), however it is the second hidden one, by not having the Metropolitan Police Detective Love Story in the name. The first was The Shinkansen Transport Case.\n- When they are talking about the bombings of three years ago, they are probably talking about The Trembling Police Headquarters: 12 Million Hostages case, which happens to be the third hidden case in the series.\n- This is Miwako Sato's third case to wear a disguise. The first two were Megure's Sealed Secret and Boy Genta's Misfortune, however in this case she wore two disguises.\n- This is the case that Takagi, unknowingly, wore a disguise that resembled Jinpei Matsuda, Sato's late partner, which may have been his first ever disguise too.\n- This is the first case that Haibara is shown using her Detective Boys Badge.\n",
