    "Situation": "It was the 4th year of the Sengoku Era. On that fateful night, the slandered Hidetomo Okiname requested an audience with his tyrannical master, Genbu Ohara, pleading with him to cease his incessant harassment. However, that only served to anger Genbu, resulting in the annihilation of the entire Okiname family. In despair over his loss, Hidetomo donned his armor, cut down Genbu, and committed suicide by slitting his own throat. There's a legend which says that Hidetomo's spirit wanders about to this day, and that those who encounter him will meet an untimely end. Therefore, the Hidetomo Festival was created, intending to calm his vengeful spirit. Incidentally, payment from the previous owner included a replica of the helmet that Hidetomo wore as he committed suicide. That day marks the 500th anniversary of Hidetomo's death.\nKogoro, Ran, and Conan are driving to a hot spring in a certain countryside outside Tokyo when the road gets closed due to snow, and so they accept an offer of staying the night at a nearby house, where they meet the famous guitarist Yoshiro Daimon, his older brother Kazuki Daimon, their housekeeper Hatsuho Hojo, Kazuki's wife Kayoko Daimon, Daimon Industries president Genichiro Daimon, and his wife Tatsuko Daimon.\nTatsuko Daimon gives her son Yoshiro Daimon a notebook with saved articles from the past. Yoshiro gives Kogoro an article to read, which is about the suicide of Keiichi Saegusa, the president of Saegusa industries.\n\nThe next day they discover the dead body of the company president.\n\nWhen they follow the footprints, they find his eldest son dressed up in armor and also dead in a locked room.\n\nThe company president's wife declares that they were killed by the spirit of that 500-year-old samurai, in the day of his death anniversary.\nAs requested by his mother, Yoshiro is the only person left who can protect that house, then he must left forever his guitarist's work. Conan discovers that the footprints of the armor in the snow were used to cover up the culprit's footprints, and finds that the locked room in which the son died was set up.\n",

    "Resolution": "Recalling the katana lying on the floor in the audio room. When they first saw it, they jumped to the conclusion that it was used only as a weapon. However, the katana wasn't just a weapon. It had another particularly sneaky purpose: to turn the audio room into a locked room. After the culprit killed Kazuki, they dressed him in the armor, then stabbed the katana into the wall near the door. Then, with the other end of the katana they rested it upon the door handle, then slowly but surely exited the room without letting the katana fall and used the force of the closing door to make the katana bolt the lock with this the sealed room was complete. They knew that no one would have the strength to open the dead-bolted door and they also knew that trying to break the door down would cause the katana to fall to the floor, leaving the trick would unexposed or so the culprit thought.\nBefore that, they must analyze the significance of the case happening on the anniversary of Hidetomo's death. The culprit took advantage of the legend and left those large footprints to make it seem as though the only possible culprit was the armored warrior, and fool them into believing Kazuki killed Genichiro and committed suicide shortly thereafter. To make this more believable, the culprit purposely directed Tatsuko, who strongly believed in the legend, to bear witness to the animated suit of armor. Being the anniversary of Hidetomo's death, everyone knew that Tatsuko would be praying at the altar at exactly 12:00 AM. Since she couldn't see the katana from her position, it means that the culprit is left-handed.\nThe culprit is Hatsuho Hojo. After that, he shows a picture that shows Hatsuho, when she was a graduated highschool student in sailor suit, and her father, who is revealed to be Keiichi Saegusa, the president of Saegusa industries who committed suicide.\nThe proof is the the pair of socks that were later found hidden in the kitchen stove. The socks that Tatsuko left on the altar the previous night disappeared, and weren't found on the corpse. So why were they taken? After killing Genichiro, Hojo stepped on the broken glass from when he dropped it, injuring her foot. If she wore the armor's shoes with that wound, there would be a stain. To avoid that, she took the socks from the altar and put them on. She intended to dispose of them the next day, since no one else would be using the kitchen, but Ran ended up coming in to help her with the coffee, so the opportunity to do so was lost.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is the last Detective Conan case written by screenwriter Chiaki Hashiba. It was aired one year after her death, therefore the other screenwriter, Fumiko Komatsuzaki, was probably responsible for completing the unfinished part of the story.\n- The Sengoku Era is the period from 1467-1573 in which the then separate Japanese tribes constantly fought for separation or unification from each other, unlike the American Civil War. The 4th year was 1470, 531 and not 500 years before the episode's airdate.\n",

    "Quotes": "- Sleeping Kogoro:\n. Do you think your father is happy that you avenged his death? Do you think he'd praise you? , it wasn't Hidetomo's spirit that put that suit of armour on. You heart wore the suit of armour, the cold armour called revenge.  (初穂さん、お父さんの復讐を果たしたことで—あなたのお父さんは喜んでいるでしょうか？よくやったと褒めてくれるでしょうか？初穗さん、鎧を着けていたのは秀友の亡霊なんかじゃない、あなたの心が。鎧を着けてしまっていたんです、復讐という名の冷たい鎧を。)\n"
