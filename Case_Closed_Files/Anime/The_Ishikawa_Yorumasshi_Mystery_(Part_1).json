    "Resolution": "The person seen in the footage was not Jotaro as he always carries the guitar on his right shoulder while in the footage, the person was holding on his left shoulder.\nThe truth is Kinomoto was the one who sent the letter to Domon, however, it was cut in half by Domon and sent to Arihara, it was meant so that Arihara would find the other members, but she ended up asking Mori for help. When Domon realized that the letter was sent by Kinomoto, he attempted to kill him to hide the proof but ended up almost killing Conan and Inami in the process.\nThe sleeping Kogoro reveals that Domon broke into Kinomoto’s studio to steal the video, which contains the footage against him and then placed the guitar’s box in Jotaro’s car to accuse him but accidentally left some gold pieces in the box and his shoes as well. He accidentally admits the crime when he says that the car was old, which he’d only seen when he sabotaged it.\nHe attempts to escape, however, Conan uses his elastical suspender, combined with the golden skateboard given by Inami to follow Domon along, eventually forcing him to brake and crashing to the ground. Then the group reunited with Inami as their new drummer.\nConan and Ran are eating together on the train while Conan wonders about the local police, which includes Kansuke, Yui and Taka’aki along while Mori is enjoying the food outside the train and he is accidentally left outside.\n",
