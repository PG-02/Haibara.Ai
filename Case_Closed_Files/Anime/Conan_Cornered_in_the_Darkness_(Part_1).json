    "Situation": "Kogoro is invited to the funeral for Gotaro Karahashi, the late chairman of Karahashi Group, and is asked by his lawyer Kimihiko Asada to investigate a robbery and break in that took place in his office. He reveals that an altered last will of Karahashi had been stolen.\n\n\nAfter Conan regains consciousness, he finds himself in a dark and cramped place he uses his detective to badge to call the others for help. He initially believed that he was stashed beneath a coffin, as a result Ran and the kids rush to a crematorium just in time before President Karahashi is cremated. However when they check the coffin Conan is no where to be found.\nConan eventually deduces that he is actually inside a hearse, he looks around and finds the altered last will had been stashed away with him. He guides the others as best as he can in the hopes that they find him, as the hearse is set to be demolished as a car crusher. Eventually the others locate him just in time to witness the hearse being crushed, and apparently Conan along with it.\nThey are all in shock, but then Conan emerges unscathed from wreckage much to their relief. A flashback reveals that in the last few moments he managed to escape because the door was weakened when the hearse was being crushed. Using his super kick shoes he kicks the doors off and escapes at the last second before the hearse is completely crushed.\n\n",
    "People": "- Deceased (illness)\n- Karahashi Group's chairman\n- 55 years old\n- Lawyer\n- Gotaro's notary\n- 38 years old\n- Gotaro's eldest son\n- Karahashi family head\n- 32 years old\n- Gotaro's middle daughter\n- 28 years old\n- Gotaro's youngest son\n- Gotaro's private secretary and lover\n- Altered testament's apparent beneficiary\n- Kuriniji Scrapyard worker\n- Taxi driver\n",
    "Resolution": "The culprits in this case are Gotaro Karahashi's own children: Kozo, Mitsuyo, and Eisuke. Conan after managing to escape from the wreckage, had also managed to save the altered last will as well. There were two pieces of evidence proving their guilt: the first being some traces of gum on Conan’s broken cellphone as one of the siblings had gum under his shoe, the second is the last will itself it has all the siblings fingerprints as they had supposedly no idea what the altered will said yet their fingerprints were all over the will.\nFaced with this evidence they confess that they worked in concert to get rid of their father's altered last will, which would have left them with no inheritance. This disgusts Ran and she berates the siblings for putting Conan's life in danger over a stupid alternation of a will.\nHearing this put the siblings in shock as they had almost unintentionally murdered an innocent child for their greed. Later on, it is revealed that Gotaro had left his entire inheritance to his secretary and lover, but she decides to donate the entire inheritance to charity instead.\n",
    "Trivia": "- In the New Year Greeting to the viewers, Mistuhiko says that last year, Conan and Ichikawa Ebizo XI were the ones to do the New Year Greeting. This is a reference to Conan and Ebizo's Kabuki Jūhachiban Mystery.\n- Conan's phone says Ony instead of Sony.\n- When Haibara looks up Beika City Crematoriums, on the internet it shows Glegle instead of Google.\n- There is a mistake in the first episode. In the earlier scene, Mitsuyo has the white and black shoes but Kozo's feet does not. Later all three siblings have on the white and black shoes. This is an important detail because the culprit wore this distinctive pair of shoes in Conan's flashback of him being kidnapped.\n- The sunset painting in Mitsuyo's house is from Wakamatsu villa in The Design of Poison and Mirage and Kataoka household in The Secret of the Statue of Kogoro Mouri, while the one about flowers in Karahashi Group's lobby reappears in Mori family's former apartment from Memories from Sakura Class and in the house from Picking Wild Plants and Clovers.
