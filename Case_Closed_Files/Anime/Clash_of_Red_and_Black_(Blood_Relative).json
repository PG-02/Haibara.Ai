    "Plot": "",
    "The Beginning (Manga: 585-586, Anime: 491)": "Conan, Ran, and Sonoko are visiting a sick friend in the hospital. There they meet Eisuke who tells them he is searching for his long lost sister who looks identical to Rena Mizunashi. Eisuke explains that his sister intended to become a nurse so he is searching the local hospitals for her. Conan, however, suspects Eisuke knows Rena has been hospitalized due to her accident. Eisuke then explains that his sister always saved his life at hospitals. Before he lost contact with her, she had donated blood to him, after he had been in an accident in Osaka. Then he further says that he wants to find her and thank her. Conan decides to consider that Eisuke might be telling the truth, that he is looking for his sister. The three decide to visit Kōshi Anno, a big fan of Rena, to confirm whether Rena is actually Eisuke's sister. Unable to contact Kōshi, they visit his mother and learn Kōshi recently called asking for money in order to pay off a rival company in a business meeting later that day.\n\n- Kogoro's mahjong friend\n- Rena Mizunashi's fan\n- Koshi Anno's mother\n- Koshi Anno's miniature dachshund\n- Remittance scam fraudster\n- Arrested\n- Anno's real dog\n- Miniature Daschhund\n\n\n",
    "Deceased Mother's Memento (Manga: 586-590, Anime: 492-494)": "Koshi confirms that the picture is indeed Rena and shows them a news recording depicting Rena with the same hairstyle as Eisuke's sister's in the photograph. In the video, they learn that Rena's blood type is AB. Eisuke denies that Rena is his sister since his sister's blood was once used for his blood transfusion; Eisuke has blood type O, meaning he can only receive Type O blood. Conan suspects there is a hidden component to Eisuke's story and believes Eisuke is searching for Rena with an ulterior motive. Conan calls Jodie to warn her about Eisuke and learns that Rena's blood type indeed is AB. But Agasa brings out a point that since Eisuke was a child when he got the blood transfusion, he might have misunderstood the situation. Conan agrees that he has to have it confirmed that Eisuke's sister really did donated blood and also what Eisuke's blood type is, before he can do anything. The next day, Eisuke invites Ran and Sonoko to accompany him to the mansion he used to live in to collect his mother's belongings which were recently found. Kogoro, coincidentally, was also hired to investigate a murder at the mansion that occurred a year ago. Once there, Eisuke finds his birth certificate, confirming that he has blood type O. Meanwhile, Kogoro is with the owner of the mansion, Kakuzo Okudaira, discussing the murder of his son, Tango Okudaira. Kakuzo tells Kogoro he suspects the murderer is one of three people in the mansion.\n\n\n\nKakuzo shows Kogoro a photograph of Tango's body in a pool and points to a white glove Tango is wearing. He reveals that the glove was the same glove their previous butler wore before a car accident killed him, and that Tango's murder occurred on the anniversary of the butler's death. Kakuzo tells Kogoro that, three days after Tango's death, he received a white glove and now presumes the murderer plans to kill him next. After the discussion, Kogoro and Conan investigate the house searching for clues. When a blackout occurs and the sound of a vase is heard from Kakuzo's room, they arrive to find him hanged. Conan investigates and realizes three suspicious points: glue was used to keep the knot of the rope together, the broken vase with sweat near the top, and a book titled \"Killer of Hades\" (in kanji) with blood on it. The police declare that if the book is a dying message, the murderer must be one of the three suspects.\nConan's investigation leads him to realize how Kakuzo and Tango's murder was accomplished.\n- Deceased\n- Eisuke Hondou's mother\n- Okudaira mansion former housekeeper\n- Victim (hanged)\n- 63 years old\n- Okudaira family head\n- Deceased (drowned)\n- Kakuzo Okudaira's son\n- 56 years old\n- Kakuzo Okudaira's second wife\n- 39 years old\n- Housekeeper\n- 48 years old\n- Butler\n- Deceased former butler's younger brother\n- Deceased (car accident)\n- Died two years ago in car accident at cliff\n- Okudaira mansion former butler\n- Hataro Segawa's older brother\n\n\n",
    "Fake Patient (Manga: 595-598, Anime: 495-497)": "Kogoro shuts up crows, because they're perching on the third-floor railing again, while he watched Yoko Okino's TV program who sings like a bird. Conan learns from Ran that she had been unable to contact Eisuke since the winter break. She tells him Eisuke last told her that he had found someone from his father's company at Haido Central Hospital, the same hospital in which Rena is currently hospitalized. Conan contacts Jodie Starling to inform her Eisuke may be searching for Rena and learns from her that Eisuke's father, Ethan Hondou, was a spy for the CIA who were investigating the Black Organization. She reveals that Rena and the Black Organization murdered him four years ago. So it seems unlikely that Rena should be Eisuke's sister, because that would mean that she killed her own father. Haibara suspects that Rena impersonated Hondou's daughter to spy on the C.I.A.s investigation of the organization, but was uncovered. Conan phones Ran asking her how Eisuke recognized the colleague. She replies that Eisuke recognized the person through the phones keypad tone which played the song \"Nanatsu no Ko\", the phone number of the Black Organization's leader. Conan realizes that a Black Organization member is in Haido Central Hospital. Fearing that the criminal syndicate may be close to finding Rena, Conan and the FBI investigate the hospital. After asking a nurse about a suspicious person, the FBI narrows the suspects list to hospitalized patients between December 18 and December 21 and begin their search for the Black Organization member.\n\nThe nurse tells Conan that she just remembered Eisuke had surgery for leukemia when he was young, raising the possibility Rena may in fact be his sister. Meanwhile, the FBI manages to narrow the list of suspects down to three patients: An old man with a broken leg, a man with a neck sprain, and a man with dorsalgia. Conan volunteers to secretly investigate them. After recording the three patients on a secret camera, Conan reports back to the FBI.\n- Possible Black Organization spy\n- Hospitalized for bone fracture in right leg\n- Possible Black Organization spy\n- Hospitalized for cervical spine sprain\n- Possible Black Organization spy\n- Hospitalized for acute lower back pain\n- Haido Central Hospital nurse\n- Questioned about Eisuke and new patient\n- Remembers Eisuke's past leukemia operation\n- Haido Central Hospital director\n- Friend of James Black who rescued him from a ruffian\n- Haido Central Hospital nurse\n- FBI agent disguised as a Haido Central Hospital nurse\nThat night Kusuda is caught sneaking into the nurse's lounge photographing the patient list and the FBI proceed to apprehend him. Kusuda reveals that under his cervical collar are explosives which he will detonate if they attempt to arrest him. He flees from the hospital in a car but is pursued by Conan and Akai. Kusuda kills himself with his own gun before being caught. While the FBI attempt to figure out how to keep the Black Organization away from Rena, Akai decides they must keep the hospital employees uninvolved and that he shall think of plan to ambush them. Later that night, Eisuke sneaks into Rena's room and attempts to question her about his sister. Frustrated with her comatose state, he attempts to stab her with scissors but she grabs his hand and stops him.\n\n\n",
    "Last Resort (Manga: 600-604, Anime: 498-500)": "The FBI plan on transporting Rena to another location in one of three identical vans, making the other two decoys. Later that day, James Black receives a flower from the deceased Kusada.\n\nElsewhere, the Black Organization cause food poisoning throughout restaurants in the city, release poisonous gas (virus infection) in public areas (train station), and start a fire in a local theatre. These incidents cause a large amount of people needing medical attention to flow into the hospital. While Conan and Akai attempt to deduce the Black Organization plans, they notice a ticking sound from Jame's flower pot and realize there is a bomb in it. Agent Andre Camel and Jodie are given the task to detonate the bomb in an isolated location. After doing so, Akai notices there is a rush of deliveries to patients and realize they also contain explosives sent by the Black Organization.\nRena appears on television while the FBI agents are gathering the small explosives which causes them to gather to Rena's room to investigate. They realize it was part of the Black Organization's plan as the explosives the agents were collecting contained transmitters; Gin, who watches the transmitters gather in a single location, tells his colleagues of Rena's location in the hospital. The FBI initiate their plan to transport Rena to another location. Camel is given the task of transporting Rena while the other FBI agents become decoys in the other two vans. Jodie suspects Camel is part of the organization and attempts to pursue Camel to give her the task of driving the van with Rena. Camel incapacitates her and hides her body. The three vans drive off with Chianti, Korn, and Vodka stalking them. Using thermal vision devices, they are able to see through the vans and upload the images to Gin who attempts to deduce which truck contains Rena. Vermouth follows Akai who is secretly tailing the second van, causing them to believe the truck Korn is stalking contains Rena. However, Gin stops them and reveals that Rena is in the van Camel is driving, the one being stalked by Vodka.\nRena wakes up and knocks Camel unconscious, causing the car to crash. Once freed, she reunites with the other members of the Black Organization.\n\nChianti prepares to kill Camel, but the vehicle explodes, attracting the attention of the public and forcing the Black Organization members to flee.\n\n\n",
    "Friday the Thirteenth (Manga: 605-609, Anime: 501-504)": "Back in the present time, Rena asks Gin to spare the hospital and its employees, causing Gin to suspect her of being disloyal to the organization. Elsewhere, Professor Agasa takes the Detective Boys to a hotel restaurant. They run into Detective Takagi who tells them the president of a foreign talent agency was murdered only a few minutes ago.\n\nTakagi tells them that the suspect is an unknown foreigner who had an appointment with the president. Conan tells him that the suspect must be in the hotel still since the president's office is on the top floor and—with so little time—the suspect would not have had enough time to rid himself of the smell of gunpowder and escape the building. The police gather up three foreign suspects, one of which includes FBI Agent Camel. Camel is the prime suspect because of his physical features and refusal to answer the questions relating to his profession since the FBI's investigation in Japan must remain a secret. Conan calls Jodie to come and help prove Camel's innocence.\nJodie arrives and tells the police that Camel is an FBI agent and that they are a couple vacationing in Japan. The police continue the investigation and notice that a memo with the words \"Bring my Tux\" was ripped out by an unknown culprit. Jodie asks Camel why he was in Japan two years ago. He replies that he was on a mission with Akai to investigate the Black Organization. He tells her that in the past, he made a mistake and exposed Akai's identity as an FBI agent to the syndicate and impeded Akai's mission as a spy. This indirectly resulted in the Organization murdering Akai's love, Akemi Miyano. Elsewhere, Gin orders Rena to set up a meeting with Akai or be branded as a traitor and subsequently killed. He tells her that he will plant a bug on her during the meeting and that it is her duty to kill Akai. Akai receives a call from Rena and agrees to meet with her, knowing that it is an ambush set up to take his life.\nConan realizes why the culprit took the memo and tells Inspector Megure his plan to reveal the culprit.\n- Victim (gunshot)\n- 51 years old\n- Talent agency company president\n- 24 years old\n- Sunouchi's secretary\n- 27 years old\n- Recruited talent\n- 28 years old\n- English tutor\n- FBI Agent\n- Black's subordinate\n- Black Organization member\n- 46 years old\n- Nichiuri news real-life announcer\n\nAkai meets with Rena who shoots him in the chest. He notices Gin's car in the distance and accepts his death so Rena may continue to spy from within the Black Organization. Rena shoots Akai in the head and places his body in his Pick-Up Truck with an timed explosive and leaves the scene. Once the bomb detonates, it catches the attention of the authorities and later the media who reports that a body burned beyond recognition was found. The FBI realize that the unidentified body belongs to Akai. Jodie heads to the police station to confirm Akai's death. She gives them Conan's cellphone which contains Akai's fingerprint so they could compare it to the body. The police confirm that a fingerprint found on the phone matched the body and Conan's cellphone is confiscated as evidence. Jodie gives Conan a phone of the same model as a replacement without informing him. Conan, having realized the change in the serial number, realizes Akai had died.\n- Tokyo MPD police officer\n- Found Akai's body\n",
    "Resolution": "",
    "Character background revelations": "- Eisuke Hondou was revealed to be the biological brother of Rena Mizunashi who's real name is Hidemi Hondou. He had leukemia as a child and was given a bone marrow transplant from Hidemi. As a consequence, his blood type changed from O to AB. He is cleared of any residual suspicion of being involved with or followed by the Black Organization.\n- Hidemi Hondou admits to being a CIA agent on a mission to infiltrate the Black Organization. Her \"running away from home\" and overseas schooling was a cover story for her CIA training.\n- Hidemi Hondou reveals her father, Ethan Hondou, was also a CIA agent on the same mission. Although it seemed like Hidemi killed her father, the truth was that Hidemi made a mistake, so her father commits suicide in a way that makes it look like Hidemi killed him for being a traitor in order to fool the Black Organization and rescue her. As a consequence, Hidemi gains the trust of the boss and is able to ascend the Black Organization's ranks.\n- Shuichi Akai infiltrated the Black Organization five years prior to the current timeline using the alias Dai Moroboshi and dated Akemi Miyano, one of their low-ranking members, in order to meet Shiho Miyano and use her influence to get into the Black Organization.[1] Although at first he was simply using Akemi as a tool, they both fell in love with each other. Akai distinguished himself as an agent and two years prior to the current timeline received the codename Rye and was called to work under executive agent Gin. The FBI laid a trap hoping to capture Gin at a warehouse where the meeting was supposed to take place,[1] but Andre Camel made a mistake causing the Black Organization to discover Akai's true allegiance.[2] Akai is still in love with Akemi Miyano and wants to get revenge for her murder. Her last text message to Akai contained a confession of love to him, and an unrevealed P.S.\n- Andre Camel is revealed to be an FBI agent loyal to Akai who feels a debt to Shuichi Akai for ruining his infiltration of the Black Organization and the FBI's chances to capture Gin two years ago. As it was his mistake that got Akai ousted and led to Akai's girlfriend, Akemi Miyano, being killed later he volunteers for the dangerous role of transporting Kir in order to make amends.\n",
    "Important event summaries": "- Conan and Shuichi Akai confront Black Organization member Rikumichi Kusuda. Although the FBI fail to apprehend him in the hospital, he commits suicide when he discovers Akai is chasing him.\n- Conan and Akai use Eisuke to force Hidemi into revealing she was really conscious and strike a bargain with her to help her return to the Black Organization if she will share intelligence with the FBI as well. At this time, Eisuke learns his sister is a CIA agent on the trail of a large organization, but is not allowed to hear any more information.\n- Conan, Akai, and Camel safely execute a plan that returns Hidemi to the Black Organization while making it looked like the FBI failed to protect her. She convinces the Organization that Haido Central Hospital Staff were not involved so that civilian harm is avoided.\n- In order to clear suspicions about how easy it was to reclaim her, the boss, through Gin, orders Kir to call out Shuichi Akai and kill him. She does so, shooting Akai in the lung and head while Gin and Vodka watch on camera.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga, it was never mentioned how Akai and Akemi first met. But in episode 497, it was shown in a flashback that Shuichi Akai originally met Akemi by an intentional accident. She accidentally hit him with her car when he deliberately walked into the street in front of her in order to be hit by her.\n- In the manga, Kusuda's gun resembles a Glock pistol. However, in episode 497, it resembles more of a M1911 model pistol.\n- In the manga, there is a scene in which a Black Organization guard is spying on Kir when she is confronted by Gin. However, in episode 502, this scene is omitted from the anime.\n- Akai's face after he was killed by Kir was only shown once in the anime instead of twice like the manga, presumably because of the violence and blood. The two panels of Akai's face in the manga showed that Akai's head moved and his face became clean while Kir stepped away from the truck. The anime's censorship made this much more difficult to notice.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The anime reordered several cases in the making of Clash of Red and Black. In the manga, The Devil of the TV Station occured in between Deceased Mother's Memento (Manga: 586, 587-590, Anime: 492-494) and the Fake Patient (Manga: 595-598, 495-497).\n- The anime omitted a single chapter manga case called \"The Fugitive\" that took place in just before the Fake Patient (Manga: 595-598, 495-497). It has been made into an anime special called Fugitive: Kogoro Mouri. Moreover, opening 23 vaguely resembles the plot of this short case.\n- In episode 491, we can cleary see a restaurant that copied McDonald's since the logo was similar as the M of Mcdonald's but just put upside down making a W. The name of the restaurant was Welcome Burger.\n- Rikumichi Kusuda's vehicle is a grayish blue Nissan Fuga [Y50].\n- Akemi Miyano's vehicle is a white Nissan 240Z [S30].\n- Chianti's motorcycle is a black 2007 Ducati Superbike 1098, Korn's is a black 2006 Harley-Davidson Night Rod [VRSCD] and Vodka's is a blue 2008 Honda CB1300 Super Bol d'or.\n- Kir's vehicle is a sunlight silver 2006 Mazda Roadster (Mazda MX-5) with a retractable hardtop [NC].\n- Segawa's elder brother's vehicle was a Mercedes-Benz C-Klasse [W203].\n- Jodie's pistol in episode 497 is a SIG-Sauer P226 with suppressor.\n- The three FBI vans are indigo blue 2004 Toyota HiAce Super GL [H200].\n- The hospital patients at Haido Central Hospital's rooms include: 208 B Shinichi Takasaki (高崎 真一), 209 A Hiroki Hashimoto (橋本 弘樹), 209 B Yuji Saito (斉藤 雄二), 210 A Ryo Maeda (前田 亮), 210 B Kenichi Nashida (梨田 賢一), 211 A Sojiro Mito (水戸 宗次郎), 211 B Masamune Hatta (八田 正宗), 212 A Yumi Kanamori (金森 有美), 212 B Yoriko Sato (佐藤 頼子), 308 A Fujiyoshi Marukawa (丸川 藤吉), 309 A Haruka Suzuki (鈴木 春香), 309 B Ryoko Shimizu (清水 良子), 310 A Takuya Miyazaki (宮崎 卓也), 310 B Ken Kimishima (君島 剣), 311 A Hideki Yamagata (山形 秀樹), 311 B Kosuke Matsuzaka (松坂 康介), 312 A Yu Aida (相田 夕), 312 B Shiori Hashimoto (橋本 しおり), 313 A Rei Takeda (武田 零).
