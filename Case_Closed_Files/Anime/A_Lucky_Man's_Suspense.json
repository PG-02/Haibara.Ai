    "Situation": "Yokoto Owada, a doctor of the Beika Central Hospital, wins the third place prize at a raffle. The raffle makes it his third winning of the week: the first was a lottery, the second was a one year supply of beer. When Conan returns home, he discovers that the one year supply of beer that Owada supposedly won is a lie because the draw had been postponed and hadn't started yet. The next day, the Detective Boys find out the raffle had been fixed by a tall and slender woman posing as the doctor's wife. While investigating, they overhear gossip of the doctor's other made up winnings. What was the purpose of these strange rumors?\n",
    "People": "- 30 years old\n- Beika Central Hospital doctor\n- Yokoto's wife\n- Housewife\n- Raffle lottery staff\n- Beika Central Hospital nurse\n- 30 years old\n- Florist\n- Akiko's second son\n- Elementary school boy\n- Akiko's first daughter\n- Elementary school girl\n- Deceased (car hit)\n- Akiko's husband\n- Beika Central Hospital patient\n- Osawa Fruits and Vegetables shop owner\n- Beika Central Hospital patient\n- Beika Central Hospital patient\n- Housewife in Beika\n- Akiko's friend\n- Housewife in Beika\n- Akiko's friend\n- Housewife in Beika\n- Akiko's friend\n",
    "Resolution": "\nOne month earlier, her husband was killed in a hit and run accident. As Owada was the doctor who operated on him, Akiko held him responsible for her husband's death. After witnessing Owada win a lottery, she decided to kill him. She knew that if she went after him right away, she would be suspected immediately as the only one with a motive. So she spread the rumors to make people think that Owada was targeted by someone who was jealous of his supposedly good fortune.\n",
    "Quotes": "- Sleeping Kogoro (to the culprit ):\nNo matter what kind of steps you take to hide it, the committing of a crime will always be uncovered. But, I'm glad that I stopped you in time, because nothing has happened. So, you can still go back. Now, why don't you head home? Before those cute kids of yours wake up.  (どんなに工作を施そうと、犯罪の企ては必ずバレるんですよ。でも、間に合ったよかった。また何も起こってはいないんですから、何もまた起こってはいなです、だからまたあなたは引き返せるんです。さあ、急いで家にお帰りなさい、可愛いお子さんたちが目を覚ます前に。)\n"
