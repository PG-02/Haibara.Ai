    "People": "- Robber boss\n- Second robber\n- Victim (kidnapped)\n- 26 years old\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- Maki's husband\n",
    "Resolution": "\nShe had told them that there was a large pile of gold that they could steal and live off of. She then waited and deliberately let herself be captured and restrained in a closet, so that anyone who found her would believe that her husband was murdered by the burglars. However Conan is able to deduce that Amamiya is the murderer which she confirms stating that everything in this house is a toy including the gold the two burglars came to steal.\nShe then pulls out a knife and attempts to kill Conan and the kids, however Conan is able to take her down by bring down a large Gomera statue on top of her.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The Romain painting in Amamiya Residence is from Nichiuri TV in The Most Useful School in the World Case, and reappears in Takizawa Residence from The Beauty, The Lies, and The Secrets, in Setsuo Yamaga's apartment from Conan Kidnapped, and in an apartment from A Woman Standing by the Window.
