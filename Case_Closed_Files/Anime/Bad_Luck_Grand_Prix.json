    "Situation": "Kogoro takes Conan out to look for a Korean restaurant in the city and witnesses a hit and run resulting in two pedestrians being injured. A witness reveals he saw the car waiting for those two before speeding into their direction and Conan concludes it was an attempted murder.\n\nThe pedestrian Kiyotaka Okonogi is a wealthy man and his nephew, Kazuma Sakaki, is the prime suspect since Sakaki would be the one to inherit Okonogi's fortune. Sakaki's fiancée, Tomomi Ichikura, has an alibi since she sent a text to Sakiki about a bombing incident at a shopping mall which occurred during the time of the attack. The other pedestrian, Shinzaburo Tatematsu, reveals that the driver was the same culprit who stole his groceries and threatened to kill him. Disproving their theory Okonogi was the targeted victim.\n",
