    "Situation": "Conan's class finds an oxhide wallet containing a message from Ran, who left it ten years ago. Conan shares the story of how it got there. Ten years ago, Shinichi and Ran enter the school at night to investigate the rumors of a ghost. They run into a mysterious man who claims to be Shinichi's younger brother and who challenges them to a treasure hunt; He then leaves them the wallet with a note containing the message \"Quell the anger of Haido\" in Japanese and a hint that he likes red things. \"Quell the anger\" is a pun of \"drop the anchor\" so the riddle refers to Haido Port. With Agasa, the pair finds another riddle hidden on a red fire hydrant which says \"Clear the allegations against Toriya and demolish the liver of Goroukou\" in Japanese. Conan reveals that clearing the allegation is to prove innocent, which is \"white\" (白 ,shiro?) in police slang, which is a pun of castle (城 ,shiro?), so the hint means Toriya Castle. Goroukou is a reference to Mito Kōmon (水戸黄門 ?). Destroying the liver means destroying the middle, so removing the middle kanji of Mito Kōmon yields suimon (水門 ?, lit. flood gates). They find the next clue near a railroad crossing with red lights by the floodgates of Toriya Castle: \"Erase the evidence of Okuho. With a raspy voice, endure loneliness.\"\n\"Erase the evidence\" means a cancellation postal mark so they head to the Okuho post office but couldn't find anything. Shinichi then solves the rest of the riddle and heads to the school and finds the next riddle on a stop sign. The letter contains kanji, some of which are also mahjong jargon, and decodes to mean Beika City Hall. Once there, Shinichi finds the last riddle on a flag pole with the Japanese flag: \"S → W\". Shinichi presumes it means the sunset and assumes his father created the riddle for his entertainment, with the cooperation from the mysterious man. Shinichi and Ran waited for the mysterious man to show up but never met him again.\nBack in present time, Kobayashi and the Detective Boys remarked that the last clue was really disappointing and seemed redundant: it was just a simple \"S → W\" message, and to point to the sunset, it sufficed to use \"W\" alone. Conan suddenly realized his deduction years ago was wrong.\n",
