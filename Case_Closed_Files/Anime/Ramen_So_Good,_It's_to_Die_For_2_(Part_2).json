    "Situation": "\nThey learn that Shukichi Haneda had also been to the restaurant and left just before the three suspects arrived. Yumi confesses that she indeed ran into him that night, but didn't mention it because she didn't want him to get involved. Conan suggests that Yumi calls Shukichi, since he has very good memory, and ask if he had notice something about the culprit. At the same time, Masumi decides to call her smart brother too. Since he is also a regular at the Ramen restaurant, he might have seen the three suspects. Yumi reaches Shukichi, but before she can ask him, he puts her on hold to answer another call. Meanwhile, Masumi gets through to her brother, but he says that he is talking to an important person on the phone and asks Masumi to call him later, and then hangs up. Then, Yumi finally gets to talk to Shukichi. Shukichi says the person was making a weird sound with every step they took; \"Click... Click...,\" After hearing that, Conan and Masumi figure out what it actually means.\n",
