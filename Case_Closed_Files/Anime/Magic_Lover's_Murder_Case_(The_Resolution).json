    "Situation": "Sonoko invites Ran, to attend a meeting full of avid magic fans she met online. After dropping her off at the snowy lodge, Conan and Kogoro return home. During the ride, they hear on the radio that one of the members, Tsutomu Nishiyama, is found dead in his home and that his dying message was the name Dark Master, one of the members of the club.\n\nConan rushes back to the lodge only to find out the only bridge across is on fire. Fearing for Ran's life, Conan rushes through the bridge before it collapses and arrives at the lodge, though he inhales so much smoke that he passes out once he steps on its gate so Ran and Sonoko have to take care of him. Toshiya Hamano is later found dead ten metres from the lodge.\n\nConan wonders how the murder was done since no footprint was found in the snow.\nThe members of the lodge decide to leave the Hamano's body untouched to preserve the crime scene and retreat back into the lodge. They discuss among themselves and believe that the club member with the Username Dark Master is the murderer.\nConan, Ran, Kikue Tanaka, and Katsuki Doito head upstairs to retrieve a sweater. While upstairs, an arrow breaks through the window and almost hits them. At the same time, another arrow breaks through the window on the bottom floor. The people of the lodge head outside to investigate and find a crossbow on the ground. The people begin to believe that the culprit is an outsider of the club. Conan investigates and notices that there was evidence that something was stapled to the outside of the house. Conan realizes how the murders are done.\nConan recreates the crossbow attack on the top floor and lures everyone outside.\n",
    "People": "- 28 years old\n- Username: The Fake Child\n- Victim (strangled)\n- 27 years old\n- Username: The Disappearing Bunny\n- 25 years old\n- Username: Illusion\n- 46 years old\n- Username: The Silent Ventriloquist\n- Lodge owner\n- 23 years old\n- Part-time worker\n- 21 years old\n- Username: Red Herring\n- Victim (beaten)\n- 41 years old\n- Username: Escape King\n- Magic Lover's club leader\n- Magic Lover's club member\n- Possible culprit\n- Tokyo MPD police officer\n- Tokyo MPD police officer\n",
    "Resolution": "Once all of this is explained, Tanaka confesses to the murder and  being \"Dark Master\" and reveals that the group members online prompted her grandfather, Huden Harui, a famous magician, to attempt a dangerous trick which resulted in his death. While she accepted that the accident was her grandfather own fault, she couldn't forgive the comments from both Nishiyama and Hamano about his failure. Conan meanwhile confronts Katsuki Doito and reveals that his name is the anagram for Kaitou Kid. Kaitou Kid reveals that he saw that someone was on the magician's account and wanted to investigate it, and escapes the lounge with the use of his hang glider.\n- Deceased (accident)\n- Magician\n- Kikue's grandfather\n- Japan's \"Escape King\"\n",
    "Trivia": "- In this episode, Kaito says to Conan, \"Before the Bell announcing the century's end rings...\" just as he flew off in his hang glider, which may have something to do with this case being originally aired in January to February of the year 1999 and that his next appearance is in The Gathering of the Detectives! Kudo Shinichi vs. Kaitou Kid, which aired in 2001. The bell could have also been a reference to the next case Kid appears in, as it is about the Clock Tower heist.\n- When Sonoko says her favourite magician is Kaitou Kid, every other magic club member disagrees that he should deserve respect, as he is a thief, except for Doito, who aknowledges his fame, a hint towards his real identity.\n- The Nagano Prefecture snow mountains painting in Ara lodge is from Ski Lodge Murder Case. The beginning snow scene reappears in a painting in Yokosuka Castle from from The Last Wizard of the Century and in Tenbu Station from The Entrance to the Maze: The Anger of the Colossus.
