    "Situation": "Ayano Saeki and Mifuyu Morita work together in the bakery. Morita invites Saeki to hang-out in her apartment. While Saeki is standing at her door, she hears Morita screaming at her boyfriend Atsushi Tabata. When she enters with the spare key, Mifuyu is lying down on the floor having been stabbed in the chest apparently. There are footprints leading to the balcony. Mifuyu tells Saeki to run for her life saying that her boyfriend is still in the apartment.\n\nWhile running on the street to get help, Saeki bumps into Kogoro and Conan who apparently notice something strange with her and the blood on her shoulder. She explains that her friend has been stabbed. Saeki leads them to Mifuyu's apartment where they find the knife used for stabbing the victim lying on her floor but there is no body lying around. Conan notices the footsteps are dry which is strange because it hasn't been much time since the incident occurred. The police are called. Kogoro notices a suitcase missing and speculates that the culprit ran with her body in the suitcase. Later they go to the boyfriend's house. Saeki reveals that Atsushi was a fraud and had extracted 10 million yen from the victim. For this reason, Mifuyu was going to sue him.\nThey find blood outside Atsushi's house and drag marks of the suitcase inside which the body was carried. On entering the house, they find Atsushi poisoned on the table. Beside him is a letter that reads: \"I'm going to meet Mifuyu\".\n\nKogoro concludes that Atsushi felt guilty after killing Mifuyu so he committed suicide. They also find the suitcase used for carrying Mifuyu in another room. This is confirmed by a strand of hair inside it. Kogoro leaves the case to the Inspector as solved and they set out to search for the victim's dumped body.\n",
    "People": "- 25 years old\n- Mifuyu's friend and colleague\n- Bakery worker\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- 25 years old\n- Bakery worker\n- Victim (poison)\n- 35 years old\n- Mifuyu's boyfriend\n- Fraudster\n- Tokyo MPD Police officer\n- Tokyo MPD Police officer\n- College student\n- Kogoro's fan\n- College student\n- Kogoro's fan\n",
    "Resolution": "- The coffee mug Atsushi regularly used is in the cupboard. The cup used to administer the poison is one among those used for guests.\n- The culprit tried to hide her presence in Atsushi's house. The cup she used to drink her coffee was cleaned and kept in the cupboard. But the dishwasher scrub has a lipstick mark on the underside.\n- Tabata could have dumped the suitcase along with the body but he brought it to his home.\n- The footprints on Mifuyu's apartment were dry when Conan and Kogoro entered her apartment. This gives rise to a suspicion that they were deliberately produced beforehand.\n- The noise in the balcony of Mifuyu's apartment was created by using a pop-up toaster and keeping a tray above it. When the toast would pop out of the toaster, the tray would fall creating the noise. As evidence, there are breadcrumbs lying on the place where the toaster was placed.\nMifuyu Morita is confronted in the airport by Conan. She cut herself on the arm to paint the blood on her chest. As a result, there wasn't enough blood around the scene for a chest-stabbed victim. She had withdrawn 10 million yen from Atsushi's bank account and was planning to run away to Paris to live her dream of opening her own bakery. The suicide letter was a deliberate double-meaning sentence written by Atsushi himself as promise to Mifuyu that he'd come to Paris to see her. When she sees Saeki among the policemen, she tries to emotionally break her by blaming her revenge on her boyfriend to be assisted by the acts done by Saeki, telling her about how her boyfriend approached her with the same story and asked for 10 million yen as help. Megure and Takagi defend Saeki and tell Mifuyu that the revenge was entirely plotted and executed by her. Blaming the murder on Saeki is evading her responsibility for the sinful acts she has committed.\n"
