    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "A woman named Masami Hirota shows up at Kogoro's Detective Agency and asks him to find her father, Kenzo Hirota. She is reunited with her father when they located him in a horse racing track. The next day, Kenzo is found dead and Masami missing. Meanwhile, another detective is tracking Kenzo down for his client, Akira Hirota.\n\n\n",
    "People": "- Victim (hanged)\n- 48 years old\n- Former taxi driver\n- Kenzo's apartment landlady\n- Private detective\n- Victim (poison)\n- 28 years old\n- Pachinko parlor guard\n",
    "Resolution": "- Masami had make-up on and wore more formal, adult clothing when reunited with Kenzo, despite having presented herself as a highschool student from the countryside at first.\n- Every night, Kenzo would run the same taxi route over and over, even without customers, and at high speed. Also, he suddenly paid several months worth of rent to his landlady, who then told Kogoro that he did so in fresh and new cash.\n- Judging from the bruises from Kenzo's neck, the killer was a large man.\n- Masami's glasses were found in the crime scene.\n- Because of Conan's tracking button believed to be in Masami's watch, Akira was found dead due to cyanide poisoning (Sleeping pills) in the hotel.\nThe three Hirotas were the criminals involved in the 1 Billion Yen Robbery Case. The route Kenzo drove at night was the practice route of the getaway. But Kenzo betrayed his partners, running away and taking the money for himself. In order to find him, his partners made fake identities - Masami and Akira. When found, Akira killed Kenzo and made it look like suicide. He broke his watch while doing so that's why Masami gave him hers. But the real mastermind of the 1 Billion Yen Robbery Case was Okita. The poison that killed Akira may have originally been intended for Masami.\nOkita planned to kill the three from the very beginning. Kenzo realized this before the other two did, which is the true reason why he ran away with the money.\nWhile investigating near the hotel where Akira was found dead, Conan and the others run into a pretty lady in elegant red clothes who carries several suitcases. They don't pay lots of attention to her at first, but Conan soon realises that she is Masami Hirota, carrying the stolen money in said suitcases and probably about to meet the mastermind.\n\nMasami confronts Okita and angrily asks him why did he trick her into giving Akira the poisoned drink and kill him. Okita says Akira was too dumb to handle such a large quantity of money, and after drawing his gun he adds that he will also kill Masami to silence her and take all the money. Then Conan steps in and uses his Power Shoes to kick a can into Okita's face, capturing and knocking him out. Masami asks him who he is, and Conan calmly tells her \"I'm Conan Edogawa, and I'm a detective!\".\n\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga version of the story Gin and Vodka are the masterminds of the case rather than Okita, and they end up killing Masami Hirota/Akemi Miyano who informs Conan of the organization's existence and that they dress in black. Her death is the motive of Shiho Miyano's defection which leads to Ai Haibara's appearance later in the series. Furthermore, Shiho makes a silhouetted appearance when Akemi is demanding for herself and her sister to be free of the organization, which is also omitted. To repair the storyline, The Black Organization: One Billion Yen Robbery Case was written with a similar ending to the manga version.\nIn 2016, the anime special Episode One: The Great Detective Turned Small was released. It finishes with a rendition of Akemi's death that follows the manga rather than the anime.\n- In 2016, the anime special Episode One: The Great Detective Turned Small was released.

    "Trivia": "- This episode marks the introduction of a new image for the \"next episode\" preview. The image features the Detective Boys looking at a painting hanging on the wall, which has the title of the next episode written on it.\n- The spy's car is a gray Toyota Corolla AE100.\n- Kenzo Hirota drives a white Toyota Crown taxi.\n- At the end of the episode, Conan's transmitter was still on the watch that the dead guy was wearing, so Agasa probably had to make a new transmitter for future uses.\n- Although the Black Organization was involved in the manga version of this episode, the anime version has Okita take over Gin and Vodka's role, and therefore cutting out the Black Organization involvement for a second time, since this anime episode did not give away that she was affiliated with them in any way, although it did give her real name.\n",
    "Translation changes": "- The names of the characters in the Funimation Dub are:\n- Masami Hirota - Michelle Hamlin/Kendra Miyano\n- Kenzo Hirota - Kent Hamlin\n- Kenzo's cats: Kai, Tei, Gou & Ou - Kent's cats: Tea, Pair, Eyes & Prose\n- Akira Hirota - Aaron Hamlin\n- Okita - O'Brien\n"
