    "Situation": "While having a snack in a roadside café, Kogoro is called by Reiji Himuro, who seems envious of Kogoro's nice life and then says that at that moment, someone was to die because of Kogoro. At that time, Shingo Numao falls off a building, watched by a police officer who had been called there by an anonymous call.\n\nAfter Conan spots Himuro in a department store across the street, Kogoro runs there and up the stairs, where he is met by Himuro. Kogoro grabs Himuro at the lapels, which is photographed by customers. Both Himuro and Numao turn out to be bank robbers, with Numano having helped Kogoro apprehend Himuro who had been his boss.\nDuring the interrogation, Himuro provokes Kogoro into attacking him, knowing that Kogoro gave him an alibi for the time Numao fell. Kogoro accuses Himuro of killing Numao, but since there is no evidence at all and Kogoro himself gives an alibi to Himuro, Himuro is let go. Inspector Megure admonishes Kogoro that the way he behaved would have landed Kogoro in jail if it had gone on, and the media and the internet have a field day.\n",

    "Resolution": "He had tampered with the handrail so that it was weakened and would break, and lured Numao there. Calling him on the phone, he tricked him into thinking the police were after him and after seeing a cop walk up to him he ran up the fire escape and fell through the tampered railing. Part of the phone call was captured by an open radio recording revealing Himuro setting up Numao by giving him false information causing him to panic and fall to his death.\nFaced with all the evidence and being proven guilty, Himuro draws a knife and attacks Kogoro, but is intercepted by Ran.\n\n",
