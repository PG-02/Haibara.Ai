    "Situation": "Kogoro and Megure are tasked with a critical case that involves the kidnapping of a girl named Naoko Takei, who is being held hostage in a van near a warehouse by the harbor. When the group plus Ran, Conan and Naoko's father, Katsuhiko Takei, approach the van, however, the kidnapper panics and drives the van into the sea itself, killing both Naoko and themself. It turns out Naoko was a classmate of Shinichi and Ran, and as Megure asks Ran about her, Conan thinks of how she was an awkward and quiet \"lonely rich kid\".\nIn the following days, Conan befriends a young woman named Akiko Hanai, who works as both Takei's secretary and Naoko's former caretaker. As he gathers information, he realises that Takei had more than one enemy thanks to his corrupt business tactics, and that there's a slim chance that Naoko may be still alive. But he has to be very fast and careful if he wants to uncover the truth and save her.\n\n",

    "Resolution": "Akiko kidnapped Naoko after an outing and then faked her own death as well as the girl's, to prove Takei's affection for his child. Naoko was never held hostage in the van: Akiko played the role of both the kidnapper/driver and the victim, and drove the van into the sea to fake her and Naoko's deaths. When they were speaking, Conan noticed that at some point Akiko pinched her nose in a strange manner, to unclog her nose and ears after taking said \"dive\" and resurfacing too fast afterwards. He also saw that she was quite tanned save for her wrist, where she likely had a special wristwatch used by divers.\nLater, Akiko contacts Takei and, still hiding her identity, tells him that Naoko is still alive, and that he should come alone to the same warehouse and bring five million yen in cash if he wants to recover her. However, Takei uses a small amount of bills and cut newspaper as the ransom. This enrages Akiko, and she decides to kill him as punishment via dousing him in gasoline and then gets ready to burn him to death.\n\nAs she does so, she reveals her identity to Takei and reveals that the warehouse they are in once belonged to her family which had long since been abandoned. She also reveals that she knew about his crusade against her family and the damage it had caused. She also adds that she would've released Naoko without even taking the ransom, had Takei cared enough for his child to use real money. Conan, who greatly reminds Akiko of the deceased Masahito, appears and talks her out from her murder plans.\n",
