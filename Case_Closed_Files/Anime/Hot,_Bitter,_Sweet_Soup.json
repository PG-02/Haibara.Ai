    "Situation": "A woman, Fumie Ozawa, is found dead in her bathroom around 9 am, having appeared to have committed suicide by hanging herself with a thin wire, by her friend Etsuko Aikawa, who claims it was murder.\n\nThe medical examiner puts the time of death between 6 and 8 pm the previous night. Kogoro investigates the scene and sees that she schedules a dentist appointment for the same day of her \"suicide\". Conan finds a powdered substance, sneaks away with a sample, and when asking a store clerk of it, she says it is katakuri starch, a thickner with sugar properties. When looking in to Ozawa's company financials, the police find a 30 million yen deficit that they believed she embezzled and her superior/boyfriend, Ryota Shimizu, who was off the same day she died and received an e-mail from Ozawa at 5:45 pm yesterday, may have a connection. Aikawa claims she treated Fumie like a surrogate daughter all her life and would do nothing to harm her when the police question her as a suspect. Later, Aikawa's alibi is in question when a delivery man saw her earlier than she stated. She states that she found the body earlier than she did, but after she left money for Ozawa before finding her, and was going to notify the police afterwords.\n",
