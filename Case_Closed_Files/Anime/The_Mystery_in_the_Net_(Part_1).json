    "Situation": "Professor Agasa takes the Detective Boys and Conan to the beach during school break while Ran and Sonoko also happen to be on the same beach. At night, all of them eat dinner in a hotel together with the lifeguards they met that morning. The man the lifeguards are supposed to meet doesn't show up so they try calling him but the only sound that can be heard is the sound of the waves. The three lifeguards decide to look for the man at the beach and find him on the shore dead, covered in scratches and wrapped in a fisherman's net.\n\n",
    "People": "- 34 years old\n- Fisherman\n- 34 years old\n- Fisherman\n- Victim (drowned)\n- 51 years old\n- Fisherman\n- 35 years old\n- Fisherman\n- Deceased (drowned)\n- Nobutsugu's father\n- Fisherman\n- Deceased (drowned)\n- Noboru's father\n- Fisherman\n- Deceased (drowned)\n- Yuta's father\n- Fisherman\n- Beach guest\n- Beach guest\n",
    "Resolution": "After the three brought the necessary items, Conan, as Professor Agasa, reveals the trick the culprit, Noboru Shimojo used to kill the man. The victim, covered in fishnet, was placed in the shore where the culprit dug a hole fit for a man. He then placed a boat with sea water on top of the victim to serve as a weight so that when the victim wakes up he won't be able to escape when the tides rises up.\nThe killer placed false evidence on the boat so that the police would think that the victim was placed inside the boat before letting him drown. Shimojo also ends up revealing that he is the culprit, when he mentions the time of death to be around 8pm. However not even the police could get an accurate time of death because the tidal kept tossing and turning the corpse, combined with the cold sea water made it difficult to determine the time of death. Which is something only the culprit the themselves would know.\nShimojo confesses that he killed the man who was responsible for his, Yuta's, and Nobutsugu's father's death and that he only gathered all his courage to bestow divine punishment upon the man. He had tried to do things the right he even found a witness to the man's crimes, however he mysteriously disappeared. When Shimojo confronted him, he smugly said that a way to commit a perfect crime was to take yourself and your target on a boat and then push the target into the sea and drive away. Implying that man had killed the witness in order to stay out of jail.\n\n",
    "Difference between anime and manga": "- In the manga, Haibara was in the middle of watching a movie, 1997 Titanic, when she turned off the TV. In the anime, the movie scene was replaced by credit scene in French with the ocean in the background. Her outfit was also changed with her wearing a short pant instead of a dress.\n- When Haibara gave Conan the Voice-Changing Bow Tie, in the anime, the front part was facing her instead.\n",
