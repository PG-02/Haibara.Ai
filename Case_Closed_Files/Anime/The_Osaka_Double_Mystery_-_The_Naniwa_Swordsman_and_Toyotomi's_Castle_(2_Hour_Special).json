    "Case 1:": "",
    "Situation": "\n\n\n",
    "People": "- 64 years old\n- Tour guide\n- Role of Tokugawa Ieyasu\n- 32 years old\n- Tour guide\n- Role of Akechi Mitsuhide\n- Victim (bashed)\n- 39 years old\n- Tour guide\n- Role of Nene\n- 35 years old\n- Tour guide\n- Role of Oda Nobunaga\n- Victim (burned)\n- 36 years old\n- Tour guide\n- Role of Toyotomi Hideyoshi\n- Deceased (burned)\n- Founder of the tour guide service\n",
    "Resolution": "After investigating thoroughly, Heiji and Conan conclude the murderer to be Shigehiko Wakisaka, one of the tour guides at the castle who committed the murders through the use of self-destructing flashlights. Wakisaka confesses and reveals that he was murdering his fellow tour guides who murdered his grandfather thirteen years ago in search of a legendary treasure in the Osaka Castle.\n\nArihiro Kasuya, who was also involved in a series of armed robberies to locate this treasure, confesses to having colluded with the other victims and prepares to kill Heiji but is apprehended by the police.\n\n\nWakisaka then melancholically reveals to Kasuya that he discovered too late that his grandfather already knew that the rumors of the treasure were fake, since it was already stolen by the legendary thief Kajisuke. His grandfather never exposed the secret because he could not bear to break the hearts of his colleagues who were enjoying themselves so much, expecially Kasuya. Arihiro is dumbstruck that he wasted all his years searching for treasure and killed for nothing.\n",
    "Case 2:": "",
    "Continuity": "- In this case, Heiji showed Kazuha the scar that she gave him on Bikuni Island, which is referring to And Then There Were No Mermaids case, when she stabbed his hand to try and make him let go of her so that he will not die too, when he was hanging onto a tree branch over a cliff.\n- When Kazuha asked Heiji if he still has his lucky charm, it is referring to the amulet that he placed around Conan's neck in The Naniwa Serial Murder Case which saved his life, when Conan was almost stabbed, and at that time, Hattori has been having nightmares where Kudo got killed, so he gave him the amulet to protect him.\n- In The Night Before the Wedding Locked Room Case, the amulet had been stated to be back in Heiji's possession again.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is the third episode to use digital animation, after The Cornered Famous Detective! Two Big Murder Cases and The Gathering of the Detectives! Shinichi Kudo vs. Kaitou Kid. Traditional animation will still be used in every episode until Chinatown Deja Vu in the Rain.\n- This is the only episode where Shinji Ogawa voiced Ginshiro Toyama. He then voiced Ginshiro in three movies, before passed away on March 7, 2015.\n- Although Soshi Okita is from Yaiba manga, its animated series, Kenyuu Densetsu Yaiba, ended on April 1, 1994 with \"Kaguya Arc,\" so this case is his first animated appearance ever.\n- The suspects' names from the first case are from the names of different parts of equipment and clothing in kendo: Atsushi Tarumi (垂見 篤史) the piece of cloth that wraps around the waist (tare, 垂れ), Mineo Omotani (面谷峰男) the mask or helmet (men, 面), Noriyuki Doguchi (胴口 規之) the breastplate (do, 胴), Takashi Kotegawa (小手川 峻) the gloves (kote, 小手), and Masamichi Hakamada (袴田 正通) the garment for the lower body (hakama, 袴).\n- The suspects' names from the second case are from the Seven Spears of Shizugatake, seven bodyguards who protected Toyotomi Hideyoshi during the battle of Shizugatake: Toshiaki Fukushima/Fukushima Masanori, Hirano/Hirano Nagayasu, Arihiro Kasuya/Kasuya Takenori, Maho Katagiri/Katagiri Katsumoto, Yuji Kato/Katō Kiyomasa and Katō Yoshiaki, and Shigehiko Wakisaka/Wakisaka Yasuharu.\n"
