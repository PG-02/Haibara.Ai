    "Situation": "A free-lance writer comes to do a story about the Detective Boys. They go along with their teacher to the writer's apartment, but when they arrive they find that he has been bludgeoned to death.\n\nConan immediately notices that there is blood wiped from one of the buttons on the answering machine as well as blood on the doorknob. He suggests that the culprit may have left a message to establish an alibi. Haibara warns Conan not to show off because he'll attract attention, so he tries to guide Takagi and Megure to the clues in his usual childish manner. The Detective Boys on the other hand feel like Conan's childish antics are making them look immature.\nThree out of the four messages on the answering machine are suspect, but in each one there is something going on which helps them verify the time and place of the call. In the first Haruka leaves the victim a message with the T.V. playing in the background. In the second they hear the train conductor who has allergy troubles. In the third the caller asks someone for the date and time during the call. Conan with the help of the other Detective Boys drops hints for the police until they realize that only one of the alibis could have been faked.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (bludgeoned)\n- 32 years old\n- Free writer\n- 29 years old\n- General worker\n- 33 years old\n- Gas station worker\n- 32 years old\n- Koeikan Publishing House editor\n- Inaba's superior\n- Editor\n",
    "Resolution": "",
    "Trivia": "- Kobayashi mentions the Detective Boys mostly look for lost cats. The Detective Boys are shown looking for cats named Minami, Megumi and Ai. Genta says the names seem familiar. They correspond to the voice actors of Conan, Ai and Mitsuhiko.\n- Atsushi Inaba's motorcycle is a 1990 Yamaha XJR 400.\n- The gas station where Higaki works is named \"Yotsubishi\", a pun to the famous Mitsubishi Motors company. Yotsubishi means \"four diamonds\" and Mitsubishi means \"three diamonds\". The logo is also slightly modified from Mitsubishi's logo.\n- This is the final case of Ai Orikasa's performance as Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya's voice actor, since Ikue Otani will resume her role in The Car Stunt's Utmost Limit.\n- This is the first case that it is revealed that Sumiko Kobayashi is a dead ringer for Detective Miwako Sato, when she is not wearing her glasses.\n- Sumiko Kobayashi is a huge fan of Edogawa Ranpo books.\n- Although Sumiko Kobayashi appeared startled and shocked with the way that Conan was reasoning and deducing early on in this case, she should not have been too shocked since she saw how Conan was acting in the SOS! Messages from Ayumi case, which is the first time that Conan ran out of her class due to the urgency of a case and he quickly instructed her to call the police.\n",
