    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Jodie is planning to leave, and Ran and Sonoko, stunned by the news, decide to throw her a going away party. They go into the store and find young woman named Aya being accused of shoplifting by her boss. They manage to come up with three possible suspects. Ran attempts to call Shinichi or Conan for help, since both are better at solving mysteries, but surprisingly, Jodie stops her and tells her to use her own deduction.\n\nAya's boss threatens to fire her and call the police if the case isn't solved, leaving Ran as her only hope. Ran speaks to Shinichi before sharing her deduction.\n",
    "People": "- 17 years old\n- Ran and Sonoko's middle school classmate\n- Sunday Mart manager\n- Sunday Mart employee\n- Game maniac\n- Office worker\n- Old lady\n- Customer using the toilet\n- TMS Delivery company employee\n- Store merchandise deliveryman\n- TMS Delivery company employee\n- Store merchandise deliveryman\n",
    "Resolution": "",
    "Evidence": "- The reason why none of the security cameras wasn’t able to capture an intruder was because the thief was residing within the store's restroom air ventilation system, and the thefts were conducted after the store had closed.\n- Although Aya only works 2-3 shifts per week, the man was able to sustain himself by stealing a sizable amount of foods to survive for 2-3 days. Additionally, the reason that he chose the day of Aya's shift to steal was because the supply boxes that always blocked the passage between the toilet and the main store on the days that Aya didn't work: if he moved the boxes by himself, the other employees might have suspect that someone was hiding in the store.\n- The man himself only bought towel and toiletries to go take a bath outside. If he didn't take care of his hygiene, then he would never be able to leave his hideout or the shop.\n- The expired foods were taken for daily meals, while the Game CDs would be sold outside the shop for money to be used at the barber and bathhouse.\n- In order for no one to notice him hiding in the shop, the man was always last in line to enter the bathroom and waited until the store was full of customers to leave.\n- Lastly, the reason that the theft had stopped for quite a while was because the man realized that he had been causing trouble for Aya and almost got her fired after hearing her being reprimanded by the owner, but eventually had to resume the theft due to the fact that the stolen foods had run out. Additionally, the reason that only expired foods were taken was to reduce the damage to the store as low as possible. Nevertheless, Ran proclaims that she cannot forgive him for that as a thief is a thief no matter the reason.\n",

    "Manga to anime changes": "- The anime failed to draw the irregular borders of Jodie's pictures correctly for a second time after the first omission in English Teacher vs. Great Western Detective. This time, Araide's face was hidden completely under other pictures, making this clue, once again, useless.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is the second case to meet a former classmate or schoolmate of Shinichi, Ran, and Sonoko. The first one was Asami Uchida, from middle school, who is now in college in The Memories of First Love Case, however in this case it is Aya Nanakawa, who is also from middle school.\n- Professor Agasa drinks from a white coffee cup with an H on it.\n- This is the second case that Ran solved the crime. The Invisible Weapon, Ran's First Investigation was the first.\n",
