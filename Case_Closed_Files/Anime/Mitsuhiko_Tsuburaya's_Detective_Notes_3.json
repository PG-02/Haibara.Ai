    "Situation": "Mitsuhiko, Ayumi, and Genta happen to witness a quarrel taking place in front of an elderly actor selection venue, where two retired brothers, named Makio Yuida and Kozo Yuida respectively, were involved. To ascertain further details, the three Detective Boys visit Kozo and learn that Kozo was chosen to be the elderly actor immediately, which aroused Mitsuhiko to share some Sherlock Holmes \"canon\". He tells Kozo about the short story titled The Red-Headed League. Accordingly, he suspects Kozo might be drawn into a gigantic fraud, which is similar to the Sherlock Holmes story. However, as they arrived at Kozo's home, nothing out of the ordinary was noticed. Kozo mentioned that he and his brother each had a teapot inherited from their father. Recently he received a letter expressing his desire to purchase both their teapots. Soon, Mitsuhiko noticed something odd in the letter: even though the return address was written to be in Kyoto, the post stamp was clearly from Tokyo.\nAt the same time, Conan and Haibara were searching for the rest of the people, but encountered Detective Nakamura following Makio. When the Detective Boys liaised with each other, they inquired Makio about the teapot, yet were blasted away by him promptly. While leaving Makio's home, the Detective Boys met Ami Kimura, who was Makio's neighbour. She disclosed that Makio often talked about his journeys at the veranda, despite their unfamiliarity. Ayumi then noticed the cocoon on Kimura's hand, and the gloves in her pocket; as such, she surmised that Kimura is a mangaka.\nSuccessfully, a serial robbery case happening persistently in second-hand stores caught their attention - importantly, the head of the robbery gang was still yet to be captured. Conan then notices Detective Takagi and Detective Chiba, who are again on a stakeout. According to their observations, Makio is most likely the head of robbers. Mitsuhiko continued this deduction and speculated that his proceeding target is Kozo. The Detective Boys hurry to Kozo's house, but Kozo declares that he has just received another letter, and it also comes with a ticket to Kyoto.\nThat night, Mitsuhiko discoveres Kozo was sneakily following Makio. They all saw Makio had opened the door of his apartment, but he then hesitated, and returned to his house immediately. Kozo was then instigated to contact his brother Makio. On the phone Makio discloses that \"he needed money since he now depends 'on credit' to make a living (ツケで暮らしていて), and would approach Kozo in turn\". Mitsuhiko notices something strange. Normally Makio calls Kozo by his name, but in the phone call, the appellation was changed to \"younger brother\" (弟); as such, Makio was trying to explain his relationship with Kozo. In addition to that, \"Tsuke\" (ツケ) is a terminology in the game of go, meaning adjacent to the enemy. This suggests that Makio is in danger, so Detective Chiba goes to rescue him by heading upstairs.\n\nDespite this, Makio was found beaten by the teapot in his home. He's left in a non-life-threatening condition. Meanwhile, Mitsuhiko runs towards the corridor of the buckwheat noodle restaurant and confronts the culprit.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (robbed)\n- 78 years old\n- Retiree\n- 75 years old\n- Retiree\n- Makio's younger brother\n- 34 years old\n- Makio's neighbour\n- Mangaka\n- Lives in Higashiyama, Kyoto\n- Potential buyer for Makio and Kozo's pots\n- Thieves Gang member\n",
    "Resolution": "",
    "Culprit's Escape Route": "Kimura is the head of the robber gang, she intended to take Makio's home as her next target of robbing. Owing to the fact that she lives just right beside Makio's home, she formulated a path for escape to be used after she robs Makio. By entering Makio's home, she would only need to force-break the wall between the two rooms; when escaping, she destined to third floor by using the escape staircase located on the veranda, then by taking advantage of the empty room below Makio's home getting to second floor. Hence, she could arrive at the buckwheat noodle restaurant, she knew beforehand that the restaurant had not been operating during nighttime for many evenings; with the noisy construction sound established at the background, she could escape effortlessly.\n",
    "All About Robbery": "Being the head of robber gang, Kimura could not be a mangaka; conversely, the reason that she had gloves contained in her pockets was because that she did not want her fingerprints to be left elsewhere - if it was a real mangaka, the gloves would be stained slightly. Moreover, her necklace was a magnifying glass instead, to identify precious jewels; the cocoon on her finger was obviously caused due to her long-term use of the magnifying glass.\nAfter hearing Mitsuhiko's deduction, Kimura was incensed and intended to grab Mitsuhiko as a hostage, but failed under the football ejected by Conan who arrived to draw a finale of this serial second-hand stores robbery case.\n",
    "Aftermath": "Prior to that, Conan had already confirmed the identity of the sender of that mysterious letter, it was in fact Makio Yuida.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The The Red-Headed League is a Sherlock Holmes short story which was referenced in this episode.\n- The landmarks Makio and Kozo visit in Kyoto are Kiyomizu-dera and Heian-jingū.\n",
    "Quotes": "- Conan Edogawa praising Mitsuhiko:\nNot by chance, but because of careful observation. Truly a member of the Detective Boys.  (たまたまじゃないさ、よく見ていたからだ。さすが探偵団だぜ。)\n"
