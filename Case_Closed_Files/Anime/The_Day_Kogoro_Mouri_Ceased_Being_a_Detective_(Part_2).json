    "Situation": "Kogoro receives a request from a client named Ryozo Gamo to find a witness to confirm his alibi.\n\nOn the sixth day Gamo calls Kogoro and tells him he has lost hope in him. The next day, Gamo is found hanged in a forest an hour in distance away.\n\nThe police suspect it to be suicide but Kogoro reveals it is a murder, as Gamo could have killed himself at home if he wanted to. After interrogating Gamo's nephew, Kyosuke Arai, Kogoro returns home to find news reporters who question Kogoro about the suicide revealed to be murder. The next day, Kogoro heads to the horse track and meets up with his old friend, Isao Takeoka, the detective who falsely accused Gamo of a crime five years ago. They work together and investigate Ryozo's ties and end up at his nephew's house. They interrogate Arai and reveal his motive for the murder would be the inheritance. The next day, Arai is found in his house hanged and Kogoro decides to close his detective agency by removing its sign.\n\nThe police continue their search for the suspect of the murder. After much convincing by Ran, Eri comes to comfort her depressed husband, much to the chagrin of the earlier client, Sayuri Tokomae. This display of affection from Eri towards her husband leads to Tokomae charging into the office and knocking the lawyer away. Claiming that Kogoro promised to take up her case, the love-smitten Tokomae drags Kogoro out of the building and off to the park where he is forced to go jogging with her. As Kogoro realizes that she is yet another person who benefited from Gamo's death, a trio of masked robbers attempt to mug Tokomae.\n\nHe defeats robbers after her jewelry and is escorted to the hospital. Once there, Kogoro overhears a patient discuss Gamo and his medical test which took place on the day Kogoro met with him. Kogoro investigates and heads to Gamo's company to retrieve a recording of the victim's voice. However the culprit steals the recording from Kogoro and escapes. Conan tells Kogoro that Gamo filed a complain to a company and that the company has a recording of the phone call.\n",
