    "Situation": "A man running away from a police officer stumbles into the Detective Boys, grabs Ayumi as a hostage. But he suddenly collapses, with a big wound at the back of his head.\n\nHe has no identifying papers on him, and in Beika Hospital, his situation is pronounced critical. Conan and the Detective Boys track the man back, realizing he had been injured for quite a while, and finally find themselves at the backside of Beika Hospital.\n",
    "People": "- Unidentified man\n- 40 years old\n- Beika Hospital emergency medical doctor\n- 25 years old\n- Beika Hospital nurse\n- Tokyo MPD policeman\n- Train driver\n- Convenience store owner\n- Arcade customer\n- Taxi company driver and owner\n",
    "Resolution": "The proof is the smell of the paint stuck to the culprit and the victim. The two of them fought near a freshly painted bench, and the wet paint stuck to them. As the fleeing culprit tried to shake off the victim from his car, the victim's button tore off. The man was thrown to the ground and hit his head on the bench. Then, the man descended the stairs to the vacant lot below to get a taxi to chase after him. As further evidence, the victim's fingerprints match to the fingerprints found on the culprit's car window.\nKogoro, via Conan, revealed that the motive is the magazine clipping, on the back of which was an ad for a medical book that Dr. Kido wrote. One month ago, the man was on a train when his daughter fell ill, and had asked if there were any doctors available to help his daughter. At the time, Dr. Kido pretended not to be a doctor, or rather was stopped by the woman who was with him. He had a wife and child, and he didn't want to draw attention to his relationship with the woman travelling with him.\nHowever, the man later found out that Dr. Kido lied, and went to confront him with a knife. His daughter had died from a chronic illness that took a turn for the worse. It didn't matter if the doctor could have saved her back then; the only thing the man couldn't forgive him was the doctor for lying. Dr. Kido agreed, truly remorseful about what happened, and was sincere about wanting to save the man's life.\nBut, the doctor had a jacket with paint on it from the earlier fight. It was missing from the trunk of his car. Conan realizes that the man was in danger, and runs off to save him.\n\nNatsumi Morita was the woman who was travelling with the doctor on the train. She had earlier offered to dispose of the paint covered jacket, but Dr. Kido refused. She was afraid that the doctor would turn himself in if he had successfully saved the man. She feared that everyone would find out that she was Dr. Kido's mistress.\n",
