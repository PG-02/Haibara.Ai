    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan take a trip to Kushiro marshland, Hokkaido Prefecture, to see the red-crowned cranes. They run into an old man who takes care of the cranes and he invites them to his house. His daughter and son rush into the room demanding the reason why he is donating his life savings to the city. The group is allowed to soak in the hot spring near the house, but they are called when they find out the old man has been murdered.\n\n",
    "People": "- Victim (arrow shot)\n- Crane lover\n- Former Tokyo automobile company president\n- 53 years old\n- Artist\n- Shuzo's younger brother\n- 27 years old\n- Company employee\n- Shuzo's eldest son\n- 29 years old\n- Boutique employee\n- Shuzo's eldest daughter\n- 58 years old\n- Lawyer\n- Detective from Hokkaido Police, North Sea Station\n- Deceased (illness)\n- Shuzo's wife\n- Noriko and Hiroshi's mother\n- Tamotsu's sister-in-law\n",
    "Resolution": "However, Conan as Kogoro disproved this and revealed the real culprit who is Tamotsu Machida. He had setup a bowgun in the chimney of the fireplace and had used a piece of wood that was placed behind the trigger which was all restrained together with a rubberband. The piece of wood and the bowgun were connected with fishing wire, he then waited for Hiroshi to fire his bowgun at the same time pulling the wire connected to the piece of wood causing to trigger to be pulled back due to the rubberband which fired a crossbow killing the victim. He then pulled the bowgun out of the chimney using the fishing wire.\nThus Tamotsu successfully framed Hiroshi for the murder. However he had left evidence of his crime behind, the glass that was going to be used to replace the broken window had a scratch on it that most likely came from the crossbow Hiroshi fired. The glass from the window was neatly lined up meaning something was blocking the glass from scattering on the floor it's Super elastic mirror. Finally inside the chimney there was a void in the shape of a straight line most likely from the fishing wire. Another piece of evidence was a single bird feather in his back pocket which came from the nest on top of the chimney proving he was was there and committed the murder.\nHis motive was that he was mooching off Shuzo for money and after learning that he was going to donate his entire fortune for the endangered birds he decided to kill him and frame Hiroshi to inherit his wealth.\n",
