    "Situation": "Kogoro received a letter from someone called Taisei Nichihara, asking him to investigate the suicide of his old friend, along with a piece of paper containing a cipher that is claimed to have been found at the feet of the body. Kogoro, along with Conan, Amuro, and Wakita then arrived at an abandoned church deep in the mountains of Nagano. They later meet five other guests who are high school classmates of Taisei Nichihara, and revealed that Nichihara is the one who committed suicide.\n\nSuddenly, the nearby parking lot collapses, and all cars parked there fall into the ravine. Amuro notices that the parking lot sign is brand new, despite the church being very old. Wakita senses that there will be serial murders happening.\nUnfortunately, the Nagano police can't come to the church, because the tunnel that leads to the church was blocked by a snow avalanche. Komei then smells gunpowder around the avalanche, implying that the avalanche was caused by a human. The nine people are forced to spend a night in the church.\nLater, they find a paper, instructing them to search for the code sheets in each room in the church. One of the guests, Sumiya Nishino, suggests drawing lots to decide who is searching in each room by using 9 pieces of paper and a tissue box. They later find the code sheets and return to the chapel, except Kouhei Wada. After an hour passes, everyone present decide to go to the toilet where Wada is searching. Unfortunately, Wada is found dead by an arrow from an automatic crossbow trap.\n\nKogoro then informs the Nagano police about the murder. He later sends a video of the crime scene. While watching the video, Komei notices Amuro, and feels that he has met Amuro somewhere before.\nMeanwhile, Amuro suggests that they form pairs. Fujide with Koura, Nishino with Kawasaki, Conan with Amuro, and Kogoro with Wakita. Conan and Amuro then decide to go investigate the toilet first. They talk about who might be the culprit. Suddenly, Conan asks Amuro if he knows RUM. Amuro replies that no matter whether he answers that he has met RUM or not, Conan will start investigating everyone around him, so he can only tell Conan that RUM is impatient.\nMeanwhile in the chapel, the others hear some odd noise. Nishino then decides to draw by lot again which pair should check the noise, this time using mint cases. In the end, Nishino and Kawasaki are the ones who check the noise.\nAfter Amuro and Conan return, Nishino suddenly enters the chapel hurriedly, asking who is sending messages to Kawasaki and making him head to the bath. Later, they hear Kawasaki's scream, and when they arrive, Kawasaki is dead.\n\nAmuro deduces that Kawasaki got poisoned by cyanide, but Wakita finds out that there is no cyanide in the water Kawasaki consumed. They also find another code sheet on the floor. Unfortunately, Kogoro can't contact the Nagano police because there is no service.\nAmuro then investigates the message Kawasaki received, and Kogoro compares the sender address with the other three people, only to find out that all addresses are different. Conan then suggests that they should solve the code sheets. Amuro and Conan realize that there is honey on Kawasaki's phone. Wakita then remarks that Amuro and Conan are close to each other, and Conan seems pretty smart. Amuro then answers that Conan is copying Kogoro's detective work.\nMeanwhile, Komei recalls that he met Amuro years ago after being introduced by his younger brother Hiromitsu. He also deduces that the one who send Hiromitsu's phone is Amuro. Suddenly, Kansuke receives a call from Kuroda, demanding to have a talk with Komei.\nNishino decides to lock himself in the study room until the police arrive. Meanwhile, Amuro thinks that since the culprit invited nine people, there must be something related to the number 'nine'. All four detectives then find out who the culprit is.\n",
    "People": "- 27 years old\n- High school teacher\n- Shinano University graduate\n- Victim (arrow shot)\n- 28 years old\n- Company employee\n- Shinano University graduate\n- 27 years old\n- Office worker\n- Raito's ex-girlfriend\n- Victim (poison)\n- 28 years old\n- Bank employee\n- Shinano University graduate\n- 28 years old\n- Bartender\n- Deceased (hanged?)\n- Shinano University student\n",
    "Resolution": "Suddenly, Nishino starts screaming and tries to consume a pill containing poison, only to be stopped be Kogoro.\n\nThe culprit is Sumiya Nishino. He planned to commit suicide and frame Raito Fujide for his death as well as the others. He made Wada go to the toilet by making Wada to write his name on the paper which have four torn edges. Nishino also made him and Kawasaki the ones to investigate the noise by hiding a full mint case inside his sleeve while shaking the empty one. Kogoro deduces that the noise is made by Nishino himself using another phone. He also poured honey on Kawasaki's phone and made him touch the screen by sending a message. Since Kawasaki is a clean freak, he will head to the toilet to wash his hands. Nishino also applied poison to Kawasaki's handkerchief. Conan noticed that Kawasaki bites his handkerchief while washing his hand, so the poison can easily get onto his lips, and the poison was swallowed while he was drinking. Kogoro also deduces that Nishino is a magician and that he could easily swipe a phone or handkerchief, and leave a blank code sheet in Fujide's bag.\nAmuro deduces that the key of deciphering the code is baseball. Nine letters can be read from the code in the order of the player numbers in baseball.\n- The code Kogoro received reads \"It's time to play ball.\"\n- The code stuck to the chapel door reads \"One out in the toilet.\"\n- The code found in the rooms reads \"Two outs in the bath.\"\n- The code found next to Kawasaki's body reads \"Three outs in the study.\"\n- The code handed to Fujide reads \"Perfect game.\"\nNishino found out that his highschool baseball team lost a game against another highschool attached to Shinano University on purpose while he is injured. After that, the team's ace, Taisei Nichihara, lost his reputation, and unsuccesfully join independent leagues. As the result, he committed suicide. Nishino was frustated because he was not there to stop the team losing on purpose. Nishino deduced that the reason the team losing on purpose is to got into Shinano University easily.\nHowever, Fujide then reveals that the reason is for Nichihara's future. Because Nichihara played 42 innings and threw roughly 1000 pitches in a short amount of time, his shoulder was at its limit. Wada suggested to lose on purpose because Nichihara insisted on pitching until the end otherwise. However, it was too late. After that, Nichihara dumped Koura, realizing that he could not make her happy with his body.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- Ikue's hair is black in the manga, when in the anime is changed to blonde, while Raito's originally blonde hair is changed to dark brown. Kouhei's black hair is also changed to dark brown.\n- Kouhei Wada's eyes are open when his body is found in the manga, but the anime version of the scene has his eyes closed.\n- The scene where Kawasaki dies is longer in the anime, as we see the process of him slowly dying from the effects of the poison, whereas the manga only shows his corpse.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Ikue's brand of mint chips Prisk is named after the Belgian mint manufacturer Frisk.\n- The names of the suspects come from closed-down Japanese baseball stadiums:\n- Raito Fujide (藤出 頼人) comes from Fujiidera Stadium (近鉄藤井寺球場, Kintetsu Fujiidera kyūjō)\n- Kouhei Wada (和田 孝平) comes from Heiwadai Stadium (平和台野球場, Heiwadai Yakyūjō)\n- Yosuke Kawasaki (川崎 陽介) comes from Kawasaki Stadium (川崎球場, Kawasaki Kyūjō)\n- Sumiya Nishino (西野 澄也) comes from Hankyu Nishinomiya Stadium (阪急西宮スタジアム, Hankyū Nishinomiya Sutajiamu)\n- Ikue Koura (古浦 郁絵) comes from Korakuen Stadium (後楽園球場, Kōrakuen Kyūjō)\n- Taisei Nichihara (日原 泰生) comes from Nippon Life Stadium (日本生命球場, Nihonseimei kyūjō)\n"
