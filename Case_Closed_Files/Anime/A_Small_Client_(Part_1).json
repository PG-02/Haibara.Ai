    "Situation": "A seven year old movie star by the name of Kazuki Kinukawa comes to the Mouri Detective Agency to try and find his mother who abandoned him at a church. His reasons are to tell his mother he will not give her any money now that he is famous. Conan is able to deduce Kazuki's mother is a hotel employee in Atami due to the old dirty postcards she sent him. Kazuki reveals that he remembered that his mother had a beauty mark near her breast. The trio and Kazuki travels to Atami to track down the hotel. They manage to find the hotel that sells the postcards and an employee there comfirms that the leftovers get divided between them. However they don't have one named Atsuko working here, but Kazuki's mother might have use another name. A freelance writer named Yasuhiro Kamoshita checks into the hotel as he plans to find Kazuki's mother and interview her to confirm whether Kazuki's father was truly a murderer. Later that day, Kamoshita is strangled to death but managed to take a picture on his cellphone during the attack.\n\nThe investigation reveals that the victim had been approaching the employees one by one and saying 'If you remember the 20 million yens, come to my room. Or else I will reveal everything.'\nThe picture reveals that a woman with a beauty mark near her breast is the murderer. The police gather three female employees with no alibi during the time of the murder; Each of them has a beauty mark but none of them are near the breast. But as they take a closer look at the phone they discover that Kamoshita made a phone call shortly before the murder, around 11:48 PM. They call the number and get a hold of a chief editor Izumiya from 'Weekly Hot'. He explains that Kamoshita had been on the trail of a hot scoop and that the person he was going to interview was taking a shower before the interview.\n\nThe woman with the hot scoop was Atsuko, Kazuki's mother. Kamoshita had gotten wind of that she had contacted Kazuki's production company and blackmailed them for ¥20 million if they didn't want it public that his father was a wanted murderer who is still on the lose. The company paid the money after the woman proved her identity by showing knowledge of Kazuki's birthmark and the name of the church where he was brought up. But no one known the woman's face or her voice, since the communication had been through e-mails. Kamoshita decided to track the woman down and get the whole story from her. He was planning on taking a picture of her with his phone.\nConan realized that the reason that the victim kept mentioning 20 million yen to the inn's employers was to scare one of them and find the blackmailer.\nThe forensic team reveals that Kamoshita was knocked on the head with a shower nozzle knocking him unconscious and was later strangled. While the police are watching a videotape found in Kamoshita's room, Conan notices that the movie ended one minute earlier than the time indicated on the box and realizes how the murder is done.\n",

    "Resolution": "Toshiko had also lied about being Kazuki's mother, but this is because she cannot have children and has a deep envy of one of her fellow hosts who had a child but gave him away, the real mother of Kazuki, who also had told the details of him which Toshiko used in the blackmail. Said woman turns out to be Tomoka Saegusa. Conan later confirms to Ran that Tomoka is the mother because she used to carry Kazuki on her back with a sling while doing household chores, until she gave him up; this is why Kazuki, who had very good memory for a little kid yet couldn't recall all details, mistakenly recalled his mom's mole to be on her breast instead of on the back of her neck, where it actually is. He suggest at Kazuki might have mixed his memories from his time at the church.\n",
