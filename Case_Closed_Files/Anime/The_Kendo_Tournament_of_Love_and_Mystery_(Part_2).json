    "Characters introduced": "- Tokyo representative\n- Semi-finalist\n- Kendo player\n",
    "Cast": "",
    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Conan, Ran, and Kazuha came to Toto Stadium, Tokyo, to watch Heiji's important kendo competition. As Heiji wins a fight with verve, his rival follows him closely behind: Soshi Okita, Shinichi's lookalike he met during a previous case. Heiji says to himself he can't but get even with Okita today, he has to win, for Kazuha. Meanwhile, Momiji and Iori are on the phone, Iori informing Momiji of Heiji's high rankings in the competition, while Momiji asks him if everything is ready for the \"little party\" after Heiji's victory. Iori adds Heiji may confront Okita and another kendo practitioner, \"as strong as a demon\".\n\nConan suggests they call the police and keep an eye on the bathroom, as the murderer may still be armed and has an accomplice. Conan is joined by a high school kendo practitioner he thought was Heiji but actually is Okita, who says Nukitani's absence of struggling reminds him of tsujigiris (wanton murders of random passers-by by samurais in the past, when they wanted to try out a new sabre's efficiency). He adds the sabre's blow was deadly, perfect and neat, the work of an expert. Okita introduces himself to Conan, saying he's from Kyoto Senshin kendo club - just like the murderer, something Conan is ignorant of.\n\nHeiji were able to solve the crime because of the hint about changing clothes and is now presenting his deduction to everyone.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (throat slit)\n- 43 years old\n- Kendo referee\n- 78 years old\n- Blind since 3 years ago\n- Former kendo player\n- 40 years old\n- Kendo referee\n- Shido's co-worker\n- 28 years old\n- Part-time worker\n- 31 years old\n- Former Self-Defense Force member\n- Shido's ex-girlfriend\n- Semi-finalist against Heiji\n- Tokyo MPD CSI officer\n- Kyoto-Senshin Kendo Tournament attendant and staff\n- Quarter-finalist lost against Okita\n- Kendo tournament manager\n",
    "Resolution": "Norimura then tries to explain he didn't have a box cutter himself so Heiji explains him it wasn't about a box cutter but rather that the \"cutter\" was bloody and useless and to bring him another one to which the blind Yasuoka confirms. In fact, the word \"cutter\" was in Kansai Dialect and it meant a dress shirt, it is revealed that Nukitani was talking to his wife on the phone and asking her to bring him another dress shirt since his' was bloody because, in a previous match where Okita was participating, his opponent pushed Nukitani so hard his nose bled.\nHis wife was currently on her way to bring him the shirt. Even if his shirt hadn't had blood on it, Norimura had planned to spill red ink on his shirt to make him come and lure him to kill him. The weapon was in fact his bamboo sword in which he used to make a sharp weapon by taking a single piece of bamboo and sharpened it and then swung it horizontally so the centrifugal force could cut someone's throat.\nThe sound people heard in the bathroom was in fact Norimura dulling the tip against the wall which meant that the proof (blood) will be easily found stuck in the inside of his sword bag. He then confesses and says he tried to wash it in the bathroom. Heiji laughs at Conan since he was the one who solved it. Norimura used a bamboo sword because he wanted to use his son's sword to avenge him.\n\nAfter winning a kendo match two years ago, Norimura’s son had accidentally struck a victory pose which is illegal to do after a kendo match had ended. As a result he was disqualified and lost the match, he felt such guilt because he had felt like he had let his entire school down all because of one simple mistake. As a result he decided to commit suicide out of guilt and as a form of redemption for his blunder.\nAlthough distraught, He first thought that his suicide was not anything to have a grudge against the referee, Nukitani, but, In the tournament, he saw that Nukitani ignored the victory pose done by a student of Tohto Senshin High School. He then went to talk with him and he had showed favoritism since they were both from Kansai which made him want to kill Nukitani.\nOkita then explains that the student was in fact brandishing a good luck charm that he gave him for the match and that it stuck out of his shirt. Nukitani then asked him to show him the charm and the student showed it which could look like a victory pose but it was not in fact. The student then cried so Nukitani comforted him and told him not to cry.\nNorimura in shock denies saying that it's so lie and grabs the bamboo sword and runs towards Okita and Heiji to attack them but he is knocked out by Ran's karate kick before Heiji and Okita could move. With commenting how strong she is, Ran then quickly grabs them and brings them to the tournament leaving Sato and Takagi perplexed.\n\n",
