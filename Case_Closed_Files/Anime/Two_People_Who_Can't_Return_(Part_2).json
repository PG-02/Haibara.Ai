    "Situation": "Ran and Sonoko invite their new classmate, Eisuke Hondou to visit Kogoro. At that moment, a client named Atsushi Misumi asks Kogoro to search for his girlfriend, Ami. Deducing from her last words, they realize Ami is waiting for Misumi at the place where they first met. They are driven by Misumi to Gunma Prefecture where they find Ami in a sealed up Nissan Fuga Y50 dead.\n\nMisumi breaks into the car by using a bat and breaking through the front window and proceeds to open the door by cutting open the tape from the passenger side. They discover that Ami died from carbon monoxide poisoning and conclude it to be suicide. Conan investigates and realizes it was a murder and believes Misumi's to be the murderer. He then continues to investigate in order to find out how Misumi was able to exit the car while the doors were sealed up with gaffer tape.\nAfter investigating, Conan realizes how the murder was done.\n",
    "People": "- 32 years old\n- Kogoro's client\n- Victim (poison)\n- Misumi's girlfriend\n- Gunma Prefectural Police forensics officer\n- Gunma Prefectural Police forensics officer\n",
    "Resolution": "Conan tranquilizes Kogoro and declares Atsushi Misumi to be the murderer. He reveals that Misumi drove Ami in that 2008 Nissan Fuga Y50 and drugged her to sleep. He then taped all the doors but made a cut along the passenger door allowing him to leave. Conan explains when Misumi broke into the car to save Ami, he only pretended to cut the passenger door open and that it was cut already.\nAs evidence to prove he was the murderer, Conan reveals that the book in the car came out on that same day and that Misumi's fingerprints were on the cover. However, Misumi reported that his girlfriend went missing yesterday. It's revealed that the book that Misumi brought was an attempt to win Ami's love back. Misumi tells everyone that he would do anything for Ami, whether it was to take a leave from work to go on vacation with her or stay in line overnight to get a concert ticket.\nIt was the same for the car; Ami wanted to try it out, so Misumi took out a loan to buy it for her. Unfortunately, Ami only saw Misumi as a servant than a boyfriend. Misumi found a cigarette in the car that he and Ami don't smoke, making Misumi realize that Ami was cheating on him. When Misumi confronted Ami about it, she seriously told Misumi she went out with another guy and said she had a great time.\n",
