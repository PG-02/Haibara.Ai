    "Situation": "Riichi Tengan, a popular ventriloquist, wants Kogoro to help himself from killing his wife Kazuko because he had always hallucinations that the doll he had wanted him to killed his wife. Few days later, the apprentice called Kogoro and tell that Kazuko was killed. Afterwards, Kogoro, Ran, and Conan go to the house and found the wife lying on the sofa.\n\nMegure confirms that the weapon used at the crime is the \"trophy\" and the only possible for the crime is the husband Riichi, because his fingerprints was found that the trophy but when Conan and Kogoro merely investigate, they found speakers on the different sides of the house and give it to Megure. When the forsenics tested it, Megure spilled out that the apprentice Haruomi had his fingerprints on the speakers, pointing him to be the suspect, but he denied that the speakers were gone missing last week. Later on, the police found out Haruomi's glasses with the victim's blood on it and he turned out to be the major suspect, but he denied and Megure said that its just a matter of time if he confessed. But Conan has that uneasy feeling that there's something wrong. Is Haruomi really the suspect?\n",
    "People": "- 40 years old\n- Popular ventriloquist\n- Kogoro's client\n- Victim (bludgeoned)\n- 35 years old\n- Riichi's wife\n- 28 years old\n- Riichi's pupil\n- Nurse\n- Riichi's doll and ventriloquism \"partner\"\n",
    "Resolution": "In order to make it appear that Togawa wanted to drive him into insanity, Tengan stole the speakers and recorder from Togawa and planted them inside his own house to be easily found. In addition, the sudden change of the act in the opening scene was meant to further \"confirm\" that he was already driven into insanity by the time he hired Kogoro. This was all meant to initially cast suspicion on himself, only to have him cleared by both pinning the blame on his apprentice and claiming innocence by reason of his \"induced\" split personality.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is the first time that Conan uses his Voice-Changing Bowtie to impersonate an inanimate object which, in this case, a puppet.\n- The painting in Tengan's apartment is the Suzuki Art Museum from Munch's Missing Scream.\n"
