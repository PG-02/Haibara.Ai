    "Situation": "Kogoro takes Ran, Kazuha, Conan, and Heiji to the Inubushi household where they are introduced to the family. They learn about the legend passed down in the Inubushi family where their ancestor set his dog on fire after mistakenly assuming the dog killed his daughter while in reality, the dog saved his daughter. The ancestor was then killed in a house fire and the myth of the Inubushi curse was passed down. Conan and Heiji decide to investigate the headstone of the supposed dog when they witness Saki Inubushi fall from a cliff. Saki claims an ablaze demon dog chased her and dies shortly after.\n\n\n\nConan and Heiji discover flaming dog-prints atop the cliff establishing Saki's story. Inspector Misao Yamamura is called to the scene and joins them on their investigation. They discover that the other three victims had a pachinko ball, table tennis ball, and marble beside their bodies. Conan and Heiji return to Saki's crime scene to investigate. Ran and Kazuha feed the family dog and are confronted by the demon dog.\nRan and Kazuha retreat inside the house and discover the demon dog is gone. Conan and Heiji's investigation leads them to find conclusive evidence Saki's death was planned by the culprit. After hearing Ran and Kazuha's story, they realize the culprit is housing the inugami nearby and investigate an abandoned cabin. Inside the cabin yeilds evidence of a dog living there. Nearby, Tomoaki Inubashi is pounced by the demon dog and receives minor burns; nearby an onion is found.\n\nHeiji asks Miyuki Inubashi about the family history and learns that Tsunechika had planned names for all eight of his illegitimate children which are based on the eight virtues of confucianism.\nSatomi attempts to leave her room and collapses; she is found holding onto a broken Buddhist prayer beads with a black bead four down from the top.\n",
