    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Rumi Wakasa's neighbour is a pro-golfer named Teigo Banno. He has just won his first tournament in Japan and is about to move to the US to win even bigger titles. He talks to his girlfriend about his plans and asks her to return the spare key to his apartment. The conversation becomes an argument when he informs her he is going to the US alone. He wants to start his new life with a 'clean slate' and tells her they're breaking up. His girlfriend is a model, Kurumi Iiyama, who threatens him with a lawsuit of 100 Million Yen, relying on the power of her father, who is a lawyer. He calms her down and invites her to dinner to resolve the feud. While she is leaving, he murmurs, \"This will be our last supper together.\" Wakasa overhears their conversation.\nThe next day, we see Conan rehearsing his lines as 'Ikkyu' for the school play. Kobayashi-sensei, Rumi-sensei, and Conan's classmates are astonished by his incredible acting and the delivery of his lines. Conan had played 'Ikkyu-san' like Shinichi before, and his parents had trained him well. This is why, despite missing several rehearsals as Conan, he remembered most of his lines.\nDuring the clean-up and preparation for the play, Wakasa accidentally spills the bucket used to wash off the paint brushes over her painting of the tiger. She says that she'd repaint it without any problem, but the reference photo she used is in her apartment, and she'd need Conan to match the scale of the painting correctly. Conan and the Detective Boys agree to accompany her to her apartment. While arriving, they see a lady wearing a hat and sunglasses knocking at the door of Wakasa's neighbour, Banno. When her neighbour doesn't respond, she bangs on the door in a rage, clicks her tongue and leaves. After the Detective Boys and Wakasa are done painting and having a meal served by Wakasa to show her appreciation, loud music starts playing in her neighbour's apartment. When the music doesn't seem to stop, Genta goes to complain with the others following him. To their astonishment, they find two people lying on the floor with a pool of blood under the woman's head.\n\nThe neighbour, Teigo Banno, wakes up and is frightened when he lays eyes on the body beside him. The bludgeoned victim was his girlfriend, Kurumi. Megure arrives with his team and starts investigating. Teigo says that a lady with sunglasses and a hat came and made him unconscious with a stun gun. When his girlfriend walked in on and witnessed the action, she was killed. The culprit wrote 'I love you'(愛してる) on his face. The two polaroid photos lying next to him prove it. The Detective Boys try to convict the boyfriend of the murder, but the evidence seems to be on his side. Wakasa finally mentions Teigo's encounter with his girlfriend she witnessed the day before.\nRumi-sensei and the kids are back in Rumi's apartment, where Conan informs them that he suspects Banno is the murderer. Conan finds a convenience store receipt dated that morning under his sitting mat as they discuss how he did it. This causes Conan to remember she was late this morning. When asked why, Rumi says she went to the convenience store in the morning because her fridge was empty. The time school usually sells a lot of items outlets out. As a result, she was late for school, which is an uncommon occurrence for her. Conan, Mitsuhiko, and Wakasa overhear Takagi and Megure discussing the case and walk in on Haibara, trying to write on her face using her phone as a mirror but failing miserably. She can't erase the funny scribble that's supposed to be 'A' (あ) because she accidentally used a permanent marker. We then learn that Genta fell asleep on the painting and wakes up with a tiger mark on his face from  the paint. Also we learn Genta's hand smells of ladies' foundation.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (bludgeoned - injured)\n- 32 years old\n- Professional golfer\n- Kurumi's boyfriend\n- Victim (bludgeoned)\n- 29 years old\n- Model\n- Lawyer's daughter\n- Shinichi, Sonoko, and Ran's homeroom teacher\n- Teigo's neighbour\n- Kurumi's fan\n",
    "Resolution": "- Teigo didn't touch his face when Haibara told him that something was written on it so that he could preserve the crafted evidence.\n- The suspicious woman in question was the same height as Teigo.\n- Teigo recognized that the writing was not of his girlfriend on a mirrored phone screen without seeing Kurumi's handwriting.\n- No handwriting matches were found amongst his fan letters.\n- The foundation smell on Genta's hand came from when he knocked on the same spot on the door where the suspicious woman had. Teigo disguised his dark skin using foundation even on his hands, which actual women don't.\n- After he said that he was tasered, no one checked for taser burn marks, which probably would not have been found unless he had tasered himself, which he probably did not do. The lack of taser marks would overturn all other evidence in his favor since he is lying about being tased.\nTeigo Banno disguised as the suspicious woman and killed his girlfriend. He used a plastic wrap to transfer the writing to his face. He exchanged the sleeves and applied foundation on Kurumi's hand to disguise it as his in the photo.\nHe wanted to start his golf tour abroad with a blank slate, but his girlfriend demanded 100 million yen as compensation for breaking up with her.\n",

    "Trivia": "- The camera used by the mysterious lady to take a picture of Teigo Banno is a Fujifilm Instax Mini 8.\n- Inspector Megure and Detective Takagi's police car is a Toyota Crown Sedan 2011. The license plate number is 新宿 800, れ 23-86 (Shinjuku 800, Re 23-86).\n- The names of the suspects are related to golf[1]:\n- Teigo Ban'no (伴野 貞悟, バンノ テイゴ in katakana) refers to a \"birdie\" (バーディー ,Bādī?);\n- Kurumi Iiyama (飯山 来美, イイヤマ クルミ in katakana) refers to an \"eagle\" (イーグル ,Īguru?);\n- The name Yuto Adachi (安達 佑斗) on the autograph is a reference to real-life Shonen Sunday editor Yuto Adachi.\n- You would think that if someone said that they were tasered to the police, the first thing that they would check would be for the taser burn mark, however, the police seemed to completely take his word for it, without any proof that he had, and most likely he never really tasered himself.\n- The crow at the end of episode is a sign that either Kuroda or Wakita is Rum. This might be a speculation on the viewer's perspective. Since the color of the crow is black, this might led the viewer to assume that either of the two of them is Rum, which is part of the Black Organization.\n",
