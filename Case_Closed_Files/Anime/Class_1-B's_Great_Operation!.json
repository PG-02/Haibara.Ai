    "Situation": "The teacher of the Detective Boys decides to give the class a mental test. Conan is called by the teacher so the class must solve it without him. They solve it with the help of two silent out-casted students. It turns out it was a plan to include the new students so they feel more involved.\nThe code contains numbers were assigned to members of the class: Mitsuhiko got the 1, Ayumi the 2, Conan the 3, Maria Higashio the 4, Genta the 5, Takuma Sakamoto the 6. Genta's number was the only one to be red. The students then found a paper with dice numbers, in the order 3-1-6-2-4-5, the 1 being the only red. As Conan was called out, Haibara had to play Conan's role to make the students work together to solve the code and called his name whenever Conan's name is mentioned in the solving process.\n",

The solution of the code was \"Ongakushitsu\" (music room).\n- Higashio Maria - 4 - O\n- Kojima Genta - 5 - N\n- Edogawa Conan - 3 - Ga\n- Sakamoto Takuma - Ku\n- Yoshida Ayumi - Shi\n- Tsuburaya Mitsuhiko - Tsu\n",

    "Remastered version": "A remastered version of this case was aired on March 26, 2011, due to production delay for episode 610 caused by 2011 Tōhoku earthquake.\n"
