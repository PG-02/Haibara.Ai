    "The Cavern of the Detective Boys (Manga: 251-254, Anime: 188-189)": "Ran is practicing for her princess role in a play that Sonoko wrote for their campus festival. Conan and her father object to who her partner is for the said play since she had to kiss someone. Just as Ran decides to take a quick shower for her practice, she is told that the shower is broken. Conan also wanted to take one so he asks Ran if she wants to go with him to Professor Agasa's house and take a shower there. When Ran comes over, Haibara goes to the basement for some important research and says she doesn't want to be bothered by anyone. Later, the Detective boys go to a camping site and find a limestone cavern. The gang decides to explore the cavern and Genta discovers a corpse and people disposing of it.\n\nOne culprit notices them so he shoots and seriously wounds Conan.\n\nThe Detective Boys search for an exit while running away from the culprit, and they managed to outrun them, but get trapped in a dead end passage. They hear from the murderers that there is one exit, but all the other passages in the cavern are dead ends. The branches are arranged in an unusual fashion and their is a strange pedestal with a round shaped stone on it. Conan passes out from his injury, but manages to relay a final hint to the detective boys on which passage to take.\n- Robber\n- Robber leader\n- Robber\n- Victim (gunshot)\n\n\n",
    "The Wounded Great Detective (Manga: 254-255, Anime: 189-190)": "As they rush the wounded Conan to the hospital, he is in need of a blood transfusion. Ran immediately offers her blood saying she has the same blood type as Conan does, and he thinks Ran already knows he is Shinichi.\nRecovering in the hospital from his bullet wound, Conan contemplates telling Ran his true identity, since, Ran was already certain of who he was as she knew Conan's blood-type when she donated her blood, the same as Shinichi's. Additionally, Heiji and Kazuha drop by to visit him and Heiji warns him that it's best to be true, so he should tell Ran everything.\nBut Ai Haibara shows up and points a gun at him. She reveals that the Black Organization knew of her real identity and betrayal, but were willing to re-recruit her, as long as she kills Conan as well as the people who know who he is: his family, Agasa, Ran and Heiji.\n- Beika General Hospital nurse\n- Beika General Hospital doctor\n\n\n",
    "The Third Choice and The Black Knight (Manga: 254-257, Anime: 190-191)": "Later Ran is cast in a school play, while discussing the play with her friends, Conan shows up wearing a face mask due to a cold he had. Ran is supposed to play a beautiful princess who is rescued and protected by a mysterious Black Knight. Sonoko was originally cast as the Knight but has injured her arm so she cannot act, so Dr. Araide (who works as an aidé for a sports club in the school) is supposed to be the Knight now.\nDuring the play Ran's \"princess\" is abducted by bandits (causing Kazuha, who is in the audience, to start screaming at them to leave her alone), but then she's saved by the Black Knight. Said knight has his face shrouded, so at first everyone thinks it's Araide, but the Black Knight appears to go off script embracing her and is about to kiss her, much to the horror of Kogoro, but the romantic scene is disrupted when a man in the audience falls dead, seemingly by potassium cyanide poisoning in a drink.\n\nThis last detail is revealed by a young man in the audience who seemingly turns out to be Shinichi Kudo, but is quickly revealed by Kazuha to be Heiji in disguise. After a series of questionings Heiji, although unsure of how the victim was poisoned was certain that the murderer was one of four prime suspects. The police are unable to find the source of the poison from the drinks. As they are able to rule the death as a suicide, the still masked \"Black Knight\" declares it was a murder.\n- 27 years old\n- Audience member\n- Beika General Hospital guard\n- 28 years old\n- Audience member\n- Beika General Hospital clerical employee\n- 27 years old\n- Audience member\n- Beika General Hospital nurse\n- Victim (poison)\n- 28 years old\n- Audience member\n- Beika General Hospital doctor\n- 18 years old\n- Teitan High School senior\n- Drink seller\n- Kohei's former fiancée\n\n\n",
    "Shinichi's Return and The Promised Place (Manga: 258-260, Anime: 192-193)": "The next day, Shinichi takes Ran to a fancy restaurant in order to confess his love. Meanwhile, a man named Satoru Ooba kisses his girlfriend. When the elevator opens up behind her, he shoots and murders, Taiji Tatsumi, his boss and his girlfriend's father.\n\nBefore Shinichi could confess, he investigates the murder and realizes Ooba is the murderer.\n- Victim (gunshot)\n- 58 years old\n- Game company chief executive\n- 31 years old\n- Game company department head\n- 26 years old\n- Taiji's daughter\n- Restaurant waitress\n- Deceased (suicide)\n- Satoru's late father\n- Company president\n\nShinichi, who has resoved the case despite being under the effects of the cure wearing off, escapes to the bathroom and regresses back to Conan. Ai, who is still masquerading as Conan, shows up and tells him the time limit is almost over, and she returns him his smaller clothes.\nthumb|right|200px|Conan says the words of Shinichi to Ran.\nNow fully shrunk, Conan returns to Ran's side in the restaurant. He tells her that Kogoro is waiting in the parking lot, and that Shinichi both left a credit card to pay for the meal *and* has left to resolve other cases. The heartbroken and tearful Ran covers her ears and says she doesn't want to hear any other excuses from Shinichi even if delivered by someone else, but Conan says Shinichi \"told him\" that he will come back someday even if it costs him his own life, and asks Ran to wait for his return, as he wants to tell her something important when he does.\n",
