    "Mizusawa's murder": "The one who killed Mizusawa is Hiromichi Umeki. Mizusawa had seen that Umeki had stolen the jewel in the glove-box of in the 10 minutes time span because he took a picture at 9:41 where the box was closed and one at 9:51 when it was open, 6 minutes after his report at 9:45. Wanting to talk to him, he called him to the real estate agency and called Kogoro as well planning to turn Umeki in but Umeki couldn't hand over the jewel since he was in debt to gambling associations so he took a rope and strangled Mizusawa.\nHe then deleted the phone's data which contained the evidence of the robbery and set up a trick by putting a candle on a world map which would burn the other books near it and cause a big fire when the candle melted enough. The only one with an alibi at the time of the fire is Umeki which raises suspicion on him and plus, his uncle, Tatsuma, told the police that Umeki knew about the Tears of Borgia since he told him about it numerous times. Upon being arrested, he hands over the jewel which proves to be fake because of Hideo Senju's expertise and wanted to crush it but is stopped by Sumire who says it's the last memory of her grandmother.\n",
    "Last scene of \"I Killed Them\"": "The last scene showed the maid, Nagisa, peeling apples and among the apples seeing a manifesto from Red Hood which causes her to panic and hold the knife next to the door. Masao, the butler, shows up and tells her what's wrong but his suspicious grin and the fact that he is holding a can makes the maid realize that he is Red Hood. The maid then proceeds to stab Red Hood to death while falling unconscious because of the shock.\n",
    "What happened to Yuri Saeki": "While Kanoya was shooting the last scene, Yuri was charged by the Asahinas to bring the Tears of Borgia but, since she loved Senju and believed his words that the jewel was fake, she resigned bringing it to them because she didn't want the family to embarrass themselves due to the fake gem. She wanted to tell the truth to Nagisa Asahina which is why she sneaked through the window but Nagisa, stressed out because of her fever and the fact that Yuri arrived late, tried to take back the Tears of Borgia while Yuri Saeki tried to dispose of it resulting in Nagisa stabbing Yuri with the knife she used to peel the apples with.\nYuri fell down the hill and crawled to her car before trying to bury the secret of the fake jewel and Nagisa's guilt with her as farthest as possible and drove the car into the lake locking away the secret forever until forty years later when the lake dried up. Nagisa, unable to bear her guilt, finishes shooting the last scene with her true emotions before falling unconscious because of her fever. She then developed a mental illness due to it.\n",
