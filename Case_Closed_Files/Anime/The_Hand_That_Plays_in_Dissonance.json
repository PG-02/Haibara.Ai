    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan all attend a concert at the local department store. After the drummer, Yusuke Nakamura, hears about a CD Ran is searching for, he tells her to follow him to the storage room where he has a copy of it. While there, they discover the lead vocalist, Yukiko Watanabe, dead in the storage room.\n\nThe band is interrogated by the police and they learn Yukiko planned to join another band. Ran tells Conan she noticed that the drum outside of the storage room changed position and Conan realizes who the murderer is.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (strangled)\n- 24 years old\n- Vocalist\n- 25 years old\n- Guitarist\n- 27 years old\n- Bassist\n- 22 years old\n- Keyboardist\n- 30 years old\n- Drummer\n- Band leader\n- 38 years old\n- TMS Records music producer\n- Beika Department store security guard\n",
    "Resolution": "Yusuke confesses that the band is his life and he thought they felt the same. Then, after Yukiko talking to Yuuki, Yusuke witnessed it and say, \"You and Shouta were rumored to have been recruited into that new band. So, it was true, wasn't it?\" She then said, \"Yeah, that's right, is that a problem?\" He then said, \"You, when you were in your previous band, you tried to sell yourself to the recording company but ended up being kicked out. Isn't it thanks to us that you could still continue your singing career?\" She then said pathetically, \"Don't make me laugh, you should be thanking me for joining so that your band could continue at all, if it weren't for me, a band this shabby would have already fallen apart!\" He then said, \"How dare you!\" She then said, \"You've served as my stepping stone to my major debut that's reason enough to thank me.\" Yukiko laughed haughtily and Yusuke strangled her.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Veteran staff from the early stage of Detective Conan (Haruo Ogawara and Akio Kawamura) returned to the anime production, which led to some unsteady animations within this episode.\n- The song at the beginning of the episode is the ending to Mysterious. The band then proceeds to play Everlasting Luv. It is also stated that Kogoro has never heard those songs.\n- The song \"Moonlady\" by Yoko Okino was referenced again.
