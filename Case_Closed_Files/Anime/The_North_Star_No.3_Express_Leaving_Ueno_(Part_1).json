    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Conan, Kogoro, and Ran take the overnight North Star Express to Hokkaido to meet a former client. On the train, they meet up with a series of people. However, in the night, a murder case occurs when a burglar seemingly kills a jewelry trader, and escapes through the window.\n\nThe train stops to find his dead body outside.\n\nConan noticed that the plot is very similar to an unpublished novel written by his father that had been stolen ten years before. However, unable to contact Yusaku Kudo, Conan takes the case into his own hands, and finds his mother on the train.\nConan reveals to the suspicious woman that he knows her identity - it is Yukiko Kudo, his mother, in disguise. As they discuss the case, Kogoro calls all the passengers to witness his inaccurate deduction, enabling Conan to figure out the trick. However, a worried Conan recalls that in the novel, the detective boy who solved the case was murdered by the trap he set for the criminal. Yukiko volunteers to act as a decoy to help him find the proof.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (bludgeoned)\n- 39 years old\n- Passenger\n- 38 years old\n- Jewelry store manager\n- Victim (gunshot)\n- 56 years old\n- Jewelry store owner\n- 67 years old\n- Furuito City mayor\n- 32 years old\n- Passenger\n- 37 years old\n- Passenger\n- 49 years old\n- Keitaro's wife\n- Inspector from Hokkaido Prefecture Police\n- Detective from Hokkaido Prefecture Police\n",
    "Resolution": "When the train lands at Sapporo Station, however, Conan and Yukiko are separated and the criminal moves, intending to push her onto the tracks.\nYusaku appears just in time and reveals the trick and his own identity to the criminal, who had idolized his work. The culprit is Toshinori Kaetsu.\nKaetsu dressed like Asama and made people believe that he jump off the train by using his fishing equipment. First, he hit Asama in the head until he died and broke the window using silenced gun. Then, he put the fishing line through the belt loop on the back of his pants and hung him outside the window. He tied the side of the fishing line to the pulley and the other to something stable outside the room. Lastly, he used another fishing line, looped one end, and put a piece of tape through it. He passed the other end into the lock and tied the end to the line he cut. After that, he went to the lobby car, shot Izumo, and ran back to Asama's room. He opened the door and fired some shots to make people believe he shattered the window then. He saw Kogoro and the conductors following him, so he shot at them. While they were shielding themselves from the bullets, he went to hide himself next to the stairs and cut the fishing line to release the string from the pulley so the corpse will be released. When the line was cut, the corpse would drag the fishing line tied to the door down. The dragging force released the tape but the inertia made the door close completely.  He used this trick to framed Asama on the murder of Izumo. He chose to operate in the tunnel in the middle of the night because he didn't want people off the train to see the corpse hanging off. Also, the hallway was dark so no one would see the fishing line tied to the room. Lastly, he put sleeping pills in his wife's dinner box so she couldn't hear the gunshot. The shirt the criminal used is found on his luggage together with the disguise outfit. This is the evidence that he is really the culprit.\nKaetsu admitted the two murders and revealed he imitated the unpublished novel of a famous novelist that he likes. He, Asama and a female accomplice were members of the robbing gang. It is the accomplice who is his girlfriend dies of over consume drugs. Kaetsu left the gang and planned to avenge both Asuma for forcing his girlfriend to over consume drugs and Izumo for selling his girlfriend drugs. He had Asama rob Izumo's jewelry store but Izumo didn't know anything, he pressed the alert bell and Asama escaped. He later planned to have both Izumo and Asama to take the overnight North Star Express. Yusaku asks if he follows the incomplete novel of Yusaku and uses it to construct the murders, much to Kaetsu's surprise until Yusaku reveals himself to be the author of that unfished novel. After being convinced by Yusaku, Kaetsu surrendered. Yusaku and Yukiko flew back to Los Angeles.\n",

    "Quotes": "- Extracts from Yusaku Kudo's novel:\n- Yusaku Kudo (to the culprit ):\nIf you felt in any way moved by my novel... I'll recommend you to turn yourself in. Because the killer in that novel in the end was scheduled to turn himself into the police after regretting all that he did.  (もしもあなたが私の小説に少しでも感銘を受けられたのなら…自首する事をお勧めしたい。あの小説の犯人は、ラストで全ての罪を悔いて警察に出頭する予定でしたから。)\n- Yusaku Kudo recounting jokes after the case has been solved:\nYukiko Kudo: But I sure sense fate, for you to come and save me just in the nick of time.  (工藤有希子「でも運命だよねー私の大ピンチに間一髪で駆けつけてくれるんだもの。」)\nYusaku Kudo: In the nick of time? I was there near you from about two minutes before everything happened.  (工藤優作「間一髪？オレは２分ぐらい前からずっどおまえのそばにいたが…」)\nYukiko Kudo: Huh? Then what? You mean you waited doing something until I was almost pushed?  (工藤有希子「え？じゃーなーに？私が突き飛ばさせる寸前まで黙って見てたってわけ？」)\nYusaku Kudo: Yes. I wanted to be sure that he was the killer. Besides, the stage of the novel was the Seikan Tunnel. So, I silently watch over you.[N 2]  (工藤優作「ああ…あの人が犯人だという確証が欲しかったし…それになんたってトリックの舞台は青函トンネル…黙って静観してたというわけさ！」)\nYukiko Kudo: He gives me the shivers.  (工藤有希子「さむいわね…」)\nConan Edogawa: It is Hokkaido, after all.  (江戸川コナン「ああ…北海道だからな…」)\n",
