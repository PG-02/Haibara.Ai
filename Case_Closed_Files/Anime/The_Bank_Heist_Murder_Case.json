    "Situation": "After bowling, Ran, Sonoko, and Conan head to the bank to cash a check. While there, an armed bank robbery happens. After some struggle, one man is shot by the robber but survives. After being shot, another man struggles with the robber and ends up shooting and killing the robber. It all seems normal but Conan finds it strange. After figuring out the robber had an accomplice, Conan, using Sonoko, reveals the robber's accomplice.\n\n\n\n",
    "People": "- College student\n- 60 years old\n- Tohto Bank employee\n- 45 years old\n- Tohto Bank North Beika Park Branch manager\n- Tohto Bank employee\n- Victim (gunshot - injured)\n- 28 years old\n- Tohto Bank employee\n- Victim (gunshot)\n- 27 years old\n- Birth date: 1970\n- Robber\n- Tetsuya's lover and client\n",
    "Resolution": "The two of them had been signaling each other via phone call, if Saeki was in any trouble Taniguchi would call his phone to alert him of said danger. However, this backfired when Taniguchi called his cellphone to alert him of Tetsuya’s ambush, Tetsuya mistakenly believed that it was his cellphone that was ringing and froze up as a result a panicked Saeki shot him.\nSeeing this caused Taniguchi to kill him due to him panicking as well. The evidence that links the two of them is cough drops. Before arriving at the bank Taniguchi met with Saeki and while talking with him saw that he had a cold, so he gave him half of a bar of his cough drops. Later Taniguchi gave the other half to Conan as he had a cold as well.\nDuring the robbery Saeki had used up all his cough drops, but remembered that Taniguchi still had some left. So threw down the wrapper onto the floor and looked through his jacket not knowing that he already gave the cough drops away to Conan. When the two wrappers are put together they match perfectly proving that Taniguchi and Saeki are accomplices.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Touru Saeki's pistol is a Cybergun Desert Eagle .50AE GBB.\n- In this case, Conan sure finds difficult to talk like a girl, in contrast to previous times, when he talked like Sonoko with no problem.\n",
