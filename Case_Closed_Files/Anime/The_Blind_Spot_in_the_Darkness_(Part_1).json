    "Situation": "Conan as Shinichi calls Ran but she's got something do and someplace to go. Conan muses that Ran must have something going on, something that's making her happy with anticipation.\nNext, Kogoro Mouri gets Ran and Conan in the car and drives them to the office of his doctor, Yoshiteru Araide, who had insisted that he bring his family. While they're all in the doctor's home-based office, Ran asks the doctor's wife to use their bathroom. On the way there, she bumps into the doctor's young, altruistic, brilliant and very handsome son; she knocks a sheaf of papers from his hands, and experiences a significant touch from his hand to the top of hers when picking up the papers.\nLater, after accepting an invitation to dinner there, both Kogoro and the doctor's wife Yoko cheerfully suggest that the son, Tomoaki Araide, and Ran marry. Logically, Conan gets jealous BIG time.\nHowever, Yoshiteru gets electrocuted to death when taking a bath.\n\nConan is quick to discover the cause for Dr. Araide's death: his electric razor has fallen into the filled tub, electrocuting him. Though it seems that Dr. Araide must have dropped the razor himself, Conan notices that some things don't quite add up: Why was Dr. Araide sitting with his back to the mirror mounted at the end of the bathtub when he was shaving? And where did Hikaru get the burn mark on her arm? But what distracts Conan from the case is that Ran and Tomoaki seems strangely drawn to each other, and a disconcerting thought dawns inside him: Could Ran have become interested in Tomoaki now? He is a rather handsome and popular fellow, after all...\nWhile Kogoro, Megure, and Takagi test all possible scenarios, Conan discovers several clues missed by the police and adds them up to the solution of the case. And as usual, he stuns Kogoro to use him as a mouthpiece to deliver his conclusions. But poor Tomoaki vehemently protests the questionings, claiming that none of his family could have done such a thing.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (electrocuted)\n- 51 years old\n- Local practitioner\n- Tomoaki's father\n- Married into the Araide family\n- 46 years old\n- Yoshiteru's second wife\n- Tomoaki's step-mother\n- 25 years old\n- Doctor\n- Yoshiteru's son\n- 22 years old\n- Housemaid\n- 74 years old\n- Tomoaki's grandmother\n- Deceased\n- Yoshiteru's first wife\n- Tomoaki's mother\n- Mitsu's daughter\n- Yoko's friend\n- Teitan High School's basketball coach\n- Yoshiteru's patient\n- Yoshiteru's secret lover\n",
    "Resolution": "- First, Yoko set up a timer somewhere in the house in advance to create a blackout during the time of murder.\n- After Hikaru left for the breaker toward the end of the hall, Yoko switched from the house phone's main handset to the branch phone (which is wireless) and headed to the bathroom with a penlight while still talking to her friend. On the way, she used a mobile phone to call the house phone in order to temporary stop the conversation in order to carry out the murder.\n- Once she arrived at the bathroom, Yoko distracted Yoshiteru by pointing the penlight at his face, using that moment to put the shaver's cord into the tub. She then told Yoshiteru to grab onto the metal bar for safety, left the bathroom, resumed her conversation, and quickly returned back to the kitchen and switched back to the main handset.\n- Finally, Yoshiteru would then be electrocuted to death after Hikaru turned the breaker back on, creating a situation that every members of the household had solid alibis during the time of the murder, with Yoko herself planning to testify that she \"never saw anyone heading to the bathroom\".\n- However, Yoko's plan ran into a problem because Hikaru took time during the blackout to go hide a broken egg custard cup in her room, making her unable to establish an alibi during the time frame.\n- Since Hikaru had to use the time to rush to her room to the second floor from the garden in the middle of the house and then back to the breaker, she couldn't commit the murder, and neither did Mitsu who was injured from a cup's fragment that Hikaru dropped on the second floor, nor Tomoaki who was hugged by Ran during the entire blackout could do it either, all of which points to Yoko being the only person capable of murdering Yoshiteru.\n",
    "Motive": "Confronted with the tricks she had used, Yoko confesses. She explains that she murdered her husband because her predecessor and Tomoaki's mother Chiaki, who was also her best friend, had succumbed to depression, alcoholism and eventually committed suicide because of Dr. Araide's continuous acts of adultery. She didn't try to hurt Tomoaki not just because he was innocent, but because right before her death, Chiaki asked her to help him through his life.\nSince the frail and gentle Hikaru had unintentionally caused her employer’s death and would understandably have blamed herself if she ever learned the truth, Conan (as Kogoro) and Yoko agree to change the details of the procession of events to \"Yoko drugged Yoshiteru and used a timer to electrocute him to death, and used the blackout to retrieve the murder weapon\", so that Hikaru would never be burdened by her conscience.\n",
