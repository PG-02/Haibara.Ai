    "Situation": "Kogoro and Conan discovered a corpse on the street while taking a stroll. Seemingly, the deceased have been hit in the head with a metal pipe, and remained a dying message that looks like \"1-1-2\". The estimated time of death is around 9PM last night, Conan visited the deceased's apartment.\n\nAccording to the apartment manager, no one seem to hold grudge with the victim Komoda. Owing to the fact that Komoda doesn't have a job and claimed yesterday afternoon that he will pay off all of his unpaid apartment rent tomorrow, Kogoro deduces that he must be blackmailing people for a living, and Komoda might be anti-killed by his blackmailed target.\nThe manager added that Komoda noticed the photo of Tosuke Utagawa on the magazine, who is the CEO of Utagawa Corporation. And declared that Utagawa would be the perfect target for him to blackmail, due to his wealth. The police talked to the CEO, Utagawa. He seemed rather arrogant, and he doesn't have an alibi when the crime was carried out. Up until now, he looks like the person who would kill Komoda for a plausible reason.\nTomoe Izumi, the lady that they encountered in the crime scene, said that yesterday morning Komoda approached her to consult about Juichi Innami, who was a her former resident. Innami had been gone for ten days and had only came back the other night. However, he claimed that he was moving away. Izumi showed a video with the appearance of Innami which shocked everyone, Innami looks exactly identical with the CEO Utagawa. Are they the same person?\nAfter a long time of reasoning, another possibility emerged. Innami may be a substitute of Utagawa for fabricating certain alibi, in the premise of their exact same appearances. Kogoro said that it's possible that Komoda blackmailed Utagawa by taking advantage over this matter, and Innami might be killed by Utagawa after the alibi was fabricated. Later, they found out that there was a reward ceremony that was held within Utagawa's company on the evening of 9th. This leads to the assumption that Innami might've substituted Utagawa to attend the ceremony. However, by doing fingerprint analysis, the fingerprints on the winner award tend to matched with Utagawa's. This means that it was the real CEO who attended the ceremony, the investigation went into a stalemate once again.\nConan thinks there's more behind this case, and finally discovers a shocking truth.\n",
    "People": "- 42 years old\n- Utagawa Corporation CEO\n- Victim (beaten)\n- 25 years old\n- Birthday: July 4th\n- Unemployed\n- 70 years old\n- Apartment landlady\n- 60 years old\n- Apartment manager\n- Missing\n- Tomoe's former resident\n- Tosuke's lookalike\n- Tosuke's secretary\n- Tomoe's dog\n- Border collie\n- Utagawa Corporation Photo Award Ceremony MC\n",
    "Resolution": "The proof that exposed his real identity was that he used his left hand while digging. Utagawa was killed after exchanging appearences. This explains why the fingerprints on the winner award matched with the CEO's, that's because it was Innami's, while substituting for Utagawa. This implies that the police have never met the real Utagawa at the outset. After Komoda's witness of murder in the park, he started blackmailing Innami, he apparently complied with all the agreements, but secretly killed Komoda. Therefore, Komoda's blackmailing target wasn't Togawa but Innami. In addition, Innami disclosed the reason Utagawa hired him for the substitution, it was solely that he needed some time off from his company matters.\nHis motive was simply that he wanted to feel like an important person, just like how he desired. Megure says that he even though he achieved his goal for a little time, he killed two men and that was unforgivable.\n",
