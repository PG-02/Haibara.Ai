    "Trivia": "- In this episode, TMS Entertainment hired a new company for production cooperation: Luminas. By looking at the staff involved in key animation and in-between animation, it can be seen that they have once again subcontracted their work into two additional Chinese animation companies: Shiyue Animation and Yueling Animation.\n- Other than Satsuki Makabe, the other people who resented Doba on Takagi's list are: Hayato Kageyama (影山 隼), Isamu Sasamoto (笹本 勇) and Nobuo Toyama (外山 信夫).\n- Doba's car in the accident three years ago was a Toyota Supra, 4th Generation. Its license plate was 新宿 332, ち 30-01 (Shinjuku 332, Chi 30-01). His car is later an Audi TT Mk3. Its license plate is 新宿 331, ね 92-12 (Shinjuku 331, Ne 92-12).\n- Anime-original locations: Ganbe Town (頑辺町) and Ochibadai (落葉台).\n"
