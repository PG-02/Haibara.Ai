    "Resolution": "\nRan realizes where she has seen Kokusho before, she is actually a stuntwoman, which explains how she was barely injured after her recent cliff fall. After Kokusho has done speaking, she attempts to kill Conan and Ran as they would act as eyewitnesses against her. Conan attempts to tranquilize Kokusho, but his wrist-watch was broken from a previous hit and this leads to Conan receiving a second hit. Taisei and Kogoro arrive just in time to the scene, with Kogoro taking down Kokusho with his signature judo throw. Even though Taisei witnessed Kogoro capturing the culprit of his daughter's death, his sadness still lingers after everything that has happened.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is the second case to promote tourism in Kagoshima Prefecture, the first being Kogoro Gets Drunk in Satsuma, which aired in February of 2005 and focused mainly on Kagoshima's Satsuma Shōchū, a spirit distilled from sweet potatoes in southern Kyushu. It mainly focused on the cities of Tarumizu and Kagoshima, as well as the former town of Sakurajima, which merged into Kagoshima in 2004. This case is the first however to focus on a location outside of mainland Kagoshima Prefecture, in the town of Yakushima on the island of the same name.\n- Likewise, this episode was partnered with Kagoshima Yomiuri Television (KYT), and featured real-life announcers Asami Yokoyama and Naoyuki Uchida, just like Kogoro Gets Drunk in Satsuma featured real-life announcer Yuka Tokuzumi. KYT will also organize a special exhibit related to the Yamahime Legend in February 2025 and a limited-merchandise event will take place in Kagoshima City in March[2].\n- Kagopita (かごピタ) was a real-life evening news program which ran from October 3, 2014 to March 29, 2024 and was hosted by Uchida and Yokoyama. It was succeeded on April 6, 2024 by the morning news program \"Kagopita Familiar\" (かごピタFAMILIAR), shown in the case.\n- The Hidakas' surname (日高) originates from Kagoshima Prefecture, originating from the \"Hidaka\" branch of the Seiwa Genji clan from Satsuma and Ōsumi provinces, nowadays Kagoshima and Miyazaki Prefectures. It is also common on Yakushima, with 13% of residents having the surname. Taisei Hidaka's voice actor Kozo Shioya is also from Kagoshima[3]. Kitabeppu's last name (北別府) is mostly found in Kagoshima Prefecture, mainly in Soo City[4]. Lastly, Kokushō (国生) also originates from Kagoshima Prefecture[5].\n- The supermarket Yamamoto works at is the real-life coop-owned A-COOP Miyanoura Store in Miyanoura, Yakushima.\n- The \"SAPO\" beer Kogoro drinks at the restaurant is named after Sapporo Beer.\n- The hotel the Mouri Family stays at is the Samana Hotel Yakushima.\n- Kitabeppu's car is a white Nissan Silvia S15. The license plate is 屋久島 330, に · 5 50 (Yakushima 330, Ni · 5 50).\n- The hospital Kokusho is taken to is the real-life Yakushima Tokushokai Hospital (屋久島徳洲会病院).\n- Taisei Hidaka's car is a dark turquoise Toyota Corolla (E120). The license plate is 屋久島 503, す 24·98 (Yakushima 503, Su 24·98).\n",
