    "Trivia": "- This is the first episode to be produced and aired in 16:9 format. The opening and ending animation however still remain in 4:3 format.\n- This episode mark the introduction of the fourth image for the \"Next episode\" preview., which is an minor update to the third one. Instead of a wooden background, it is a metallic one with the word \"Detective Conan\" all over the background.\n- The primetime movie Starblade and Tohto Cinema are a parody to Stars Wars and Toho Cinemas. Since they are watching movie VI of the series, it would equate in the Star Wars franchise to Revenge of the Sith, although chronologically to the series' timeline it would be Return of the Jedi.\n- New \"Next Conan's hint\" design.\n- The Star Blade characters are named after characters from Gosho Aoyama's other manga Yaiba[1]:\n- Dark Sashim (ダーク・サシム / Dāku Sashimu) is named after Yaiba's mentor and historical swordsman Musashi Miyamoto. The character also looks like Star Wars character Darth Vader, albeit the helmet is a samurai helmet and he holds two swords, just like Musashi's two-sword technique;\n- Dark Takio (ダーク・タキオ / Dāku Takio) is named after Yaiba's nemesis in the final arc Soshi Okita. His dark side and costume come from Star Wars character Darth Sidious;\n- Bey Ju (ベイ・ジュウ / Bei jū) is named after Yaiba's friend and Musashi's former disciple Jubei Yagyu. His face bears resemblances with Star Wars character Darth Maul, as well as Obi-Wan Kenobi;\n- Kisasa (キササ) is named after Kojiro Sasaki, Musashi's resurrected rival, although she is a girl. She corresponds in Star Wars to Padmé Amidala.\n"
