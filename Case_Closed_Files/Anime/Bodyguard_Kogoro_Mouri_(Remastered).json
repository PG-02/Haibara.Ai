    "Situation": "It started when Kogoro is doing a training to become a bodyguard, but he failed. He then asks Arimasa Dobashi, the security guard representative, to give him one more chance.\n\nIn the past, someone was trying to kill the famous actress Ryo Haneki. Haneki decides to hire Kogoro to become a bodyguard, and use his detective skills to determine who's trying to kill her. The filming crew and the other actress, Reina Sawazaki, are on the bus, while Ryo and Kogoro, along with Conan, Ran, and Ryo's manager Kazuya Kusamoto are in the caravan.\nThey arrive at Lake Nakajima where they will be filming the drama. The group are staying at Auberge Muto. They are welcomed by the owner, Shohei Muto and Kimie Muto. Kogoro is going to 'disinfect' the building, but surprisingly Dobashi appears from the building, claimed that he already done 'disinfection'.\nIt is later known that Reina and Ryo has a relationship like cats and dogs despite being in the same agency. Ryo also heard the rumors that the drama will be cancelled.\nSuddenly, they heard Reina shouting. Turns out that Reina is allergic to cats, while there are many stray cats around. Kusumoto only told Kogoro about it, but not Dobashi. That night, they start filming the scenes.\nLater, while the others are sleeping, Conan just finished using the toilet, when he see someone's shadow walks into Ryo's room. The mysterious person is holding a knife, and attemped to stab Ryo.\n\nThe next day, they start filming at Lake Nakajima. Shohei warns the staff that there will be mist coming from the mountains, and the winds will have subtle effect on the waves. Later, Kimie tells Dobashi that there is a call for him.\nThe filming continues at the lake. Suddenly, the mist appears to be so dense that the oars are not working. The staff and Kogoro then lost sight of Ryo and Reina's baot. Later, Dobashi tells Kogoro that Ryo might have realized about the decision that she will be released from her agency, so she is plotting a make up story that the media would love. However it seems that Ryo is convinced that her enemy also realized that too, so she might try to kill Reina.\nConan and Ran decide to ride the boat, but the oars are not working too. Suddenly, they heard a motor running sound on the water. In the end, they wind make all boats end up on a small island in the middle of the lake.\nLater, Kogoro finds Reina lying unconsious on the ground. He later finds Ryo hidding behind a tree, while someone is also hidding behind another tree, holding a gun. Conan asks Kogoro if he knows how the boats get washed up to the island. Kogoro then knows who is the culprit.\n",
