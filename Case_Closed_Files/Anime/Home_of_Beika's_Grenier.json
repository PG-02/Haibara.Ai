Haibara tricks the real estate agent into giving them a tour of the inside and Conan notices that he could see Kogoro's detective agency from the third floor window. The next day, they discover the house has been sold to an old couple and Conan finds them suspicious. He follows the old man to China town and into an antique shop.
