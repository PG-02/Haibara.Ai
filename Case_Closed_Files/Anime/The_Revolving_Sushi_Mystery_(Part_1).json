    "Situation": "Agasa takes the Detective Boys to a revolving sushi shop. While there, Ryuzo Agatsuma, a food critic, collapses by cyanide poisoning.\n\nWhen the police arrive, Conan tells them there are three possible suspects: the manager Danji Namaki; Osamu Aizono, the costumer seated left of Ryuzo; and Sakiko Takemura the woman six seat right of Ryuzo. After the police search through the costumers and sushi, they were unable to find the source of the poison. The police then interrogate the suspects connections to Ryuzo and each reveal they have a motive for the murder.\n",

The scanner on the conveyor belt sensed the plate was old and pushed the plate into the trash. After finding the wet napkin in the trash, Osamu confesses to his crimes and reveals that during a date in a revolving sushi restaurant with his wife Ryuzo had noticed that he was showing off to his wife, by identifying the fish that was used to make the sushi.\n",
