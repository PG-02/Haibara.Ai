    "Situation": "Ryota Beppu goes to Mouri Detective Agency, asking Kogoro to save his girlfriend, Ami Takigawa, who has been kidnapped by \"The Red Sheep\". Starngely, the culprit did not demand a ransom. Ran and Conan feel that they have saw a red sheep in the past.\n\nAround midnight, Ryota goes to Beika Park as The Red Sheep instructed, while Kogoro observes through the bushes. Suddenly, someone appears and run towards Ryota. It is Ami, who supposed to be kidnapped. Later, Ami reveals that it is just a game to test her boyfriend's courage and love, which is popular on social media. Knowing that, Kogoro scolds the couple.\nAt the same time, Conan is wandering around the street, when he is found out by Ran. It seems that both are curious about \"The Red Sheep\". Suddenly, from Beika bridge tunnel, someone in a red sheep coustume appears. However, the red sheep just passes through them. Ran and Conan then go into the tunnel, where they find a dead body.\n\nThe police arrives and investigates the crime scene. Kogoro later also arrives. Conan then mention that the red sheep's horns left a mark on the tunnel ceiling. The dead man is Tetsusaburo Wakabayashi, owner and head cook of a resturant called \"La Mucho\". Kogoro then remembers that both Ryota and Ami works at \"La Mucho\". He later go to find the couple.\nThe next day, Ran, Conan, and the police go to \"La Mucho\". Kokichi Mukai, the assistant head cook, and Daiki Kamio, the cook, confirm that the knife use to kill Wakabayashi is indeed Wakabayashi's own knife. Later, the restaurant co-owner, Motojiro Hirasawa, arrives. All the three live alone and do not have an alibi. When Conan mention about the red sheep, Kamio seems distrubed. He reveals that people have been talking about the red sheep on a video sharing site recently. There are videos uploaded where the red sheep has been scaring couples on dates and then running off. Later, Conan notices a strange mark in the kitchen.\nKogoro then arrives at the restaurant along with Ryota and Ami. Kogoro suspects that Ryota and Ami might be involved somehow. However, Wakabayashi hardly left the kitchen and never talks to Ryota and Ami, who are floor staff, so they should have nothing to do with the murder. Conan then wonders if Wakabayashi receive a threatening message, but Hirasawa says that Wakabayashi didn't have girlfriend. Suddenly, Takagi recieves a call that there is a threatening message sent to Wakabayashi's computer around 10:00 pm.\n\nThe threatening messages is a video, where the red sheep says that they have kidnapped Anri and demanded 50 million yen as the ransom. It is believed that Anri is Wakabayshi's girlfriend, who he recently met through a dating app recomended by Kamio.\nLater, Conan asks Kamio to let them see the popular red sheep video. Ran then also take a closer look at the video. Suddenly, both Ran and Conan remember that they have meet the red sheep ten years ago at a festival. Conan then go to Beika Costume Rental Storeroom, where he found the red sheep costume. It is the same costume used as there is a mark left on the horns after it scraped the ceiling. Unfortunately, he was mistaken as a thief by the owner of the renatl store, Hideto Iwami. Luckily, Kogoro and Ran arrive at the store.\nIwami reveals that recently, the red sheep costume has been stolen during the night and was returned every morning. The last time the costume was rented is three weeks ago, around the time when the red sheep video was uploaded. The person who rented the costume reveals to be Motojiro Hirasawa.\nThe next day, all people gathers at \"La Mucho\", where Kogoro reveals his deduction.\n",
    "People": "- 24 years old\n- \"La Mucho\" restaurant employee\n- Victim (kidnapped)\n- 20 years old\n- \"La Mucho\" restaurant employee\n- Ryota's girlfriend\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- 45 years old\n- \"La Mucho\" restaurant owner and head cook\n- 45 years old\n- \"La Mucho\" restaurant assistant head cook\n- 25 years old\n- \"La Mucho\" restaurant cook\n- 40 years old\n- \"La Mucho\" restaurant co-owner\n- 50 years old\n- Beika Costume Rental Company president\n- Victim (kidnapped)\n- Tetsusaburo's girlfriend?\n",
    "Resolution": "Suspicion then falls to Ryota and Ami. On that day, Hirasawa asked them to hold onto the cardboard box the costume was stored in. Conan deduces that they could have known the contents of the box through the shipping slip. Kogoro then mentions the unlocked storeroom door, but Ryota says that there is no way that they could've known that the storeroom's lock was broken, which means they literally knew about the broken lock. Later, it is revealed that \"The Red Sheep\" that has been scaring couples is Ami Takigawa, while Ryota Beppu recorded and uploaded the videos. The motive is that Ami heard about Hirasawa’s plan to make the staff wear the costume for the restaurant's fifth anniversary, so they made the video to ruin the sheep's image. However, Ami refuses to tell who told her about the plan, while Hirasawa only told Wakabayashi about it.\nLater, Kogoro is sure that they are also the ones who kidnapped Anri. Conan then tranquilizes Kogoro and starts the Sleeping Kogoro deduction show. It is true that Ami Takigawa was involved in the kidnapping, but she disguised herself as Anri, and pretended to be Wakabayashi's girlfriend, since Wakabaysahi didn't know the floor staff faces and names. Meanwhile, \"The Red Sheep\" who pretended to kidnap her is Daiki Kamio. The pieces of evidence are:\n- Both Ami and Kamio called Wakabayashi \"Chef\", which is Wakabayashi's nickname on the dating app.\n- After wearing the head of the red sheep costume, Kamio's hair was flattened in the same way as the day before. He admits that his hair was flattened yesterday because he was riding his bike. However, yesterday he told Hirasawa that he hasn't ridden his bike since the accident.\n- Some red nylon fibers from the costume ended up stuck on his watch. Conan had instructed him to not move his hands when he made Kamio wear the red sheep head, which means he had touched the costume before today.\nConan through Kogoro deduces that Kamio probably has bugged the kitchen and thats how he knew about the hidden 50 million yen. Ami then reveals that she just used Ryota as an alibi, while she was already in a relationship with Kamio for a long time. However, Kamio admits that their plan was only to take the money, not to kill Wakabayashi. In fact, after Ami went to Beika Park, he put the costume in the car and took a break, when suddenly someone hit him on the back of his head and stole the red sheep costume.\nLater, someone is looking for something inside a penguin costume at the Beika Costume Rental Storeroom. Suddenly, the red sheep appears and surprises the mysterious person. The person falls down onto the floor while hitting the penguin costume, revealing the money hidden inside. The red sheep reveals to be Kogoro, while the mysterious person is Hideto Iwami, who is also the culprit that murdered Wakabayashi. Conan noticed that when yesterday he hit his head on the costume. The costume was hanging lower than the other costumes because it was being weighed down by the 50 million yen inside it.\nIwami then confesses and explains what happened. He was trying to catch the culprit who had been stealing the red sheep costume at midnight. That night, he saw Ami and Kamio steal the costume and overheard their plan to steal 50 million yen from Wakabayashi. He was mad that they used the costume to steal money like it was a game while his company is about to go bankrupt, so he followed them and took the chance to take back the costume. Iwami then continued the plan to get the money by posing as the kidnapper. The plan went well as Wakabayashi obediently placed the bag containing the money on the ground. However, when Iwami opened the bag, he found Wakabayashi's knife inside along with the money which he had brought along for protection. Iwami was surprised and stood up quickly, hit the ceiling with the horns, which caused the red sheep head to fall off. Realizing that his face was revealed along with the fear of being identified, he in a moment of panic and fear stabbed and killed Wakabayashi. He swears to them in tears that he did not mean for that to happen, he did not intend to kill him.\n",
