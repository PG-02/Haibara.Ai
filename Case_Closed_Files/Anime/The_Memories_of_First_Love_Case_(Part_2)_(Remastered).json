    "Situation": "Conan, Ran, and Sonoko are cleaning up Shinichi's house, and their chat goes from Sonoko complaining about doing this in summer break to Ran wondering who could have been Shinichi's first love and Sonoko speculating whether Ran was his first love or not. Almost as if on cue, an old classmate stops by to check on Shinichi's well-being, then joins the group in their cleaning: her name is Asami Uchida, she used to be the student council president of Teitan Middle School when Ran Sonoko and Shinichi were in the Grade 7 and she now attends a local art-centered university as a literature major.\nWhile helping Conan and the girls with their work, Asami mentions that she'll throw her birthday party in a nearby bungalow that she and her friends rented specially for the event. She had come to personally invite Shinichi, however, and drops hints about a love confession that he might have given her four years ago. Sonoko mentions rumors about a younger student stalking Asami in these days, and Ran concludes that Asami was Shinichi's first love. Sonoko manages to rope Asami into inviting them as well, and Kogoro agrees to go there, once he learns one of the people has been a three time beauty contest winner.\nThe party starts normally, with the additional perk that it's also a celebration for Asami winning a literary prize, a tennis tournament and a beauty contest, and everyone seems to have quite a good time. A pretty girl named Tomoko Hayasaka teases the handsome Manabu Sawai about being a playboy, but he ignores it and focuses on complimenting Kogoro for having a way with words. Around the same time the older students Yoshinobu Morimoto, Chika Miyazaki and Shigehisa Noguchi mention Asami's accomplishments: she defeated Morimoto in the literary contest, Chika was just a runner-up for the beauty one that she won, and she was a part of the couple that won a mixed tennis tournament that Noguchi participated in as well.\nIn the meantime, Ran and Asami are baking Asami's trademark recipe: lemon pie. Asami forgot to bring the one she already baked. The pie itself looks messy since Ran had never baked any pies, but it actually tastes good; Asami says what matters is what's on the inside, rather than how it looks.\nThe party goes on well, and the bungalow's fax machine gets a fax from one of Asami's professors, wishing her a happy birthday. Asami herself, however, is feeling like crap all of a sudden so she's taking a nap. Sawai and mentions a nearby karaoke parlor where they already booked a room, saying they should let Asami sleep and go there for a while.\nAs everyone has fun, Sonoko notices Ran is rather mopey instead. She mentions how Asami is sweet, gorgeous, smart, once was the manager of the school's soccer club that Shinichi was a member of, and looks like she's super perfect, so she guesses that Shinichi admires Asami quite a bit and correctly deduced that Ran is feeling inferior to her. Ran mentions that Asami said Shinichi likes lemon pie a lot and offered to teach her (Ran) the recipe, and confirms that she feels like she can't compare to Asami. Sonoko tries to cheer her up by saying Asami is herself and so is Ran, so she shouldn't bring herself down.\nAround 3 AM, the group starts getting ready to return to the rented bungalow nevermind one or two problems: like Noguchi being drunk, Sawai taking too much time to bring cigarettes or Kogoro being for too long in the restroom. They decide to go back and then go to bed so they can clean up in the morning, but then they look through the window and the bungalow is on fire. Kogoro and Sawai immediately look for the keys to the rental car they have handy, so they can go there and rescue her.\nWhen the group arrives, the bungalow's completely surrounded by fire, so much that it almost pours from the windows and even the doors. Ran, who was praying for Asami's safety in their way there, sees Chika trying to move a nearby motorcycle and has an idea: she puts on the moto's driving helmet, goes inside followed by Conan, kicks the door to the nearby open and rescues Asami.\n\nRan passes out almost immediately after rescuing Asami, both from the smoke inhalation and the huge effort. She wakes up in the nearby hospital and is fine, but Asami is still unconscious. She tells Sonoko that the helmet idea came from Conan, who gave it to her so she'd have extra protection, and mentions that he did something incredible.\nConan, Kogoro and the birthday guests are back to what remains of the bungalow and gather information. The fire began at 2:50 AM, at the living room, and was apparently caused by the b-day people's carelessness: Asami's birthday cake was left with its candles burning, they fell on the floor and the gift-wrapping papers, which triggered the fire itself and spreads it all around. Kogoro doesn't really believe this, and he wonders if Asami herself set the fire.\nAt the hospital, Sonoko tells Ran that when she was brought to the hospital, Asami was calling out to Shinichi and apologizing to him in whispers. They decide to go get some drinks and take a break, unaware of how Asami awakens once they leave.\nConan hears what Kogoro says and is troubled by several details. He's sure that Asami was lying on the couch when they left, but she was on the floor when he and Ran found her; additionally, several furniture pieces were in different spots. He wonders if Morimoto, who had the key to the house, set the place on fire, but decides against it since the fire began at 2:50 AM so he couldn't have had enough time and the window was open so the key wasn't needed. He also wonders about Noguchi (he had the car keys) and Chika (who has a bike), since there was some time when everyone was out of the karaoke parlor, but decides against it too: he couldn't have enough time, and her bike was already parked.  Also, the policemen haven't found any specific things that could have been used to set the fire from a distance.\nConan wonders if Asami did truly set the fire, whether to kill herself or get attention. One of the firemen tells Conan not to stay too close to the burned remains and hands him two sheets of paper, apparently coming from the fax machine. Then Conan checks on the sheets and realizes that they were from two different faxes. The firemen also tell Conan that the cake was placed right under the fax machine.\nRan and Sonoko are still in the hospital, commenting how Asami switched from the tennis to the soccer club despite her natural tennis talent. Then they find out that Asami has disappeared. Around the same time, Conan snoops around the nearby store and finds out that Tomoko, Sawai and the already drunk Noguchi were around, and one of them may have something to do with the incident. It is here where the gas station manager tells Conan that Sawai had attempted to put a piece of sticky paper into the fax machine and then \"send it backwards\". After realizing that Asami had disappeared, Ran and Sonoko call Mouri. With everyone gathered around, Conan tranquilizes Mouri and begins his deduction.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (burned-injured)\n- 18 years old\n- Freshman, Literature Department Tohto University\n- 22 years old\n- Senior, Tohto University, Literature Dept.\n- Mystery club president\n- 21 years old\n- Senior, Tohto University, Literature Dept.\n- Mystery club vice-president\n- 20 years old\n- Sophomore, Tohto University, Literature Dept.\n- 19 years old\n- Sophomore, Tohto University, Literature Dept.\n- 22 years old\n- Junior, Tohto University, Literature Dept.\n- Fireman\n- Fireman\n- Fireman\n- Debris cleaning staff\n- Fireman\n- Debris cleaning staff\n- Sunday Mart convenience store manager\n- Tohto University, Literature Dept. professor\n- Asami's supervisor\n",
    "Resolution": "",
    "Evidence": "Manabu Sawai is the culprit. He set up the birthday cake with lit candles on a chair below the fax machine and sent a fax from a convenience store while pretending to use the phone, so the received fax caught fire as soon as the paper sheets touched the still-lit candles. To make sure this would happen, he sent several faxes and tested this method to be sure it would work.  It's demonstrated when Conan through Kogoro tells the firemen to set up a similar trick in what remains of the house, effectively showing how easy it was for Sawai to set everything on fire without being there.\n- He adds that when everyone was getting ready to leave to the karaoke box, Sawai took the \"time out\" to rearrange the furniture and place the sleeping Asami, whom he surely drugged with pills, on the floor so she wouldn't get burned.\n- The owner of the shop saw Sawai using the fax machine when everyone else was singing in the parlor; then Conan appears holding two pieces of burned paper and showing them as proof as they do not match each other meaning they came from two different pieces of paper. The confirmation paper coming from the fax machine also holds info about Sawai's presence, like his phone name and fingerprints. Also Sawai had problems handling the fax machine itself so he had to use the birthday fax from Asami's professor as a test and the shop owner recalled his odd behavior.\nSawai angrily retorts all of this and asks for real proof.\n- When the group arrived and they suggested to call Asami to see if she was okay, Sawai openly said the phone itself would be gone.\n- The prof's fax, still smeared with cream, which Sawai probably kept in his pocket.\n",
    "Conclusion": "Manabu Sawai is the culprit. Chika and Noguchi openly wonder why Sawai would have wanted to kill Asami, but Conan through Kogoro says he never wanted to kill her and adds he wanted to save her, to be her \"knight in shining armor\" who would win her affections after rescuing her from mortal danger.\n",
    "Motive": "One of the firemen approaches Sawai and he tells him to stop, then pulls out the the fax paper and admits what he did, saying that he never expected the fire to spread as fast as he did. His motive was, effectively, to save Asami's life and thus catch her attention and gratitude, after having been rejected by her the previous month. Up until then, no girl had ever refused the handsome and charming Sawai's affections, so he was shell-shocked and wanted her to love him. However, Conan through Kogoro angrily calls Sawai out, stating that Asami would've died had they not made it back to the villa in time due to a potential traffic jam, car breakdown, or flat tire. He further states that if Sawai really wanted Asami to love him, then he should do something honorable and worth her affection rather than putting her in mortal danger and potentially killing her.\nAsami appears on the doorstep right as Sawai surrenders peacefully. Sawai tells her she's such a beautiful and perfect girl, that she can have any man at her feet. She, however, replies that things don't work that way: if someone's heart won't open to someone else, then there's no way to force them to do so.\n",
    "Aftermath": "Later, a more cheerful Asami reveals to Ran and Sonoko that she was bluffing when she said she was Shinichi's first love. In reality he was her first love: she wasn't immediately attracted to him from the start, but came to like him for his talent and for his blunt approach to things - she once baked a terrible lemon pie for her tennis and soccer club friends, and he was the only person who told her it wasn't tasty, so she baked and baked until she made one he actually liked. She adds that she taught Ran a bad lemon pie recipe on a whim, but Ran was still skilled enough at baking to make it edible, and that she wanted to invite Shinichi to the party to get back at him for all the times he told her the pie sucked.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the anime, when Sawai admits that he didn't think the fire would expand as quick as it did, Conan gets so angry that through Kogoro, he calls him on how selfish he has been: had the group been late for less than two minutes, Asami would have burned or asphyxiated to death, and Sawai never thought of it since he was that wrapped in his own feelings. He adds that if Sawai actually wanted to be loved by Asami, he should've simply stuck to become an honorable guy that she would've admired and come to love.\n- In the anime, the professor who sent the fax to Asami was named Masao Takamura, whereas in the manga, the professor was called Hideo Takamura.\n",

    "Remastered version": "- A remastered version of this case was aired August 20, 2016 and August 27, 2016.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Nazo can be heard playing in a jukebox.\n- Although Conan may not want to take part in cleaning his own house, he said that \"if it is not cleaned, it'll turn into a haunted house\", making a reference to A Haunted Mansion Murder Case, when the Detective Boys said that the Kudo House was a haunted house.\n- Asami Uchida claims to always get Shinichi's answering machine when she calls, although in The Time-Bombed Skyscraper all Kudo House calls would be rerouted to Agasa's house.\n- Asami Uchida may not have known at first, but she deduced from this case that Ran must be the one that Shinichi has been in love with since he was little, just based on his vague description of her, however Ran still has no idea that he was describing her.\n- Shigehisa's (茂久) name is wrongly written as Shibahisa (芝久) in his introductory suspects' box.\n- Chika Miyazaki's motorbike is a 1998 Honda Global.\n",
