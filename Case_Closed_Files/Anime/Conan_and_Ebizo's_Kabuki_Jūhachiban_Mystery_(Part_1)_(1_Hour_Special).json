    "Situation": "Conan, Genta, and Mitsuhiko were playing soccer while Haibara and Ayumi were sitting at a bench, watching them run around. At one point, the ball hit Mitsuhiko in face as he was trying to volley a pass from Conan and it flew towards the fences. As Conan went to pick up the ball, a car passed by, making its way down a hill. He and Haibara noticed there were drops of brake fluid on the road and immediately realized that car was out of control. She tells him there is a railroad crossing up ahead and tosses his skateboard to him. As Conan skateboards down the hill to stop the car, she calls the police. At the crossing, Sonoko was in a car using her phone when she heard that car honking. She turns around and sees Conan airborne with his skateboard, catching her by surprise. He manages to stop the car by wrapping his belt around a railing and shooting a soccer ball, which inflated and redirected the car toward a pile of cardboard boxes at Tohto Paper Recycling Plant.\n\nThe police arrive at the plant and tell Takuya Hosoo, that car's driver, that someone messed with its brakes. Takuya tells them he knew that, but he had no choice since having to hurry. He even says who does not have time to take any questioning from them. Soon after, Kogoro and Ran arrive at the scene to scold Conan, not knowing that the kid saved Takuya, and Sonoko came soon after. They misunderstood Conan's intentions because Sonoko told them the kid caused the car to crash, since she saw it right after Conan flew onto the road.\nAs Takuya was opening the trunk of his car to look at a briefcase, which he had to deliver to someone, he turned his head and recognized Sonoko as President Suzuki's daughter. It turns out they meet each other often during Kabuki after-parties, since her father is a huge fan. Ran and Conan bugged out when Sonoko told them she dined with the famous Kabuki theater actor Ichikawa Ebizo XI a bunch of times. Takuya tells them Ebizo is a big fan of Sleeping Kogoro, who is famous as the best detective in Japan.\nTakuya, Kogoro, Ran, Sonoko, and Conan are on Hitoshi Takahashi's car, heading toward Kabuki theater where Ebizo is currently. He is aware that Conan was actually a detective since Kaitou Kid's midair walk, and kept calling him \"Detective\". On the way there, Takuya and Hitoshi discuss the incident from earlier. Hitoshi tells Takuya that he did not see anyone suspicious near the garage of his luxury house last night. At the theater, they see Ebizo and some other people practicing \"Nanatsu Men\" of the Jūhachiban Kabuki. After some practice, everyone gathers around to see Ebizo open the briefcase Takuya gave to him. Inside, there was a two-faced mask, made by someone from the wood leftover used to restore the Buddha at Todaiji Temple during the Kamakura Period. As everyone gazes at it in awe, Conan notices something peculiar about it.\nThe next morning, when the president was shocked about the two-faced mask is gone, it was found on Hitoshi's car, who is dead, but the stolen mask is gone and only the briefcase is there. According to Tome, the culprit used vinyl gloves to complete the crime.\n\n\nIn his car, Ebizo thinks that Conan was actually solving the cases while hiding behind Kogoro. They gone in Hoaji Hospital, where Iwami almost commits suicide, but the nurse Harumi Sakaguchi stops him.\n\nWhile Conan is talking to Kaneko, he was kidnapped and left in an abandoned building being demolished. He manages to make his way through the rubble, but the door is locked and no one can hear his screams. Ran, Sonoko, Haibara, and the Detective Boys are wondering where's Conan and go looking for him around Ginza 4-chome, Iwaibashi. Ebizo also joins them.\n\nThey found Conan in the basement and Ebizo saved him just in time. However, the main suspect is found dead under the rubble. The stolen mask is also found in the camera case next to Kaneko's body.\n\nExamining Kaneko's chip, Conan and Haibara found the evidence just in time. Meanwhile, Kogoro claims to know who the culprit is, but Conan proves Ebizo's innocence the next afternoon, using Sleeping Kogoro on the main stage of theater.\n",
