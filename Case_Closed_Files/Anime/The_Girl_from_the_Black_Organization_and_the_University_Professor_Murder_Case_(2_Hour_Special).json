    "Case 1: Missing Older Brother Case": "",
    "Situation": "Haibara explains her story about the drug, her sister's death and her escape. She reveals that she accidentally sent a floppy disk containing data on the Black Organization to her older sister... which is now in the possession of her sister's professor, Masami Hirota. They track down Hirota through the university and Agasa posed as a friend of Haibara's sister Akemi Miyano, and Hirota agrees to give them the disk, but first after he has some other visitors.\nAgasa takes Conan and Haibara to Hirota's home so they can get the disk, only to realize that Hirota has been murdered. Discovering the voice messages, they discovered the suspects are Hirota's three students who visited that day and the Black Organization. However, they quickly rule out the Black Organization involvement because the crime was too messy to be Black Organization's style.\n\n",
    "People": "- Victim (bludgeoned)\n- 61 years old\n- Nanyo University professor\n- 53 years old\n- Masami Hirota's wife\n- 25 years old\n- Model\n- 48 years old\n- Veterinarian\n- 43 years old\n- Trading company manager\n- Black Organization member investigating Shinichi's death\n- Black Organization member investigating Shinichi's death\n- Black Organization member\n- Spied on Akemi\n- Black Organization member\n- Spied on Akemi\n- Masami's friend\n- Masami's friend\n- Shizuoka Prefecture police officer\n- Yokomizo's subordinate\n- Shizuoka Prefecture police officer\n- Yokomizo's subordinate\n- Shizuoka Prefecture police officer\n- Yokomizo's subordinate\n- Shizuoka Prefecture forensics officer\n- Yokomizo's subordinate\n",
    "Resolution": "Conan reveals the culprit to be Akira Shirakura; Shirakura after bludgeoning Hirota to death tied the answering machine cassette tape around the key to the room which rewound when a call was made and subsequently bringing the key into the room. The cassette tape was also wrapped around some pawn chess pieces that were placed upside with a notebook on top. Once that was done, he simply called the phone and as the cassette tape was being rewound it knocked the chess pieces causing the notebook to fall on top of the key at the same time. As evidence, Conan reveals that Shirakura's fingerprints should be found on the tape.\nShirakura says that he killed Hirota because he possessed some very embarrassing and compromising photos of himself, which could ruin his career as a model. Additionally, Hirota had mocked him on the phone when he begged him to give him the photos which made his temper flare. Upon hearing Shirakura's motives, Agasa counters saying that he misunderstood Hirota's words - he actually wanted Shirakura to let go of his pride, only that he did so in the wrong way. Shirakura then gives himself up to the police.\nOnce Shirakura is taken away, Haibara breaks down in tears. She explains the rest of her story, revealing that her sister was Akemi Miyano alias the same ex-Black Organization member who died in Conan's arms. Then she asks Conan why, if he's so good with his deductions, why he couldn’t he have saved her sister, and ends up crying further while holding on a shocked Conan's shirt.\nLater that day, Haibara attempts to read the files off the disk only to have a virus delete all the data.\n",
    "Case 2: Murdered Professor Case": "",
    "Episode resolution": "- Sherry, real name Shiho Miyano, betrayed the Black Organization after they refused to justify the circumstances of her sister's death. Shiho was set to be killed for insubordination, so Shiho took the drug she made to commit suicide. It instead de-aged her without the Black Organization's knowing, and she managed to escape. Because of this, Shiho realized that Shinichi Kudo likely shrank so she went to his house where she ran into Agasa.\n- Shiho moves in with Agasa, takes the alias Ai Haibara, and transfers to Teitan Elementary.\n- Conan discovers that the woman from the billion yen bank robbery, Akemi Miyano, is Shiho's sister. Viewers also learn that the scientist sister of Akemi's that Gin said was too valuable to leave the Organization was Shiho.[1]\n- Conan discovers the name of the drug that shrunk him is APTX 4869, and its creator is Sherry.\n- Conan discovers the Black Organization searched Shinichi's house twice to make sure he was dead.\n- The disk of APTX 4869 data which also contained real names and funding sources or involved agents is erased by the Night Baron virus that had been planted on the disk.\n- The Black Organization calls off plans to kill Masami Hirota because he was murdered by someone else first.\n- Various members of the Black Organization, including Gin, start hunting for Sherry.\n",
