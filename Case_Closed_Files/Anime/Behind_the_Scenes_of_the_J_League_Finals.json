    "Situation": "The \"J League 30th Anniversary Match\" is currently hitting the National Stadium with Kawasaki Frontale versus FC Tokyo. The Detective Boys were fairly lucky and got chosen by lottery, to participate a special event, have a good time out there by having a mixed special friendly match with players from both teams. They get along pretty well, Ayumi kicks out firstly, and passes the ball to Genta, following by Mitsuhiko, who kicks the ball in the air as he gets it. Then Conan, who gets lifted by two strikers, which heads the goal. Lastly, Kento Tachibanada, a player from the Kawasaki Frontale team, shoots the ball into the goal. Detective Boys gets extremely satisfied, Mitsuhiko then asks Kento what his secret to success is, he answers steadily: \"First, relax and calm down.\" \"And, keep a broad field of view. Look at not the pitch, but the entire stadium.\" Kuryu Matsuki added. Conan sighs and thinks people who compete internationally are on another level. At the same time, within the Metropolitan Police Department, Megure seems to be well-dressed for something. However, when his colleague asks him, he conceals his intent, and utters that it is only some minor business.\nThe actual match finally begins, all Detective Boys members have retired to the auditorium. Amidst the laughter, there is one person who is in a bad mood, she is Haibara. Originally, she was planning to hold hands with her favorite soccer player from the Big Osaka team, Ryusuke Higo. Unluckily, she got the date of the game wrong. Apparently, the Big Osaka match was yesterday. Genta then proposes that another player from the Big Osaka, Takahiro Sanada, did tons of mistakes for the previous game. Haibara nodded, and said that Sanada missed a huge opportunity, hence Big Osaka lost the game badly.\nAs their remarks concerning Sanada proceeds, a voice from the back interrupts everyone. The person is precisely Sanada. While they watch the game together, Haibara perceives something strange in the stands behind the goal of the Kawasaki Frontale, which should have been occupied by fanatical fans, is empty. Haibara then finds the livestream on social media that displays the condition of the outside of the stadium, it is right now exceedingly chaotic. Somehow, the tickets that the fans had worked so hard becomes invalid. On the big display, Conan realises that there is one person that looks odd. He constantly looks at his watch and seems not interested at the game at all. Conan quickly calls Takagi for searching some information about him. After some time, Conan receives the information. Evidently, he is called Yuzo Fukunaga. Was a former terrorist and was the mastermind behind a large-scale terrorist plot. He was then arrested and was just released a few days ago. Takagi and Sato decide to head towards the National Stadium after being informed by Conan that something is not right there.\nEven though the match is fanatically in progress, Sanada and Conan no longer have interest on it anymore. They decide to investigate this case. When they arrive at the front gate, they see millions of insane football fans quarreling with regards to the invalid ticket. Notwithstanding that, the meticulous Conan identifies some people that is not so desperate to get inside, but was somewhat monitoring the scenes, and he deduces they might be Yuzo's accomplices. Just now, Haibara bombards Conan with a shocking news... Yuzo's accomplice handed him a long-shaped case, which looks like a sniper rifle! What is his target? What will him do?\n\n",
