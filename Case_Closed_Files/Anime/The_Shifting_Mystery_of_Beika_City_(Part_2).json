    "People": "- Victim (stabbed)\n- 24 years old\n- Unemployed\n- 33 years old\n- Office worker\n- Victim (poison)\n- 35 years old\n- Neighborhood association president\n- 20 years old\n- College student\n- 68 years old\n- Cafe manager\n- 23 years old\n- Waitress\n- 35 years old\n- College professor\n- 55 years old\n- Hikoichi's housekeeper\n- 32 years old\n- Editor\n- Hiro's lover\n- \"The Melting Weapon\" book author\n",
    "Resolution": "Conan's clue for discovering Kanemitsu's guilt were the mystery books she had brought to her café and removed after the murders; all of them featured short stories she had already successfully published, and Agatha Christie's The ABC Murders, on which the case was incidentally patterned based on the victims' last names and Kanemitsu's pen name. Kanemitsu, admitting her guilt, subtly left those clues so that only a true mystery fan, who would be Conan, would be able to expose her as the culprit.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The Haido University appeared in a painting from The Man Who Died Twice.\n- The name \"Dorosue\" is a reference to mystery author Dorothy L. Sayers.\n- The name of Kanemitsu's cafe is \"Brown\", which is a reference to G.K. Chesterton's detective priest, Father Brown.\n- The motorbike is a Honda CB 400 Super Four.\n- This episode pays homage to Agatha Christie's novel ABC Murders and also novel The Tragedy of X written by Manfred Lee and Frederic Dannay.\n- The names of the characters follow the same pattern as in the ABC Murders, where the characters' last names are following an alphabetical order, except for the culprit's name (Toyoko Kanemitsu):\n- A: Tatsuya Amagi;\n- B: Hikoichi Bando;\n- C: Yosuke Chino;\n- D: Dorosue Yamiyo (the name is written in the Japanese order, henceforth, Dorosue is the last name);\n- E: Hiro Ezaki;\n- F: Tameo Fukuda;\n- G: Koyuki Gamo;\n- H: Eiko Hayama;\n- I: Zetto Ichimura.\n"
