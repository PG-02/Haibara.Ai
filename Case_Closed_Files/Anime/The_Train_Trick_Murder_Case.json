    "Situation": "As Kogoro, Ran, and Conan are on their way home from a hot spring in Komono, Mie Prefecture, they boarded a train together with a pair of doctors. They arrived at a station where one may change trains to another line, but no one could possibly change trains since the two lines are scheduled differently by a mere five-minute difference. At the station where the trio are to change trains to one going to Tokyo, a murder is discovered. The only suspect rides in the train with Conan's group while the victim rides on a train from a different line.\n\n",
    "People": "- Doctor\n- Doctor\n- Victim (poison)\n- Doctor\n- Hananomachi railway police chief\n- Mizunokawa Line stewardess\n- Mizunokawa Line kiosk clerk\n- Mizunokawa Line rich passenger\n- Pharmaceutical company director\n",
    "Resolution": "He used a series of tricks to kill the victim and maintain a alibi. When the train stopped at Mizunokawa Station, he got off and disguised himself by putting on a mustache and hat as well as turning his reversible jacket inside out. Then he got on the train where Utsumi was. He was able to delay the train via phone call claiming to be a passenger who forgot his belongings on the train. He then sat down across from Utsumi and after talking he ambushed and injected him with a syringe full of medicine that induced a heart attack.\nHe robbed the victim including a substantial amount of coins to give the impression of an indiscriminate robbery. However this itself was strange as there was a better target: a rich woman who was wearing expensive jewelry and most likely had a large amount of money as well.\nThe possibility of fingerprints on the money was brought up, but Date claimed that Utsumi had lent him money so finding his fingerprints wouldn't mean anything. However Conan as Kogoro says that was not what he meant when he mentioned fingerprints. He meant that the coins had fingerprints from the Stewardess. Utsumi had bought a drink from the stewardess with a 10,000 yen bill, however she did not have 1,000 yen bills so she gave him his change in coins.\n",
