    "Situation": "One night, Conan, Haibara, and the Detective Boys are on fire safety patrol. Conan and Haibara discuss about the two arson cases that happened four and two days ago.\n\n\nOut of nowhere, everyone on patrol sees a man run toward the direction of a fire. They arrive at a park to see a jungle gym in flames and suspect that man is the arsonist. Genta tells everyone he knows that man.\n\nThe next day, the five children hide at an alley near a bento shop, waiting for that man, who, according to Genta, always buys an extra large seaweed lunch at that same shop, where he orders his eel lunches. Conan and Haibara are bothered by the fact that these three arson cases occurred at the same locations - at playgrounds - as the arson cases from last year. The ones from last year lasted for two weeks. The fourth arson case last year resulted in the death of a drunk office worker, who was sleeping while wrapped up in a construction tarp. After that, the cases stopped occurring until recently.\n\nThe man from yesterday arrives at the bento shop to order his usual seaweed lunch, and as he heads back home, the kids secretly follow him. They sit out on the streets, spying the man in his apartment for the whole day. At night, the man walks out of his house, and they quietly follow him again; unfortunately, they lost him because a train passed by and stopped them. Conan and Haibara decide to head the park where the fourth arson case from last year took place, since the next arson will most likely take place there, and the Detective Boys follow. At the park, they see a sheet draped over the slides on fire. Meanwhile, an unknown person runs past the park.\n\nThe sheet is blown up into the air and is about to hit the Detective Boys when suddenly the man they spied on before tackles them, allowing them to barely avoid it. Because of this, the man lost sight of that person who just ran past the playground again, just like yesterday. For some reason, he seems to be paying attention to all of these recent arson cases. After some police investigation and questioning from Detective Takagi, everyone heads home.\nThe next day, the man heads out from his home, hoping to not see the kids again; unfortunately, they were waiting just outside. They all head to Sumire Park, the site of the first arson case, to investigate the chain of arson cases. This year, a side of a seesaw was burned. On a Beika Real Estate commercial sign, the kanji 戸 is circled in red.\n\nAnd next the swing was burned on Sumire Park.\n\nNext, they head to Tsutsuji Park, the location of the second arson case. This year, an arched bridge was burned. On a sign post of a ramen restaurant, the character へ is circled in red as well.\n\nNext is the monkey bars in Tsutsuji Park.\n\nThen, they arrive at Himawari Park, the place where the third arson case took place. Last year, a playground horse was burned. On a caution sign for pedestrians, the kanji 歩 is circled in red, too.\n\nAfter some investigation in the park, the man takes them to an eel restaurant. As the Detective Boys enjoy their eel rice, the man tells them he will order some eel liver soup. However, Conan sees the order menu and a 10000 yen bill and realizes he lied and already left the restaurant. He runs outside, but the man is nowhere to be seen; the man baited the kids here so that he can split off with them. He heads to a factory that is closed today.\nMeanwhile, Conan reads the news articles regarding the arson cases again and then immediately leads Haibara and the Detective Boys to the park where the fourth arson case took place. Conan and Haibara head to top of the apartment building near the park and see the character ニ circled in red on a sign labeled \"Ninja Fortress\". After seeing this, Conan figures out what is going on.\nConan saw the culprit holding a torch, and the building was full of oil. When he/she was supposed to throw the torch, Conan hit the torch and the abandoned bulding is safe.\n\nIs the culprit Suguru Kamaishi or Harue Yatabe? Who's the culprit of this arson case?\n",
    "People": "- 25 years old\n- Job-hopper\n- One person \"detective\"\n- 48 years old\n- Part-time employee\n- Bento Shop clerk\n- Fireman\n- Security patrol volunteer\n- Fireman\n- Security patrol volunteer\n",
    "Resolution": "At the front gate, Conan sees a van with a logo of that bento shop Genta goes to buy his eel lunch. They look into a window of the factory and suddenly see a person holding a lit-up torch. Conan leaps over the gate and charges into the factory, where he sees oil spilled all over the place. The arsonist tries to throw the torch at the oil, but Conan, with his soccer ball, knocks the torch out the window and reveals to everyone that the culprit is Harue Yatabe. She is the only one who could have driven that van to the factory.\nThe man also figured out that she was the arsonist. When he bought seaweed lunch a few days ago, he grabbed the change from her hand, and on his way home, he smelled his hand and detected kerosene, leading him to guess she is the culprit. Today, he went to the factory and saw her inside the van with the shop's logo, confirming his hunch. As she walked into the factory carrying two oil tanks, he sneaked in, but she used a pipe to knock him unconscious. Afterwards, he was tied up and gagged until the kids arrived.\nOne and a half year ago, a child was badly injured at a playground because of a defect in a equipment made in this factory. Iroha Toys blamed it all on her, when she was the factory manager at the time, fired her, and pretended to know nothing about it. She set up the countdown to get revenge on the company and make them regret what they did to her.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The hot dog van is a Volkswagen Bus [Typ 2 / T2].\n- Irohanihoheto is the first line of a Japanese poem Iroha. It is famous because it is a perfect pangram, containing each character of the Japanese syllabary exactly once. Because of this, it is also used as an ordering for the syllabary, in the same way as the A, B, C, D... sequence of the Latin alphabet.\n"
