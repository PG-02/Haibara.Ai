    "Situation": "The Detective Boys are exploring an abandoned building when they find a woman crushed by ruins. Suddenly, the woman then wakes up scaring the Detective Boys and fainting the. Soon Conan wakes them up.\nWhen they follow the blood trail that is left by the woman, they arrive to Western Confections Paradise, a confectionery shop. They found a woman with red  clothes with a blood stain in her leg and they suspected her to be the woman who was crushed. They decide to follow her. The woman walks to Western Confections Paradise main factory.\nAs Conan and the Detective Boys plan to enter throughservice entrance, suddenly the secretary of the confectionery company Yayoi Ito screamed. The president of the company, Akira Ogawa, is found drowned in red bean paste.\n\nThe younger brother of the victim and also vice-president of the company Hiroshi Ogawa arrives and tells the secretary to call the police. Hiroshi finds his wife Hanako Ogawa's handkerchief next to the body. He later calls Hanako to make an alibi.\nThe police, along with Kogoro are unable to find out the culprit.However, Conan manages to solve the case first.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (suffocated)\n- 35 years old\n- Western Confections Paradise company president\n- 29 years old\n- Western Confections Paradise company vice president\n- Akira's younger brother\n- 28 years old\n- Hiroshi's wife\n- 31 years old\n- Akira's secretary\n",
    "Resolution": "She also made a fake blood trail from the building to the cake shop. That was necessary to be supposely discovered by the Detective Boys to make them think it was Ito. After she established an alibi, she went to kill the president, came to the shop, wore the same dress as Hanako, made a fake wound on her leg, and ate cake like nothing happened.\nShe then attempted to kill the last people standing in her way which was Hiroshi and his wife. Fortunately, Conan alerted Hiroshi beforehand that the killer was Yayoi and to have he and his wife pretend to be poisoned without eating the poisoned cake prepared by Yayoi. Her motive is that the president decided to make Japanese sweets instead of Western cakes. At first, the vice president and his wife also opposed the president, but in the end accepted the suggestion. Because of that, she also planned to murder them.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Storyboard artist Hiroaki Takagi revealed in his personal X account[1], that Urasawa devised another cause of death initially, but when he was planning for the episode, he proposed that it is necessary to be altered, and the current cause of death which the victim drowns in the red bean paste was actually director Yasuichiro Yamamoto's idea.\n- Hiroshi Ogawa is named after the actual Detective Conan prop designer Hiroshi Ogawa.\n- The red car is a 2014 convertible Chevrolet Corvette Stingray. The license plate is 新宿 300, に 5-93 (Shinjuku 300, Ni 5-93).\n",
