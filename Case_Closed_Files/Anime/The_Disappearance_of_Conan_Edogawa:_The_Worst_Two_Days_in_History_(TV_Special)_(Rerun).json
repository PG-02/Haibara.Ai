    "Situation": "Because Professor Agasa's bath is broken, Conan, Ran, and Haibara headed for a bath house. In the bath house , Conan notices a suspicious man opening a locker. Conan catches a glimpse of what is inside, and the man closes it quickly.\nWhile thinking about the man, Conan slips and hits his head on the ground. Before he could stand up, the suspicious man walked over to him and covered his mouth with a towel. Conan slowly fell unconscious. Then, the suspicious man and his partner say they're going to take Conan to a hospital and put him in their car.\nJust as Conan thought, the suspicious man was a legendary hit man with his accomplice. Hearing that Conan has been taken to the hospital, Ran and Haibara search the nearby hospital but he's no where to be found.  Suddenly, a mail saying \"My injury wasn't so bad. I'm going to go eat dinner with a man I know.\" reaches Ran. That email was from Shinichi.\nThe hit man and his accomplice who kidnapped Conan because they thought he noticed their plan, notices that Conan has amnesia due to the shock of the fall he had before. They use that amnesiac child for their next plan. First, they feed him another sleeping pill. Then, a woman enters and shoots two of the men dead, leaving the third, who she calls Kondo, the legendary hitman.\n\nThe second part of the plan is then unveiled. The woman notes that Conan has a ticket in his pocket to the Kamen Yaiba festival and asks Kondo to take him there. Conan is given a backpack full of explosives to wear. The explosives can be remotely detonated.\n",
