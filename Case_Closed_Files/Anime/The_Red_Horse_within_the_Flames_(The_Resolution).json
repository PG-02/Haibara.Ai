    "Characters introduced": "- Inspector from Arson Department\n",
    "Cast": "",
    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Heiji is asked by Kasukawa to investigate a man who is lurking near the house of Ryoko Morozumi. An arsonist, dubbed the Red Horse after the red horse figurines he leaves behind at the fires, has been burning precincts in order. With the first three having already experienced a fire, and Ryoko's house being on the fourth precinct, they suspect the strange man to be the arsonist. While Kogoro, Conan, and Heiji stalk the house, it catches fire in the middle of the night.\n\nThere are four suspected to be the arsonist: A salesmen named Takanori Genda, Ryoko's paramour and a Feng shui reader Misao Soga, Ryoko's sister Keiko Gondo, and Ryoko's husband Akira Morozumi. Since the latter three have established alibi's, this leaves Genda as their prime suspect.\nRan and Kazuha receive a red horse from Genda on the way home. Kogoro realizes that Genda plans to burn the Mouri Detective Agency with Ran and Kazuha in it and rushes home to find out that Genda had been arrested. Ran explains that Genda appeared at the agency asking for the red horse back since it will cause the building to be set ablaze and she called the police due to his strange behavior. Conan and Heiji suspect that while Genda was the cause of the first three fires, the fourth fire might have been created to murder Ryoko while placing the blame on Genda. Conan and Heiji investigate and realize that Genda has been experience psychological problems and that the other three suspects could have manipulated him to cause the fires. They investigate Ryoko's house and realize how the fire was started.\nAfter investigating Genda's home, they found out that there were covert listening devices planted by Soga and Gondo and realize who the culprit is.\n",
    "People": "- 42 years old\n- Antique store manager\n- Victim (burned)\n- 39 years old\n- Housewife\n- 45 years old\n- Feng Shui instructor\n- 41 years old\n- Fortune-teller\n- Ryoko's older sister\n- 45 years old\n- Psychiatrist\n- Ryoko's husband\n- Morozumis' neighbor\n- Kid's mother\n- Morozumis' neighbor\n",
    "Resolution": "The owner of the house where the first fire occurred was a customer of Genda and had gotten a key chain from him. But the fire broke and burned both the box and Guan Yu, leaving only the horse. The owner never got to open the box, so he honestly testified that he never saw the horse before. And because 'Red Horse' was an old police slang for 'arsonist', everyone jump to the conclusion that it was the beginning of a crime spree. Genda recognized the horse in the paper, but was confused that the owner claimed to not have seen it, so he became confused and sought out Dr. Akira Morozumi, thinking that he had begun sleepwalking again. Akira saw an opportunity to burn his wife's family home by using Genda as a scapegoat.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The kissing scene between Ryoko and Misao in the manga original was censored.\n- This case is like the plot of Agatha Christie's Murder Case with Hercule Poirot.\n",
