    "Situation": "Conan, Ran, and Kogoro arrive in Kanazawa via train and as they leave the station they see the Tsuzumimon gate. Kogoro has been asked to participate in the Kaga-Hyakumangoku mystery tour. Yuzo Tanimoto, a tourism association employee introduces himself first, followed by Moeko Miyazawa who also works for the association, Yuya Tadokoro, an event manager and Osamu Kuranishi and Harumi Akiyama who both also are employees for the association. After having received each business card, Kogoro introduces himself as the great detective and prepares to hand out his golden business cards.\nA case awaits this year's participants in Kanazawa and Kaga, they will meet up at certain checkpoints which are located at sightseeing spots and collect hints which have been created by Akiyama, in order to reveal the culprit. Believing that the mystery will be no problem for him, and since the employees wanted to test it on him, he agrees to take part in it and solve the mystery. They are given a guidebook which is supposed to help them with the hints, as well as a card which contains the first hint (The experience of \"Catching fleas\" in front of a mirror) which is decoded to lead towards the Kaga-Yuzen house of traditional commerce. While Ran is wearing a Kimono in the building, she receives positive feedback regarding it, and points out to Akiyama that she's wearing a watch which is intended, by model, for men, to which she replies that she had gotten it from her brother. Once finished, they are given the next hint and warned that it gets more difficult from there on. The next hint is quickly solved by Conan and is revealed to mean \"sweets experience\", which leads them towards a tourism-expo in the Ishikawa prefecture. Before they are able to leave they are interrupted by someone screaming who is getting mugged. The mugger is quickly stopped by Kogoro and throws the stolen bag at them, then heads off in the other direction. Kogoro returns the bag to its owner and is thanked by her. At the expo they are creating their own sweets with which Kogoro seems to struggle with a fair bit. At an art exhibition Conan's hunch turns out to be true and somebody appears to be following and recording them. He seems to think for a short moment that it might just be the couple who he has seen earlier taking a picture, but is quickly shocked having felt the same sensation. During lunch it is revealed that Osamu and Harumi are engaged, Yuya points out jokingly that it's a favourable coincidence that her father is the president of a known company. While eating, Conan asks Moeko why she is carrying a heavy bag with her, since she could've just left it in the bus, to which she reacts scared and desperate, but is saved by Ran who's scolding him, saying that the content of woman's bag is her own business. After a few comments regarding the look of a criminal, after they heard a news story on television, Ran asks Akiyama if she's well, who looks completely scared after, what appears to have been, a message on her phone.\nAfter a visit at the market, the group meets up with the employees again, with Akiyama apologizing since she has lost the next hint card, though she remembers its content. Back at the bus she prepares an improvised hint card which Kogoro is able to understand by himself. After its meaning is explained on location, the group splits up as they head forward, with Yuya, Osamu and Harumi leaving separately. In a lake house they are given the next hint which consists of three different symbols, which are revealed to lead to the Kanazawa castle, where they are given the next hint card. It is a rather simple substraction which leads to the Kanazawa 21st century Artmuseum. Suddenly the mugger from earlier arrives and attacks Mouri, who uses his trademark judo throw. As he starts running after the criminal he is first stopped by Yuzo, but quickly continues his pursuit. Conan spots the couple from earlier and as they see that they were spotted leave abruptly, but he follows them with Moeko following him. She trips, drops her bag and a camera falls out. The mugger appears again, complaining that Miyazawa hasn't informed him of Kogoro's strength. By a tree in the not so far distance the woman who was mugged earlier is also seen. Conan reveals that it has all been a setup and that Moeko was filming them earlier at the art exhibition. She apologizes and explains that the couple was actually their camera man and assistant, and the mugger and victim were actors. They tried setting up such a scene to help the PR of the event. She also reveals that both her and Akiyama had hidden cameras on them. The three men appear and everybody apologizes for the inconvience, asking for a chance to explain themselves.\nNear the castle they spot Akiyama on the floor, bludgeoned as Osamu runs towards her. He yells at the rest to call an ambulance and Conan observes that this might have been just a case of mugging, since her handbag is open and lying on the floor, but if it was just a random case then there should be more victims, concluding that the culprit must have targeted Akiyama.\n\n",

    "Resolution": "But in truth the drawings themselves actually had a hidden meaning. When decoded the drawings point out details from the robbery case that happened four years ago: the date, the type of crime, and finally the culprit. She wanted to use these new cards to send a secret message to Kogoro hoping he would help her, but before he could figure it out she was attacked by Kuranishi.\nAfter he attacked her, later when they found her he pretended to be concerned and went to check on her. But in actuality what he wanted was to take the watch she was wearing because it had been modified and embedded with a hidden camera. This camera most likely captured the beginning and aftermath of the attempted murder which is why he took her watch.\n",
