    "Situation": "Conan and Agasa decided to bring a very sick Haibara to the clinic, but the clinic happened to be filled and they had to wait at least two hours before their turn. They then decided to first have lunch at a nearby shopping mall. At the car park of the shopping mall, they spot four porsches, with a drunk man sleeping in one of them. Later, Conan and Agasa meet Ran, Sonoko and Jodie at a restaurant while Haibara rested in Agasa's car. Conan noticed Jodie's suspicions when she heard Ran mention Haibara. He was then interviewed by a TV crew and decided to return to the car and bring Haibara away as he knew he could have been spotted by people from the Black Organization through television. However, when he returned to the car park, the man in the porsche was found dead, and Conan has to solve the case.\n\nHaibara and Agasa could not leave the shopping mall as the exit was blocked by the police. Jodie notices the sick Haibara in Agasa's car and remembers her from the bus hijacking case. Jodie thinks she knows Haibara's true identity. Agasa decides to call Tomoaki Araide since Haibara is very sick.\n",
    "People": "- 39 years old\n- Far left green Porsche 356 A (1955–59) owner\n- 45 years old\n- Middle left white Porsche 911 (classic) 1963 owner\n- Victim (strangled)\n- 41 years old\n- Middle right red Porsche 928 owner\n- 34 years old\n- Far right dark blue Porsche Boxster (986) owner\n- Gourmet Corner announcer\n- TMS news announcer\n- Driver stuck in underground parking lot\n- Haido Department Store underground parking lot staff\n- Tokyo MPD forensics officer\n- Customer\n",
    "Resolution": "\n- Deceased (car accident)\n- Kaoru Taiyama's brother\nTaiyama confesses and says Banba was responsible for a car accident prank (tossing water) that caused her and her brother's Giallo Modena 1994 Ferrari F355 Berlinetta to be destroyed along with the latter's death. His supposed lack of regret for the prank drove her to kill.\nAfter Conan solved the case, he rush back to Agasa's car but both of them have been disappered. Agasa tell him that they have back to Agasa’s house by Jodie's help. Araide and Jodie treats Haibara well.  Shuichi Akai also overhears the conversation outside the house.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Four Porsche in scene from left to right are Dark Green Porsche 356 A (Hotei), White 1965 Porsche 911 [901] (Kureko), Guards Red 1978 Porsche 928 (Banba), and Porsche Cobalt Blue Metallic 1997 Porsche Boxster [986] (Taiyama).\n- Taiyama's brother Vehicle in past battle is Giallo Modena 1994 Ferrari F355 Berlinetta.\n- The remote control toy car in box is Blue 1969 Porsche 911 S.\n- This case is the first case that Haibara is sick.\n- The photograph that Shuichi Akai had in his truck, was the very same picture that he had in the post-credit scene of Secret of the Tohto Film Development Studio.\n- The Porsche's License Plates from left to right are Dark Green, 80-12 (Hotei), White, 40-07 (Kureko), Guards Red, 9-13 (Banba), and Cobalt Blue Metallic, 3-12 (Taiyama).\n- Shuichi Akai is driving a pick-up truck with the license plate of 12-02.\n- Although on Akai's truck television, it stated that the serial arsonist has yet to be apprehended, so either the media is left out of the loop in The Red Horse within the Flames case, or there is another one on the loose.\n- This is the first time that Jodie heard Ai-chan's name, and also heard that she has a bad cold.\n- This is the second case, where Conan winds up on TV, being interviewed by the media. The first time was The Trembling Police Headquarters: 12 Million Hostages, after he disarmed a bomb.\n- This is the first case that Dr. Araide sees Haibara.\n- This case revealed that Akai had Dr. Araide's phone tapped, since he was listening to Agasa's phone conversation with him.\n- In the post scene, both Dr. Araide and Jodie are at Agasa's place, while the Doctor is looking after Haibara.\n- Sometime off-screen, and probably while they are at Agasa's house, they both plant listening devices inside of Agasa's place. Although one of them probably wants to listen in on the other bug more than eavesdropping on just any conversation.\n- Proof that BOTH of them planted some bugs in Professor Agasa's house was when Conan was on the phone with Agasa, and Akai was listening in on their conversation. Either, he is listening in on a newly placed bug, or it was Agasa's phone that was bugged earlier, and that seems to still be in the Professor's beetle, and Conan is on the earring cellphone.\n",
