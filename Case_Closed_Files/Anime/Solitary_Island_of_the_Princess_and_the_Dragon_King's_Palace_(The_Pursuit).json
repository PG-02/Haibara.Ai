    "Situation": "Conan visits the Southern Island with Kogoro, Ran, Heiji, and Kazuha, only to realise that yet another case was available for them to solve and this time, it was a case written on the beach.\nHeiji and Kogoro are invited to Okinawa to solve the case of a body that was found on Onikame (鬼亀 ?, lit. Demon Turtle) island alongside a mysterious carved message by the body.\n\nThe deduction battle between the two shall be televised in order to boast the declining tourism of Okinawa. Heiji, Conan, Ran, and Kazuha head to the island to investigate and are accompanied by four TV station employees. They find the mysterious message as \"The sleeping place of a princess shall be Kō and not Otu\" where Kō and Otu could stand for multiple meanings. When Yoshie Taira is found strangled from rope, the dying message \"I am a Servitor of Goosoh\", Heiji realises she must have found something and dives into the water only to find an anchor.\n\nWhen they prepare to head back, they find out the captain left with the boat, stranding them on the Onikame. They decide to wait in an abandoned house until a rescue boat arrives.\nHeiji tells them the Anchor he found was approximately four to five years old, the same time period on which the strange events have been occurring on Onikame. It began with the mayor's daughter, Miyako Kenshiro, who was kidnapped and a year after that, burglars broke into the mayor's house stealing his byōbu and murdering a maid. The burglars had been the same people who were responsible for the kidnapping. In both incidents the mayor refused to pay ransom, and Miss Miyako and the byōbu are still missing today. They decide to search the house in case the culprit was hiding in one of the rooms and come upon evidence that Miyako lived in the house when she was young. After finding the house secure, they await for a boat. In the middle of the night, a boat crashes onto the pier. They investigate and find out it was their boat from before and that the captain was beaten to death.\n\nThey find out the boat was set on autopilot and realize that the culprit of the murders is actually one of the four TV staff members with them.\nWhen Conan and Heiji find the name \"Kaa\" and \"Chi\" written by Miyako many years ago, they realize who the names are referring to. Conan and Heiji have an epiphany and realize the culprit faked Taira's time of death. Heiji then calls Yoshitsuga Kume, one of the staff members, so they could talk privately.\n",
