    "Situation": "Kogoro and Conan happens to walk by a famous writer's house. They see patrol cars surrounding the house and meet Megure and Takagi. Takagi reveals the famous writer was found shot to death in his house. Both Kogoro and Conan check the crime scene with Megure and Takagi.\n\nSeemingly, the victim Tawake was shot while he was sleeping on the sofa. In addition, the victim was killed in a room that sunlight isn't permitted to pass through, due to the north-facing window the room possess. The estimated time of death is around noon, and most likely he was shot by the shotgun that was tossed nearby the sofa.\nAfter a tremendous search with regards to the crime scene, Conan discovered several clues that might come handy towards the case. Firstly, there are blood stains scattered on that north-facing window. However, surprisingly, the curtains aren't contaminated by the blood stain. This implies that the crime might have been carried out with the curtains opened and was closed by the culprit in all likelihood. If that is the case, then why didn't the culprit bother to do that?\nSecondly, the house that is located in front of that north-facing window seems to be vacant, which all shutters of it are closed. This is a great environment for the crime because that it will not be spotted by the neighbour, plus that there is also a construction going around nearby this conceals the sound of the shotgun. Last but not least, the forensics guy come across with a wooden tiny bench which has blood deposited as well. Conan once again contemplates: \"Why would that be necessary?\"\nAfter a while, Conan and the police meets the four apprentices of Tawake. The cropse was discovered by Akaike and Degawa, they all claim that they didn't touch the crime scene. Owing to the death of this mystery author, Akaike then cancels the appointment of dentist he asked yesterday which was instructed by Tawake himself. Through their conversations, the police notices that they all call their teacher the \"Demon King\". The reason turns out to be that Tawake forces his apprentices to be ghost writers for him. That is, to write books for him, and publish it with only a few modifications of his. Furthermore, Tawake's reputation doesn't look so great according to his apprentices. He had always pledged them that they will gain the chance to debut one day if they persistently write books for him. Nonetheless, that isn't the case as he lied towards them.\nAs the four of them have don't get along with the victim very well, they now become the crucial suspects of the case, this leads to the verification of their alibis. Finally, they were only able to confirm Akaike's alibi. The rest was apparently writing when the crime was implemented, so they don't have alibis, they then get into a quarrel to blame each other for the crime. Since the victim was fed with sleeping pills before his death, Akaike deduces the murderer must be an outsider because if the culprit is capable of slipping the pill, he will also be able to just directly poison him.\n\"Is this the truth?\" Conan looked at himself in doubt. \"Wait a minute,\" the bloodstain behind the curtains, the noisy construction area, the north-facing window, the contaminated wooden bench, as well as... The shotgun that belongs to the victim... These trivial clues have now jointed together, Conan then picks up a small piece of aluminium foil from the floor. All of his perplex have now faded away utterly, he chuckled: \"I have finally figured out the trick that the culprit used.\"\n",
    "People": "- Victim (gunshot)\n- 55 years old\n- Mystery writer\n- 38 years old\n- Tawake's apprentice\n- 30 years old\n- Tawake's apprentice\n- 35 years old\n- Tawake's apprentice\n- 33 years old\n- Tawake's apprentice\n",
    "Resolution": "The culprit made a trick to shoot the shotgun automatically, by tying the weapon onto the wooden bench (which is the one that had the blood stains on top of it) with strings, this is a phenomenon that causes fire due to the focused sunlight that will ignite the bullet and will eventually shoot it. Meanwhile, those apprentices of Tawake have instantly noticed that this is the famous trick prevalent in mystery novels. However, Bito pointed out that it is impossible to work in the cirme scene, because in order for the sunlight to ignite the shotgun deposited on the wooden bench, it must be in a south-facing room. In reality, to make this work in a north-facing room, which is basically the crime scene, the culprit used a concave mirror made with aluminum foil and put inside the neighbouring room which seemed to be vacant, the sunlight this way will reflect and bounce off the mirror that causes a change in direction to reach the bullet.\nTo conceal the shotgun noise, the culprit picked the time when there were external noises that may disguise the gunshot, which is the construction racket. The reason that the culprit gave sleeping pills to the victim is to make Tawake to stay stationary which can allow this automated trick to hit the target. This trick also explains why the culprit needed to shut the curtains, this is to prevent the trick to be revealed, as it might look obvious if they left the open. Additionally, the culprit uses this method is to create an alibi, so the culprit is the one with an alibi, Naoya Akaike.\nAs a murderer, Akaike decided to discover the body of Tawake along with Degawa, to drag someone to prove for his innocent and to ensure that none of them have altered any of the crime scene.\n",
