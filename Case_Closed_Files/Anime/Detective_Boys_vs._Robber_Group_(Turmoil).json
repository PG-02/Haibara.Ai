    "Situation": "Jodie Starling encounters a man on the street in the Beika district who looks exactly like Shuichi Akai, but with a huge burn scar on the side of his face. After chasing him to an alley where he disappears, she dismisses it as an illusion. She heads to the bank to withdraw some money when a bank robbery occurs. The heavily armed bank robbers begin taking cellphones away from the customers and separate them into two groups; one group are customers who are with relatives or friends, and the others are those who are alone. They order those who are alone to bind the hands, eyes, and mouth of the rest of the patrons.\n\nMeanwhile, Jodie discovers that the man siting next to her is the Akai-lookalike. After shaking him and trying to get him to speak without success, Jodie thinks this man may be Akai, but he lost his memory and voice after he survived the assassination by the Black Organization. Focusing back on the situation at hand, Jodie manages to lure one of the robbers to the bathroom by pretending she needed to use the toilet and incapacitated him. After she removes the tape binding her, she finds the Detective Boys are hiding in the stalls. Jodie tells Conan the bank robbers are separating people into two groups, taping their mouth and eyes, and they seem focused on the time for some reason. Jodie is knocked out from behind by one of the robbers who came to check on them, and the Detective Boys evade detection by hiding in one of the stalls. The remaining robbers take the ski-mask and jumpsuit off of the unconscious body of the robber incapacitated by Jodie and leave him propped up on the toilet. Conan and the Detective Boys then formulate a plan to capture the four bank robbers.\nThe people who came alone to the bank have nearly finished binding the remaining customers with duct tape, including scar Akai. The head robber orders the bank manager to do something secret that is written on a note instead of load the money that he had collected from the vault earlier into briefcases. The bank robbers then begin to bind the customers who came alone with duct tape. The Detective boys lure one of the robbers into a trap by having Conan call him using the cellphone and voice of the robber Jodie knocked unconscious. Conan notices something strange about the guy they just nabbed; he had taken off his disguise and coat.\n",
    "People": "- Teito Bank branch manager\n- Five bank robbers' boss\n- One of five bank robbers\n- One of five bank robbers\n- One of five bank robbers\n- One of five bank robbers\n- Police officer in charge of the squad for storming the bank\n- Riot squad police officer\n- Riot squad police officer\n- Riot squad police officer\n",
    "Resolution": "Conan realizes that the robbers plan to escape the bank by pretending to be hostages. Conan reveals to the Detective Boys that from the evidence of the robbers dialogue, they plan to choose five hostages, without friends or relatives so they couldn't be quickly identified, and disguise them as the bank robbers using their ski-masks and jackets. The money collected by the manager, the manager himself, and the five hostages along with Jodie who had seen one of the members' face were placed by bombs hidden in cases to make it look like the bank robbers accidentally blew themselves and the manager up while trying to break into the vault. The real goal of the heist was what was written in the secret note: an order to the manager to electronically transfer large amounts of money to the robbers' accounts oversea. However, their complex plan is doomed to fall from the start due to the laws regarding transfering large amount of money abroad, and the police would quickly catch on this irregularity and eventually the robber themselves.\nThe Detective Boys manage to detonate the explosives safely in an elevator and Conan manages to locate the three robbers who have mingled into the crowd. However, Conan is grabbed by a robber who regained consciousness and is about to be killed when the robber is shot by Scar Akai.\n\n",
    "Trivia": "- The five bank robbers weapons' are a Smith & Wesson Model 29 - .44 Magnum (boss), a Heckler & Koch MP5NA2 (robber B), and a Tokarev TT-33s (other robbers).\n- Scar Akai's weapon that was used to shoot the fourth bank robber is a Beretta 92FS.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- The anime version created a minor error by showing Scar Akai's scar and the skin where the duct tape over his eyes had formerly been. Removing the tape should have tore the mask over Scar Akai's face at the time. In the manga, Scar Akai's face is drawn much more ambiguously: the gun and the shadow of the hat Scar Akai is wearing hide the scar and the part of his face where the tape had been removed.\n",
