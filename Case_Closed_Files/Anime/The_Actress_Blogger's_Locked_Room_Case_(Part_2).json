    "Situation": "It started when Conan, Haibara, Professor Agasa, and the Detective Boys are in the hotel hall, winning a cake buffet in the game \"spin the wheel\". They meet Saya Kitami after the toy helicopter was put on Genta's cake, and a later while they meet Kyona Shono. The two famous actresses hate each other. They made a bet about the popularity of their blog: the one who will lose will have her hair shaved. Conan and the others leave the hotel after eating, but Conan notices that Sakurako Yonehara is asking for a key to Kyona's room, who she was supposed to wake up. After explaining to Conan that Kyona is not replying in her room, every one rushes in Kyona's room, and discovers her dead body on the floor.\n\nConan discovers that secret Kyona has discovered, but he doubts that it's something that was worth killing for, until he sees something else in the picture. He realize that the locked room hadn't been her intention at the beginning. The police are still baffled at the crime scene. Takagi and Megure decides to call their superintendent for orders, when the door bell rings. Megure sees through the peek hole that it's Professor Agasa standing outside, but when he opens the door, he finds Conan instead who tells them that they needs to come down to Saya's room below. While Megure is a bit doubtful, Takagi, who has been on the phone with the superintendent, says that they are being ordered to do as Conan says. In Saya's room, Conan uses Professor Agasa's voice to explain his deduction.\n",

    "Resolution": "Her motive was that she thought Kyona knew she had accidentally killed an old man in a car accident and fled the crime scene, but Conan reveals that the only secret Kyona knew was that Saya was actually five years older than she claimed to be. The unhappy misunderstanding happened because Saya saw a manga series in the picture with the title 'The hit and run of love' and thought that Kyona was referring to 'Hit and Run' which in English means to cause an accident with a car and flee the scene.\n\n- Victim (Hit by a car)\nWhat she never noticed was the that Kyona is very neat and meticulous with everything she did as shown in her selfies that she posted often. But in the photo with the Code, the manga series in question had its volumes in the wrong order and had two of the same volumes as well. The manga series was set up so the numbers when replaced with hiragana in a simple number code would form the sentence 'Saya is 29 years old.' With this revelation, Saya breaks down in tears as she had murdered Kyona for no reason at all.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- The anime version starts with a scene showing professor Agasa playing a lucky balls game gambling while the manga version only talks about it\n",
    "Trivia": "- The painting about Mount Fuji in the hotel reception is from The Devil's Circuit.\n- The names of the suspects come from remote-controlled toy makers[1]:\n- Saya Kitami (北見 沙弥) comes from Tamiya (タミヤ);\n- Kyōna Shōno (庄野 杏奈) comes from Kyōshō (京商).\n",
