    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Heiji invites Conan, Ran, and Kogoro to visit him in Osaka, taking them on a sightseeing tour. In a restaurant, they run into Kazuha Toyama, Heiji's childhood friend, who appears to be jealous of Ran, asking her if she's \"that Kudo girl\" that Heiji keeps talking about and telling Ran to back off, because Heiji and her have been \"joined by steel\" for ages. Ran laughs and explains herself and the two girls hit it off. After finishing their meal, Kazuha joins them on their exploration of the city, but, as they leave the restaurant, a dead body falls from the roof of the building, hitting Kogoro's rental car.\nThe police arrive and quickly realise that this newest victim, a man in his forties, has been killed in the same fashion as two other people who died a few days earlier, by being stabbed in the heart through their wallets.\n\n\n\n\nEventually, they discover that the victims as well as MP Goji all attended the same driving school and were involved in a fatal accident 20 years prior. Heiji, who makes the discovery, decides to confront the MP.\nConan joins Ran and Kazuha who tell him that Osaka Police have discovered the hiding place of a criminal on the run, and that they suspect said criminal, Kiichiro Numabuchi, to be involved in the murders.\n",

    "Resolution": "- Deceased (car accident)\n- Driving instructor\n- Yusuke's father\n- Tetsuji's wife\n- Yusuke's mother\n\n",
    "Evidence": "- Yusuke has an uncanny resemblance to his father.\n- Like the murder victims, Yusuke also adjusts his rear-view mirror before he starts his car, a habit taught to them by Yusuke's father, a driving instructor.\n",
    "Conclusion": "The killer is Yusuke Sakata, one of the police officers. His real name is Yusuke Inaba.\n",
    "Motive": "\nYusuke's father Tetsuji was a driving instructor who died in an accident 20 years ago. Six of his students had played a prank on him by plying him with alcohol, and he suffered a fatal car crash. The students involved in the fatal prank were the four murder victims, MP Sotaro Goshi, and the escaped convict Numabuchi. They had done so because he was always strict with them and they hated that, all they wanted to do was scare him a little not kill him.\nSakata says he had always wondered about his father's death, he was usually a very careful driver. When he stumbled upon Numabuchi after he had escaped from prison, the latter got frightened and asked \"Instructor Inaba\" immediately for forgiveness, confusing Yusuke with his father. Yusuke heard the true story behind his father's death and forced Numabuchi to stay in the hut in the forest, planning to take revenge on the other five students before eventually framing Numabuchi for the murders, and making his death look like a suicide.\n\n\n\nBoth Heiji and Sakata manage to escape blaze and are taken to the hospital, however before being taken to the hospital Sakata talks to Ginshiro Toyama about everything that’s happened. When suddenly Sotaro Goshi tries to attack Sakata after learning he had killed his friends and was after him as well, but is stopped by Ginshiro who states that they need to have a conversation about his past, leaving Goshi hanging his head in shame.\n",
    "Aftermath": "",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga, Heiji remarks that the trick that was used to make the corpse of the third victim fall to the ground is the same as the one used in a case that Kogoro (or rather, Conan) solved before. This part was removed in the anime.\n",
    "Translation changes": "",
    "Anime": "- The names of the characters in the Funimation Dub are:\n- Yusuke Sakata - Truman Salinger\n- Sotaro Goshi - Congressman Grady\n- Tayo Nishiguchi - Tammy Nightengale\n- Hidetoshi Nagao - Nathan Tollingsworth\n- Kazuto Noyasu - Castron Odalis\n- Sumie Okazaki - Susan Connely\n- Ki'ichiro Numabuchi - Cornelius Graver\n",
    "Rerun": "- The episode was rerun on July 19, 2004. It was unchanged except for the addition of a new scene at the beginning.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is the only episode where Masato Sako voiced Ginshiro Toyama, as he developed tongue cancer in July 2000 (thus cancelling all his acting plans) and later passed away on January 11, 2003.\n- In the English Dub, for unknown reasons the last scene showing Hattori in the ambulance was cut out and never shown.\n",
