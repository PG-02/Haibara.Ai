    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "After the school trip, the case that occurred back at Kyoto attracts global attention, and someone claims that the apparently dead Shinichi Kudo helped to solve the case. Hyoue Kuroda, Kanenori Wakita, and Rumi Wakasa (who is revealed to have access to the APTX victim list) all take notice of this.\nMaria Higashio hasn't come to school today and Kobayashi sends Haibara and the Detective Boys to her home to see how she's doing and if everything's all right.\n\nMeanwhile, Conan, bed-ridden with a cold, enjoys Ran's agreement to hook up. He goes to see Professor Agasa and reads in the news that someone saw Shinichi at Kyoto and on TV. He starts being very nervous and asks Haibara and Heiji about it, while Ran, Sonoko, and Masumi read it as well. The media overrun Heiji and Shinichi's high schools, and Shinichi's house, although Okiya denies them entry. The Detective Boys believe Maria went to her late paternal grandparents' house and took part in the scavenger hunt they organized for her. Haibara helps the Detective Boys to follow the arrows and understand the messages. As they followed the clues, they arrive in a room where a bookshelf was knocked over, and fear Maria might be stuck under it. But it's not the case and there is instead another code to decipher.\nThe Detective Boys discover that Maria went downstairs and try to find the other arrows. Shinichi has still trouble finding who the \"Kudo Family Freak\" blog owner is and how to stop the media from blowing up. Ran tries to figure out what happened and why Shinichi is considered a ghost. Heiji tells Conan he'll try to settle things on his side. The Detective Boys finally arrive to a bathroom but the only arrow points to the shower with nothing inside it. They convince Haibara to ask for Conan's help, and the latter tells them to give some water to the drinking bird next to the arrow.\nThe Detective Boys give the drinking bird a glass of water and the bird starts to constantly dip its beak into it. They then notice the glass's water has reversed the arrow's direction, which now points towards the opposite direction of the bathroom. Another room which the kids fail to open. Wakita rings the doorbell at Professor Agasa's door and asks what the fuss in front of their neighbours' house is all about since he can't do his deliveries.\nConan tells the Detective Boys that the door isn't locked but the difference in temperatures between the cold corridor and the warm room where Maria is, creates a pressure gradient that can be dispelled by pushing the door strongly and opening a vent. Maria is indeed inside, asleep. She had come to watch some videos of her grandparents, but was then unable to open the door to leave the room, and concluded that she had to watch every video for the door to open.\nAs the room was accidentally airtight, Maria likely fell asleep due to heightened carbon dioxyde from her own breathing, which would have worsened if the Detective Boys hadn't found her in time.\n",
    "People": "- Deceased (illness)\n- Maria's paternal grandfather\n- Carpenter\n- Deceased\n- Maria's paternal grandmother\n- \"Kudo Family Freak\" blog owner\n- Yusaku and Yukiko's fan\n",
    "Resolution": "Heiji tells the press outside his school that it was Okita that was caught on film and not Shinichi. At the same time, the owner of the blog suddenly retracts her claim that she saw Shinichi.\nAs Wakita, Wakasa, and Kuroda look at the retraction, Rum sends an email to Bourbon, demanding that he gather information about Shinichi Kudo.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Just before this case, the special episode which introduced Renya Karasuma was remastered as a two-halves episode.\n- The Secret of the Moon, the Star, and the Sun was before Haibara transferred in the manga, while in the anime version she didn't want to come along, so the Detective Boys' statement is wrong.\n- Just like in The Darkest Nightmare, Rum was only given a computerized altered voice, and the ending credits do not list a voice actor. They did this intentionally so that no one could look up what other characters that voice actor might play.\n- The manga in Maria's room, Zero-kai Watch (０界ウォッチ ,Zero-kai Wocchi?), comes the videogame and manga franchise Yo-kai Watch. The name of the author, Ayumu Hariyama (針山 歩), comes from the saying \"walking on a mountain full of needles\", a reference to hell, which is where the title \"Zero-kai\" (０界) comes from.[1]\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- Gerozaemon Geroda and Namako-Otoko, who appear as dolls in Maria's basement, are removed in the anime version.\n",
