Shijo tells her she will read it later and gives Ran her room key's diamond keychain as compensation. Later that evening, Shijo's guests realize she has been in her room for far too long. Unable to open her door, they see her through the outside window dead.\n\nOne of her guests, Kensuke Katsuragi, climbs to the top of Shijo's room and breaks through the glass ceiling and unlocks the door.
