    "Resolution": "Before Mayama was killed, he had talked to someone. Imazu says that he was blackmailed by someone. Imazu was investigating who was the caller at that time. After several minutes, he didn't come out. So Imazu decided to give up in investigating. He was supposed to blame Imazu and the mask that was missing.\nThe suspects were Hirai, Imazu and Shimomura, Hirai was out of the suspect, it is because they go with Kogoro, Ran, and Conan together in the cave.\nThe culprit is Shozo Shimomura. After the crime was committed, he realize that Hirai was opening the cave in 10:00 AM, he thought that Hirai would call the police, but here's no service, so he has the time to commit it. His motive is he can't forgive the mayor, who had taken a bribe to allow a big company to turn the mountain into a landfill. He says that he broke his own city.\n"
