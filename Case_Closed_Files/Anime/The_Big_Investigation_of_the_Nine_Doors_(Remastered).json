    "Resolution": "\nHasegawa attempts to drug Conan, but Conan puts her to sleep with his tranquillizer. He then rescues the real Misato, and soon the police arrives to arrest Hasegawa. She reveals that Akihiko (i.e. Misato's husband) was a colleague of hers, and that after finding out that she was embezzling huge amounts of money from the company, he reported this to the company. This got Hasegawa fired, and she has since been planning to take revenge and murder him. This is why she went to Akihiko's apartment; however, it was Misato who opened the door. So Hasegawa had no choice but drug her, hide her in the storage room and wait for Akihiko to return home.\n",
