    "Situation": "Conan and his friends were playing Frisbee at the park, when a dog named Matsunosuke launched off of Conan's head and caught the Frisbee. Matsunosuke's owner, Kanae Asakawa, apologized and took Conan's jacket in order to get it cleaned after Matsunosuke left dirt all over it. The next day when Conan and the Detective Boys arrived at her house to get the jacket they met Kanae's friend Tomoko and see Matsunosuke in his dog house, asleep.\n\n",
    "People": "- 21 years old\n- Kanae's grandson\n- Unemployed\n- Kanae's dog\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- 65 years old\n- Matsunosuke's owner\n- Retired\n- 52 years old\n- Kanae's dog friend\n- 54 years old\n- Kanae's neighbor\n- Sokichi's friend\n- Disputes regularly shogi matches\n- Neighborhood resident\n- Mall butcher\n- Neighborhood resident\n- Park regular\n- Tokyo MPD CSI officer\n- Mall flower shop owner\n- Kanae's aquaintance\n- Hiramoto's dog\n- Shiba Inu\n",
    "Resolution": "Then, she cleaned away the breakfast she prepared and put on her coat that had just come back from the cleaners to make it look like she had been killed after walking her dog. After that, she left Shinpei's bandana which she prepared earlier by the front door and went for a walk with Matsunosuke disguised as Kanae to create eyewitness that Kanae walked Matsunosuke that day establishing her alibi.\nShe could've been found really easily but fooled everyone by having the dog with her. Matsunosuke did what he usually did like marking his spot at the usual place and fighting with the cat like he always did and everybody thought it was it was the elderly lady (Kanae). But in actuality, she made a mistake, by turning right after leaving the park though the real Kanae always turned left.\nHowever she had no choice but to take a detour. If she'd walked the whole route, she wouldn't be able to establish her alibi. So, she directly went back to her house with Matsunosuke and met with someone she called out to complete her alibi. Stunned, Tomoko tells Conan that Matsunosuke was sleeping when they arrived so it would be impossible for her to complete the crime.\nConan however says that the dog that is currently sleeping is in fact a look like dog. She had in fact, prepared a look like Matsunosuke that would be drugged and sleeping. It meant that the killer must of have had a dog just like Matsunosuke. As Tomoko said, she had Matsunosuke's brother which coincide with the evidence.\nAfter finishing their deduction, the police arrive. To defend herself, Tomoko tells them these children keep saying strange things. Megure asks if it wasn't Kogoro that called them. Conan told them that he was right but that Kogoro couldn't come because so he brought the kids there. Hirota replies by saying there is no proof but Conan immediately stops her and points to the proof right by her side: the dog she swapped, the real Matsunosuke.\nShe protests and says the dog tied to her leash is hers but it is in fact Matsunosuke because Genta yells him to come get the frisbee and only Matsunosuke would run after it. Seeing that she has been cornered Tomoko surrenders herself. Conan goes up to her and tells her that it wasn't the dog's fault that she was found out but it was in fact the mistake she had made while cleaning the breakfast: Kanae always ate her breakfast after walking her dog so, if she had been killed after her walk, it would have been impossible for her to have eaten and cleaned her breakfast and it would be strange for her to be wearing her coat if she had cleaned her breakfast after her death. In conclusion, she had given herself away from the beginning.\n- Tomoko's dog\n",
