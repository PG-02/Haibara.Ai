    "Situation": "Yumi drives by Detective Takagi who had gotten off of work early for a one night trip. She asks Takagi if he is going on a date with Miwako, something which Takagi forcefully denies: \"No, it's not a date!\" Back at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Headquarters, Yumi asks Sato if she knows where Takagi is going. All they can deduce is that it might have something to do with a report Takagi met with Inspector Megure about earlier. Sato wonders if Takagi has forgotten the anniversary of his mentor Wataru Date's death.\n\nAt the airport, Takagi opens his notebook. It's marked with \"Greet Parents\" and contains a ring. Takagi breaks into tears, no longer confident in his ability to make Sato happy.\nThe next day, as the Detective Boys approach the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Headquarters where they were scheduled to for a crime prevention project, a strange old man asks them if they are the acquaintances of Wataru Takagi. He handed them a gift which was to be passed on to Sato and opened quickly. As the man leaves, Conan catches up with the Detective Boys. As Conan asks the Detective Boys about the man, Amuro appears! Amuro tells the four children he was called back in for questioning so the police could decide whether he'd gone too far during the Detectives' Nocturne case. As he walks away, Amuro mentions that he had another reason for coming here, but that reason has already disappeared.\nMeanwhile in police headquarters, Sato continues to collect clues from the other officers about where Takagi's whereabouts. Sato is shocked to hear from Detective Chiba that he saw Takagi crying over a photo of a woman in his notebook. When Chiba asked if it was of Sato, Takagi angrily denied it. Before Sato can question further, she receives a call from Conan.\nIn the hall, the Detective Boys gave the present to Sato. It turns out to be a tablet PC displaying a live feed of Takagi bound up with rope and tape while asleep. The feed cycles through several camera angles, revealing Takagi's body is on a wooden plank with a sheet in a partially constructed building. As Sato and the Detective Boys watch in horror, Takagi regains consciousness.\n\nAlthough Shiratori felt that the Anti-Cybercrime Division can find the footage's location, it will take a long time. He suggested taking the tablet apart and charged directly from inside in order to retrieve the data, to which Conan said it was too risky. Superintendent Matsumoto ordered Megure to contact Haneda Airport on whether Takagi was on any passenger list last night, Shiratori to check his computer information on his likely whereabouts, Chiba to watch the tablet's video, Sato to question the Detective Boys who're waiting in another room and every police detective to investigate everyone connected with Takagi's prior investigations.\nThe Detective Boys recounted their encounter with the man. The man knew Takagi by his full name, yet only knew Sato as Takagi's detective girlfriend. Chiba came to report to Sato, who rushed back and to her horror saw Takagi almost falling off the board. However, it turned out that Takagi was dropping his police notebook.\nSuperintendent Matsumoto was wondering about Takagi's clueless disappearance when a police detective suddenly remembered seeing Takagi coming out of the Record Office last week while crying. Matsumoto ordered them to search through the records.\nWhile Conan and Sato are taking a walk through the hall, Conan learnt that the records that Takagi looked at that day were three cases of women who committed suicide by hanging themselves about a year ago. They all had no signs of foul play, so they were out of the jurisdiction.\n\n\n\nThe fraudster was caught but the charge wasn't fraud, but murder. He'd been shouldering quite large debts, and having trouble with a loan shark so he went and stabbed someone. Sato thinks Date caught him.\nStraight after catching the fraudster, Date died in a traffic accident. He'd dropped his notebook, and was hit by a driver who'd fallen asleep at that wheel, according to Takagi. They were both on a night stakeout, and Date was trying to show Takagi something in his notebook when he got hit. The black notebook Takagi has was inherited from Date. Date was Takagi's mentor and were known as the \"Wataru Brothers\". Date's name is Wataru Date. His name was Wataru, just like Takagi's.\nMeanwhile at night, Takagi is still breathing and is still lying in prone position on the wooden board.\nIn Sato's car the children discuss the case. Genta wonders that the medical student hit Detective Date with her car, but Sato says that she hit someone else, and the driver who hit Date was caught. Ayumi suggests that maybe Takagi had been secretly dating the english teacher, but Sato finds it unlikely, given that the teacher's calendar had the english word 'Date' written all over, and a police detective can't go on dates everyday. Mitsuhiko then wonder if it's connected to the hostess, who hanged herself, after Takagi's close friend and mentor Detective Date arrested her boyfriend. But Sato explain that the hostess hanged herself because she discovered that her boyfriend was a marriage fraudster. The police couldn't be blamed for that. Conan asks Sato to learn more about Detective Date, because he finds it curious that both he and Takagi share the same given name.\n\nThe culprit was Ryusaku Fuemoto, who was also a teacher at the school one of the suicide victims, Natalie Kuruma, was in. She was Date's girlfriend, and Fuemoto assumed that Takagi was Date as they had the same given name and because Natalie had only told her parents, whom she normally communicated in English with, that her boyfriend's name was Wataru and that he was a police detective. And to make matter worse the police had originally concluded that the reason behind Natalie's suicide was due to have dumped by her boyfriend, since they didn't know that she was Date's girlfriend and Sato has misread the name Date in romaji on Natalie's calendar as the English word 'Date'. Takagi had probably realized that Natalie was Date's girlfriend after a year had passed and contacted Fuemoto to inform him that Date didn't dump her, but was killed in an accident. Fuemoto considered Natalie as a surrogate daughter, identified her corpse after her suicide, and was so distressed that he kidnapped Takagi to \"punish\" him for her death. However, once he was located by the VERY angry Sato and other police members, it turns out he had consumed poisoned wine; he lived enough to hear Sato telling him that he had trapped the wrong man, but not to tell her where his victim was.\nTakagi's location becomes narrowed down to Hokkaido thanks to the Western Jackdaw (a bird that's usually found there), the phenomenon known as the \"snow pillar\" (which only takes place in VERY cold environments, like the snowy Hokkaido), and kites that appeared on the camera (during these days, a kite-related festival takes place there). The police are unable to get his specific position although Takagi is apparently in a four-story building. Later, Conan realizes that the building might not be a four-story building after all: the mirrors around cause an optical illusion.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (poison)\n- Former teacher of English conversation school\n- Deceased (hanged)\n- 6th year at Tohto University Medical School\n- Hanged herself over having committed a hit and run\n- Deceased (hanged)\n- Lecturer\n- Hanged herself over being dumped\n- Deceased (hanged)\n- Hostess\n- Hanged herself over a fraudster boyfriend\n- Komamae City, san-chome resident\n- Scholar\n- Komamae City, san-chome resident\n- Scholar\n",
    "Resolution": "Conan reveals that the building is actually a second-story building; a mirror was used to make it seem like a four-story building. Takagi manages to get rid of his gag; Conan is able to read his lips, deducing his location to be at Hokkaido Komamae Town.\nThanks to all this information, the police helicopter locates Takagi, with less than a minute to spare. Sato flies down from it, uses her police gun to cut the noose around Takagi's neck, then tackles Takagi to the nearby ground before the bomb sets off. They fall in a safe spot as the bomb explodes in the air. For the first time, Sato calls Takagi, \"Wataru\" and then she passionately kisses him, much to the dismay of the Tokyo policemen.\nFuemoto's other reason to pull this plan was that he was dying of cancer, therefore he didn't want to kick it before \"punishing\" whoever caused the death of his surrogate daughter Natalie. It also turns out that Natalie had never thought that she had been dumped by Date: she was among the persons who identified his corpse after the accident, and commited suicide for the grief of losing her boyfriend right before officially getting engaged.\nDespite Sato trying to assure Takagi that Natalie's death was not his fault, he does feel guilty for not giving her the ring, that was hidden in Date's old notebook, believing that it had been Date's last wish when he entrusted Takagi the notebook on his deathbed.\n",
