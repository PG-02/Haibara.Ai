    "Situation": "Due to a recent fad, Sakamoto Ryoma histories have become popular. Capitalizing on this, Jirokichi Suzuki's museum has set up a Ryoma exhibit. Jirokichi wanted to purchase a prize item of Ryoma's for the exhibit, a gun belt with a large ruby, from the current owners Shishihiko Tarumi and Masanosuke Hanamura. Not wanting to buy it before having it evaluated by his own appraiser, Jirokichi instead arranged a space at the exhibit for the owners to display the gunbelt in the meanwhile. Elsewhere, Sonoko tells Ran that Kaitou Kid has sent an advance notice that he will be at the exhibit to return some items that were stolen 20 years ago from Shishihiko Tarumi's Ryoma exhibit by the thief Phantom Lady: Ryoma's letter to his wife talking about the belt, a pistol Ryoma carried, and a sake cup with a bloodstain from when Ryoma was assassinated. Inspector Ginzo Nakamori and Superintendent Shintaro Chaki discuss the best strategy to capture Kid: lure Kid in to allow him to to return what was stolen, but then prevent him from leaving.\nOn the day of the heist, Conan is confronted by Kid in the bathroom stalls who reveals he was able to bypass the metal detectors by removing the lead from the pistol. As Kid leaves, Conan overhears Tarumi and his appraiser hoping Kid succeeds in his plot. Kid appears at the announced time and publicly claims he is cleaning up before setting off the fire sprinklers; he blends into the crowd who are also soaked from the rain and makes his escape.\n",
    "People": "- 58 years old\n- Ryoma exhibition organizer\n- 63 years old\n- Appraiser\n- Mysterious thief\n- Nakamori's subordinate\n- Exhibit guest\n",
    "Resolution": "The water washes off the description plates in the museum revealing messages from Kid detailing the items in the Ryoma exhibition are fake and how Tarumi had been creating forgeries and selling them to the black market. This is confirmed when they discover many identical copies of the letter, cup, and pistol returned by Kid. As evidence, the blood on the cup is revealed to belong to Tarumi's appraiser and partner in crime. Conan, after deducing Kid would be disguised as an obese man due to the number of objects he would be carrying, confronts him and lets him leave crediting it as a favor to Ryoma, because his mother was a fan. Kaito's response is \"not being able to face your mother, I can relate\"  which hints that the Phantom Lady is Kaitou's mother.\n",
    "Trivia": "- These are the first episodes to use the new updated character designs by Masatomo Sudo and Seiji Muta.\n- Starting from these episodes, the anime was produced by V1 Studio, one of TMS Entertainment production studios.\n",
