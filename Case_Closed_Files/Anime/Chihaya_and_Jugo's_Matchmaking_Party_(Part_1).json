    "Situation": "Kogoro is surprised as the restaurant where they’re going to eat at is currently full due to the ongoing matchmaking party, so they have to find another restaurant, not knowing that Kogoro has dropped his keys while taking the phone (there’s also sound for us to confirm this).\nMeanwhile, in the said restaurant, Jugo Yokomizo is seen complaining about his family rushing him to get married, though he’s still enjoying the drink there and assuming that no one would recognize him. Ironically, Chihaya is there and immediately recognizes him while he can’t, so she has to take off the mask not knowing the rule of the party thus making Anju Tomari jealouses. As it turns out, Chihaya comes to the event with her friend, Shinobu Ooe, due to the party being free for women while costing 10.000 yen for men.\nThe latter also notices Jugo’s pants being wet, he explains that it was because the rain makes the steps outside slippery, causing him and some others who talk to him later to fall. The matchmaking party officially begins! Firstly, women will sit at the chair with their respective number while men will split into groups and sit with ladies’ for a small period of time, and for an unexpected turn, Jugo gets to sit with Chihaya. Chihaya begins first by asking the case which is currently in charged, he answers it a bit until he notices that this is a matchmaking party so people would ask about others’ lover’s taste; so Chihaya describes it as: foul-mouthed, arrogant, always rushing into things regardless of the consequences – a true daredevil and mentions about a man like that used to fall for her who appear for us to be Matsuda. But a man named Itaru Kaburagi, who shares the table with the two, interrupts their conversation as for him, they appears to know each other already so it’s his turn, but it does not go out too well for him as Chihaya’s answers to all of his question are motorbike.\nLater, Chihaya and Ooe decide to have a buffet even though there are many people waiting to have a talk with the sooner as they just want to eat to feel deserving of the money. Jugo is surprised as the party is free in charge for women, with Chihaya explaining that she carried Ooe on her vehicle, so it’s still a thing. The time for the free talking has ended and they have to write five most interesting people on a paper and give it to the staff but Jugo forgets Chihaya’s number. Later on, the MC reveals that they have arranged so that the two most interested women can have more time to talk with others, and Juzo luckily manages to be in the list.\nOn to Mouri’s family, Kogoro realizes that his keys are lost, which Conan suggests that they should go back to the restaurant where they left earlier. In the meantime, Jugo wonders whether he has to talk with Tomari or if Chihaya would go with another man and speak ill about him. But before he has a chance to talk with her, he finds her dead with a gunshot wound in the chest, the woman standing outside with him also screams, which catches Mouri’s family’s attention when they have just found the keys. Conan quickly goes to the place where the scream comes from, with Kogoro and Ran following behind, and tells the man who he does not recognize as Jugo Yokomizo not to touch the body, which surprised both of the two. The group also meets up with Chihaya, whom they met in a past case.\n\nThe police arrive at the scene, it’s easily concluded that the suspects are the three who have gone in the room to talk with the victim, so they begin questioning the suspects following the order: The first one is Kaburagi, an IT company director; the next one is Ikuhisa Uedera, unemployed but his family is rich; and finally, Genji Enzaki, a literary critic. But the interrogation is interrupted as Conan discovers traces of confettis under the table where the victim sat, which implies that someone must have been hiding under the table before killing her as there are lots of confettis in the hallway where Conan went to the scene. And this argument is further improved as: there is one additional bullet hole differ from the one that killed the victim in the wall, meaning that the culprit must have shot once to warn her; beside that, everyone does not come out from the room in which they come in so no one would suspect when the time end.\nThe police begin asking the suspects again: Kaburagi states that she looked haggard and kept acting suspicious during their conversation, at first he thought that she ate something bad leading to stomach-ache, but it now feels like that she’d felt that someone would kill her, he also admits to be nice to women, which is later confirmed in her letter about first impression; next one is Enzaki, he states that she seemed to be disappointed about him after taking the mask off, nonetheless, the two still talking and Tomari’s impression was that he is funny; finally is Enzaki, her impression for him was well-educated; all of which are heard by Conan through through the bug installed on Kogoro’s bag.\nSuddenly, Conan notices one Employee who looks panicked as one guest broke a glass when the murder happened, with another one suggesting taking a broom to collect it. The interrogation did not go well as people who talked with Chihaya were stunned by her cold’s word so they couldn’t recall a thing for now. Later, Conan gets to see Tomari’s impression letter which Takagi regrets letting him see this kind of stuff, with Conan seeming to know the truth behind this murder. However, when Jugo is looking for Chihaya, he slips and almost has critical injury due to the aforementioned broken glass, Takagi steps on the glass to save him, luckily. This also reminds her about Matsuda acting recklessly without knowing the consequences.\nWhen everyone gathers, Jugo is surprised as to the reason why Chihaya chose those people was just to have a feast while denying his invitation to eat. Finally, Sleeping Kogoro can begin his deduction about the case.\n",

    "Resolution": "Chihaya, after seeing Takagi's actions, grabs his tie and begins to question him about his reckless disregard for the consequences, to which he replies that it was only occasionally while recalling many times like that. Chihaya exclaims that he seems like some fool who wanted to die alone, with Sato interfering her as his girlfriend, at which point Chihaya tells Sato not to let him go because people like him are hard to find and asks Jugo to drive her home since she had a bit too much to drink. She bids Conan farewell and went home with Jugo.\nLater, Chihaya shares Jugo the time when Shinobu Ooe attempted suicide when her boyfriend broke her, only to be stopped by Matsuda by a similar fashion to Takagi. Chihaya then asked him why he hold the knife blade, he then explained that looking at the blood and people will see that they would do a horrible thing when attempted suicide. However, the conversation is interrupted when she sees Jugo’s blood, in which he explains that he had encountered a murder who’s also a thief and got hurt from that; and the move he used to knock out Kaburagi might have made the wound open again (and it’s bleeding we suppose), but he states that he should be fine. Chihaya states in her mind that another reckless fool here.\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- Some original scenes and dialogues are added:\n- Kogoro realizes that he lost the key and might lose it in front of the restaurant.\n- Jugo imagines that Chihaya picks a man for dinner before shaking his head off.\n- Conan asks Jugo not to touch the body (because he does not know that the man in the mask is Jugo).\n- Takagi is doing a hand pose after Jugo did Western Lariat to the culprit.\n- Chihaya walked away with Jugo after talking to Conan while ensuring Jugo did not become grouchy after she asked for a ride home.\n- Some background scenes are not adapted:\n- Jugo when he thinks Kaburagi also slipped at the entrance.\n- Woman staff when she tells Jugo about the incident that happened at the previous matchmaking party.\n- Sango appears in the background both in manga and anime, but on different occasions:\n- In the manga, he appears when Jugo mentions his fancy shoes.\n- In anime, he appeared when Jugo thought about Sango and kept introducing him to his colleagues.\n- In the manga, Conan eavesdropping on the suspect's questioning is only shown at the end during Enzaki's turn. In the anime, it is shown since Kaburagi's turn.\n- The events after Jugo slips are changed in the anime, where the staff only appears to clean the glass shards after Chihaya remarks that Takagi is just like Jinpei. In the manga, the staff showed up immediately before Sato asked Takagi about his foot.\n- The scene and dialogue when two staffs pushing the food trolley is changed. In the manga, the male staff asked the female staff to return it as dinner was canceled. In the anime, the staff are both female, and one of them commented that the dinner is wasted.\n- In the manga, when Kaburagi took the knife from the trolley, the food cover opened, and the food was shown. It remained closed in the anime.\n",
