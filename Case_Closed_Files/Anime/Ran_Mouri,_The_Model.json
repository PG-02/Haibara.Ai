    "Situation": "Ran is scouted as a model for a painting by Ryuji Kasuga. That day, Conan accompany Ran because he is worried. Later, he senses something from the garden. While he is investigating, he meets the gardener, who mentioned that something has happened with two previous models.\n\n\nBoth models were pushed around the same place where Kasuga scouted them, and they admit that they saw Kasuga on the day of incident. Machiko recalls that she heard a clattering sound.\nMeanwhile, Yoshio is searching something in Kasuga's late wife's room, and he finds some photos of Kasuga and his wife taken at some specific places. At the same time, Kasuga is finishing Ran's potrait painting.\nConan then tells Kogoro that the garderner revealed that Kasuga's wife passed away six months ago and he was depressed and could not enter his studio. After a while, he found some models and start painting, but both models end up being attacked by someone on their way home on the day the painting was finished. After hearing that, they quickly run to Kasuga's house.\n",
    "People": "- 30 years old\n- Artist\n- 28 years old\n- Kasuga's assistant and manager\n- 24 years old\n- Kasuga's apprentice\n- Victim (fell - injured)\n- 22 years old\n- Kasuga's former model\n- Victim (car hit - injured)\n- 19 years old\n- Kasuga's former model\n- Kasuga's house gardener\n- Deceased (accident)\n- Kasuga's wife\n",
    "Resolution": "\nFortunately, Kogoro and Conan arrive in time to stop him. Conan tranquillizes Kogoro and starts the deduction to solve this case.\nKomiyama believed that the attacks were executed by Kasuga because they happened near the studio in deserted locations, which means the culprit probably was following the victims and he deduced that the culprit was someone from the studio. Kogoro says that his affirmations are correct but the culprit isn't Kasuga, but the assistant, Riko Rokui. Conan via Kogoro continues explaining the pieces of evidence that she is the culprit.\nFirst, the second victim heard a sound before being attacked, which sounded like a clattering sound which was revealed to have come from sketching pencils. Kasuga doesn't carry anything, but his assistant carries those all the time. Second, there's a scratch at the staircase's poles where the first victim was pushed. This means Riko grabbed the pole when she tried to push the victim and the scratch was made from her wristwatch.\nLastly, he says that a part of her wristwatch's metal band is shaped differently and looks new, so it probably was repaired in a hurry after it got damaged. All they have to do is ask the store where she had her watch repaired and that would get them the evidence they need. She then confesses that she did the attacks because she hated the models, she was a big fan of Kasuga’s and he asked her to be his assistant, but the happiness of being his assistant was ruined when he scouted new models.\n\nConan is startled and worried about Ran when Riko grabs a knife and tries to attack Ran but is relieved when she stops it with a karate kick. Ran reveals that Kasuga told her that she is his last model because he would like to return to work with Riko. Riko realizing that she had misunderstood and had made a terrible mistake breaks down into tears.\n",
    "Trivia": "- There is a continuity error near the beginning of the episode after the opening. The door handle on the room Komiyama enters after his introduction changes from the right side to the left side when Kasuga goes to check on him shortly after.\n"
