    "Situation": "Kogoro, Ran, and Conan attend a professional wrestling match at the Tohto Sumo Stadium, where a wrestler challenges the legendary wrestler (IWGP Junior Heavyweight) Wolf Face. However, before the match begins, Wolf Face's challenger, Hyota Nagase, is found dead in the waiting room by his staff.\n\nA secret video camera reveals that a man wearing Wolf Face's mask murdered Hyota. Four wrestlers who have the same body structure as Wolf Face are gathered and interrogated by the police.\nAfter re-watching the murder on the camera, Conan realizes how they will find the murderer.\n",
    "People": "- 27 years old\n- Teito Pro Wrestlers member (Wolf Face)\n- Victim (stabbed)\n- 25 years old\n- Teito Pro Wrestlers member\n- 36 years old\n- Teito Pro Wrestlers member\n- 25 years old\n- Teito Pro Wrestlers member\n- 30 years old\n- Teito Pro Wrestlers Italian member (Nega-Wolf)\n- Teito Pro Wrestlers captain\n- Teito Pro Wrestlers manager\n- Real-life pro wrestler\n- Real-life pro wrestlers\n",
    "Resolution": "Ushigome confesses and reveals that Nagase was trying to take them down and move to Bankoku pro wrestling, he was the one supposed to unmask Ogami and he's the one who want to steal his mask. Then, Ushigome goes on a rampage, incapacitating Megure and Takagi.\n\nHe knocks out the other wrestlers easily, and reveals that he want to pin the crime on Ogami so he can become Wolf Face. Conan told him that the mask would not cover his guilt. This only makes Ushigome angrier, and he nearly chokes Conan to death, but he was incapcitated by Ran's \"Shining Wizard\", a Keiji Mutoh's attack very similar to the word \"dying message\".\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In the manga, when Ushigome was choking Conan, he had him pinned to the ground rather than in air like in the anime.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The case characters have names related to wild animals: Ogami comes from \"Okami\" (Wolf); Kiba and Leonardo mean \"Fang\" and \"strong as a Lion\"; Hyouta, Ushigome, Sakuma, and Kayama contain the kanjis for Leopard, Cattle, Bear, and Deer. Moreover, the origin of Kiba's name is from the real-life Japanese professional wrestlers Antonio Inoki and Giant Baba, and the appearance is modeled after Inoki.[1]\n- Conan compares Ogami's relation with his girlfriend to his own with Ran, as both have to hide their faces to their partners while being next to them.\n",
