    "Situation": "Heiji was invited to go to a real demon dog extermination, and invites Conan, Kogoro, and Ran to come with him and Kazuha.\nFive years ago, the womanizing chairman of the Inubushi group, Tsunechika Inubushi, died of terminal cancer. Due to his past habits, several people appeared, claiming to be related to Inubushi by presenting a picture of their mother with the president. Without the president or their mothers to confirm whether the claims were true or not, it became impossible to confirm or deny their claims. Regardless, the president's wife took in all eight people as her own adopted children. And now, with the president's wife ill herself, the inheritance is to be divided amongst the eight children.\nHowever, two out of eight died in strange ways recently. One fell off a cliff, and just before dying claimed that a fiery monster had assaulted him prior to the fall. Another had been assaulted by a dog on fire.\nHeiji and Conan head to the apartment of Shinichi Kudo (one of the adopted children, who, after learning about the two deaths, decided that his life was more important than the inheritance and thus left the Inubushis), but end up unable to meet with him because he is asleep. Thirty minutes later, they return to his room upon hearing a musical timer supposedly meant to wake him up, only to find his door sealed and Shinichi dead.\n\n",
    "People": "- Deceased\n- Inubushi Group president\n- 39 years old\n- Home helper\n- Victim (poison)\n- 43 years old\n- Adopted son of Inubushi\n- Fish store clerk\n- Tokyo MPD CSI officer\n",
    "Resolution": "- The books stacked near the window (serving as a makeshift footstool) in a room of a man with a bad back.\n- The charcoal wasn't hot even when held, indicating that it had already finished burning a while ago.\n- The set-up would have logically taken longer than the thirty minutes.\n- The jaw had already began to stiffen, indicating that the man had been dead for longer than an hour.\n- A picture of Abukawa's son was found inside the wardrobe door, and the culprit insisted Abukawa follow their orders lest her son meet the same fate as Kudo.\nAbukawa breaks down, claiming that Kudo was already dead by the time she came in the afternoon. Abukawa had answered the phone and heard a voice telling to her that she'd better hurry and save Kudo, locked in the wardrobe in his room. She did so, only to find the dead Kudo and a picture of her son. Shortly later, the mysterious person claiming to be a vengeful spirit called back to threaten Fubukawa into cooperating.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The episode was scheduled to be aired on March 19, 2011. However, due to 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, it was postponed to April 9, 2011.\n- \"Inubushi\" is the romanization of \"犬伏\", a real Japanese surname. The first character literally means \"dog\", and the second contains the character \"犬\", and (at least in Chinese) is a verb meaning \"to lie down\" or \"to infiltrate (the enemy ranks and wait for a good opportunity to do damage)\". The second meaning is similar to the victim's belief that one of the adopted children is not from the Inubushi family and infiltrates so that when there is a suitable opportunity he or she can kill the Inubushis off.\n"
