    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "The Detective Boys attend an animal show starring a white lion named Leon. Outside, a man named James Black, is mistaken by reporters for Randy Hawk, a rich man who sponsors zoos and animal shows. The Detective Boys lead him out of the crowd of reporters by pretending he is their English teacher after Conan realizes that his accent is British by the way James says \"can\". Professor Agasa reveals that Randy Hawk has a Southern accent. In return for their help, James offers to treat them to lunch and leaves to get his car only to be mistaken for Hawks and kidnapped for ransom.\n\nGrowing concerned, the Detective Boys search for James. Their investigation leads them to believe he was kidnapped. They find James' strap from the animal show in an alley way and discover blood on the letters P, &, A on the strap.\nAyumi notices that James Black still has her Detective Badge, allowing Conan to trace the signal and have Sato set up a road block intercepting the vehicle. The kidnappers manage to elude the road block since their vehicle is disguised as a police car.\n",
    "People": "- Animal show sponsor\n- Randy's first son\n- Paul & Annie animal show member\n- Randy's second daughter\n- Paul & Annie animal show member\n- Fake police officer\n- Fake police officer\n- Fake police officer\n- Saitama Prefecture Police\n- Saitama Prefecture Police\n- Reporter\n- Neighborhood kid\n- Tokyo MPD Police sergeant\n",
    "Resolution": "",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- The animal show is a bit longer in the anime with it starting of with a clown, bear, elephants and horses. Also, the manga starts with showing the exterior of the building, while the anime doesn't.\n- The anime extends the scene where the kids going by as James Black is kidnapped as they observe the event.\n",
    "Remastered version": "- A remastered version of this case was aired on April 5, 2014 (Part 1) and April 12, 2014 (Part 2).\n",
    "Trivia": "- Continuity error: After Conan walks toward James Black in order to take him away from the crowd of mistaken reporters, the anime switches to showing Haibara. In this switch, Conan's hair is seen to the left of Haibara, which is where Conan was standing previously. However, Conan shouldn't have been standing there as he had already walked away from that position, and thus, his hair should not have been there either.\n- In the second part of the case, the opening was changed to Winter Bells.\n- The fake police car is a 1989 Nissan Skyline Keisatsu [R32].\n- The six police cars that followed the fake police car are a 2001 Daihatsu Mira [L700S] (Yumi's car), a 1991 Toyota Crown [S140] (white & gray police cars), and two Nissan Skylines [R32].\n",
