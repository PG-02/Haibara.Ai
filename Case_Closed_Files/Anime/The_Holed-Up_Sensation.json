    "Situation": "On a Friday afternoon, everything seemed to progress just as an ordinary Friday would; however, among a certain street, things had become exceedingly intense and imminent: all pedestrians were startled and ceased their movements as a result, gaping their mouths with utter astonishments afterwards. Obviously, all of their focus was completely taken away by a young man - Yuichi Beppu. He abruptly showed up with a gun in his hand, urging all of the pedestrians, in his perspective, obstacles, to drive away as he advanced in the middle of that street. All of the people went into panic hysterically and fled at their maximum velocity. The guy shouted. He glanced over the street. Immediately, he saw another pedestrian who was stunned but did not realise the severeness of the situation. The guy grabbed her by the neck. He escorted her fiercely into a nearby residence at random, which also happened to be an empty one with the door lock unlocked, and in turn kidnapped her rapidly without any negligence.\nBeppu closed the door to that residence. He darted through the staircases perceptively. He swiftly managed to open the huge window to the veranda of the second floor... The police had arrived... All media agencies liaised with each other, recording this dramatic scenario happening on this not-so-peaceful Friday afternoon. Beppu claimed himself as \"Culprit X\" and would kidnap the girl he had just grabbed randomly from the street. He chortled defiantly like a maniac.\n\nThe size of this commotion had increased significantly in terms of its affectiveness and attractiveness. Kogoro and Conan saw this incident broadcast on the TV and arrived there to do some watchout; staff from Nichiuri TV were deployed with helicopters to observe the situation; Inspector Megure, along with the personnel from Tokyo Police Division 1, were on standby and served as the contact person with the kidnapper Neppu. The kinapper Beppu had taken quite violent action on the veranda - he was threatening the Tokyo Police regarding the hostage, saying that if he got incensed, he would end the life of that girl effortlessly. This made Inspector Megure rather anxious; he emphasised to Beppu that he ought not to harm the hostage.\nOn the other hand, Beppu had given out some terms he wanted to fulfill in order to keep the hostage safe: firstly, a gold player named Yumura Nichiuri must hit ten home runs during the game tonight; secondly, the manufacturer of the \"Yaiba Chocoloate\" must increment the number of cards that come in each chololate package from one to one hundred. Having these statements declared, everyone was petrified in a confounded manner, as this is definitely not what they would expect a kidnapper to say.\n\"This is ridiculous,\" Takagi remarked. Beppu smirked grandly in triumph. At this instance, a middle-aged man turned up; he is named Shosuke Kusatsu. He told Megure that the house where the kidnaper holed up himself along with the hostage was originally his house, yet he moved away some days ago. Hence, the house was on its way of being demolished. Beppu overheard their conversation and cackled even more. He took the hostage with him inside and closed the window door to the veranda malevolently. Just as Kogoro and Megure were at a loss for dealing with the kidnapper, they heard a sharp and rowdy noise -  it was patently the sound of a gun being fired. Pow! Pow! Immaculately two shots. All pedestrians were appaled. Inspector Megure began to scream, \"What did you do, Culprit X?\" But no response came from the building. Therefore, the police decided to break into the house forcibly...\n... as they arrived in at the second floor of the building, they were all astounded by what they had seen in front of them - two restful dead bodies lying neatly over the tatami mat, out of breath and with no sign of vitality. How come both of them get killed?\n\nBy checking the licences in their belongings, the police quickly identified the identities of the two victims but also discovered a shocking truth: the addresses on both licences were the same! What did that imply? They were living together, simply. Knowing this information, Conan surmised that they were most likely just executing an act in the public, one of the would be pretending to be the hostage, and the other one, evidently, would be acting the kidnapper role. This may also match with the suicide note remained at the crime scene: a joke after all.\nAn acquaintance of the vitcims, Tsutomu Kinugawa, thus visited the building at this moment. He claimed that he only knew this after seeing the news air on the TV. He then disclosed some useful clues to the police:\n- Few days ago, Beppu told him that \"something\" astonishing would happen during the weekend (might be referring to this Friday afternoon)\n- In Kingawa's conjecture, Beppu had most likely made a bet with someone else\n- Beppu also had recounted a joke pertaining to \"making a fortune by carrying out a ludicrous joke\"\nBased on these information, Takagi speculated that Beppu intended to implement a \"funny\" joke towards the public (can tell by looking at those non-sense terms he offered) by faking an abduction with his wife; by doing this, he could force the golf game and in turn, alter the resolution of the scores. This aided him in winning the bet he made; however, he quickly realised that he overcommitted too much, leading to the situation becoming fairly austere. Not withstanding the huge pressure, the two of them committing suicide seemed to be the only way to play this farce off.\nThe police's deduction did seem somewhat justifiable and consistent with the clues left at the crime scene. Nonetheless, Conan was not convinced at all. He instigated Kogoro to extend the investigation further. The following day, they consulted the landlady at a club where Beppu and Arima frequently stopped their footsteps. Effectively, they learned the fact that Beppu stole Arima from her ex, and this made Kogoro relate to the motive behind this intriguing case. They also got to know that Beppu and Arima worked together to deceive many people, resulting in the victims who suffered from their scams being pervasive and ubiquitous. Recently, a brand-new victim had emerged, whose name is Mitsusada Dogo.\nThinking that visiting this victim, Dogo's house, might usher them towards the elusive and luscious truth of this case, they visited his residence right away. Dogo assuredly was a rather aged pensioner who had just been discouraged by the couple. He began to recount what happened: six months ago, Arima acted exceedingly helpless and was grieved to a great extent about not turning over her finance well; not concealing his kind-hearts, Dogo helped her out anyhow. Yet the truth turned out to be a swindle set up by her and her boyfriend, Beppu. Having to keep in mind that Dogo might serve as an eligible candidate for murder, Kogoro inquired of him for an alibi; Dogo responded to him that he was solely watching TV yesterday afternoon, which was precisely when that ridiculous kidnapping took place. He then expressed his joy over the deaths of the couple.\nStumbled within the conundrum, Kogoro and Conan left Dogo and walked down the street of Beika, simultaneously making an effort to attain a plausible justification for the case. Conan then bumped into a witness nearby who claimed to be at the crime scene that day. He disclosed that a strange perception was bothering him at the outset: the kidnapper (Beppu) explicitly entered Kusatsu's abandoned house with no hesitation and accurately evaded entering those occupied ones. How fishy was that? Was it a coincidence after all?\nThey then realised that Arima's ex was in fact Kinugawa and thought the motive could be firmly established; as a result, they met Kinugawa in front of a supermarket and began questioning him. Kogoro started his \"accusation\" appropriately: he vaguely explained the reason why Kinugawa showed up at the crime scene yesterday - it was to mislead the police with fake information, since he could bring up the \"debt theorem\" about how Beppu was engaged with a third person on a debt, so he had to execute this vexatious kidnapping. This, in turn, would eliminate all of the suspicions against him, and the police would divert their investigation direction onto that fabricated \"debt loser.\" However, this did not solve the problem, but even worsened the situation; Kinugawa got somewhat enraged and snapped at Kogoro, claiming that everything he offered was true and told from Beppu's mouth. In addition to that, he also had an alibi during the murder - he was talking to a police officer at that time.\nKogoro's vanity was bashed by the preceding words uttered by Kinugawa. Kogoro and Conan proceeded their walking whereupon. At one instant, a luminous flash pierced through Conan's head - Eureka! He had figured out the culprit, along with the gimmick utilised. They immediately reached out to Kusatsu, the empty house owner, and explained the situation. Conan successfully borrowed the spare key to that empty house from him; despite the fact that the empty house would get demolished really soon. Knowing that a few seconds of procrastination would mess up the entire matter, Conan dashed towards the empty house at his maximum velocity. He checked a few things within the house and impeded the demolition to retain evidence. He then liaised with the police and case related personnel at this almost-demolished house - obviously for truth revelation.\n",

    "Resolution": "",
    "The Truth Behind the Fake Suicides": "Kogoro, without being asleep, states that the culprit is Mr. Dogo, who entered using a spare key after Beppu distracting the police. He states that he only came when the hostage situation appeared on TV. Kogoro, without any words left, is finally asleep by Conan, who starts a real deduction. He didn't enter the house when the commotion on TV was broadcast, but even before that: at thursday morning, when he heard about how his friend Kusatsu was planning to demolish his old house, he decided to kill the pair on friday, a day before the demolition, as if there was any evidence, it wouldn't matter as the scene would be demolished. He appeared days before and told Beppu his idea to stage a hostage situation and cause commotion, but only as a joke, and telling him that even if he got into law troubles with the police, he will hire a good lawyer for him. Then, used the spare key to enter the house in the morning, and hid in the room attic. Beppu then would take his fake hostage Yayoi Arima, his partner, and bring her to the room, creating a locked room situation.\nWhile Beppu was making his silly demands, Dogo knocked Arima out, and when Beppu returned to the room, he was also knocked out. Then, he killed them both with the gun Beppu had that he gave him. Finally, Dogo returned to the attic and hid there, even during the police investigation, meaning that the culprit was above their heads, and finally fleeing at night, meaning that he spent almost 20 hours in this plan. He revealed to know about the cursed bet, even if they never made the information public, he probably heard that from the attic. Another evidence are hair traces found in the attic, that if compared to his hair, it'll prove his guiltiness in the murder.\nNow, they are sure that Mitsusada Dogo is the culprit behind this case.\n",
    "The Motive": "He finally confesses that 6 months ago a punk was bothering him in public, but Yayoi Arima chased him off. He started to trust her thinkng she was a nice girl, and when he found out she had money problems, he started to help her, thinking that it was good how he could still be useful to someone, but it was all a lie: Yayoi's partner was none other than the punk who bothered him 6 months ago, Yuichi Beppu. He became insanely enraged about how they used him as a joke, and finally created the murder plan, thinking that killing them wasn't enough, thus taking advantage about the abandoned house and the hostage situation; he is eventually arrested.\n",
