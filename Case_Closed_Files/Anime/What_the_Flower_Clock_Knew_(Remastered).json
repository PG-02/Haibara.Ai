    "Situation": "Due to being chosen to participate as a baton twirler during the Grand Opening of the Beika Park's Flower Clock, Ayumi has been practicing her moves in front of the clock every morning. When she invites Conan and the others to watch, they witness a drunk man wandering around and generally being a nuisance. The next morning, the man is found dead, his head smashed on the stone number 6.\n\nDuring the investigation, the drunk man is revealed to be a local painter and a heavy boozer, Shousaku Yoda. He also knew a man with a grudge, Kyouichirou Kawaguchi. He claimed that the victim killed his girlfriend, and clearly stated he holds a grudge, but he also has an alibi.\n",
    "People": "- Victim (bludgeoned)\n- Painter\n- Kojima Liquors' client\n- 30 years old\n- Physical education instructor\n- Security guard\n- Yoneda painting factory owner\n- Shousaku's boss\n- Deceased (car accident)\n- Kyouichirou's past girlfriend\n",
    "Resolution": "The proof is the blood on the stone next to the #12 and the dying message in the utility room, clearly identifying Kyouichirou Kawaguchi as the culprit. Seeing all this evidence he breaks down in disbelief as he throws a fit stating that he thought his plan was foolproof.\n",
