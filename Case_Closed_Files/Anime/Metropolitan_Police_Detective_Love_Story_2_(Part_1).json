    "Situation": "Sato is chasing a man named Higashida through the school building where the Detective Boys are in. The man is a murder suspect in the murder of his boss, in whose apartment he was found. After cornering him, she accidentally handcuffs him to her between a toilet handle, trapping them. The man proclaims he is innocent and that needs to get on a plane tomorrow to attend his daughter's wedding. She tells Takagi to solve the case before the time and not to inform the police. The Tokyo police department send out a massive manhunt for the suspect, Sato, and Takagi.\n\nTakagi and the Detective Boys discover the secret as to why Higashida was in Muranishi room.\n",
    "People": "- Company employee\n- Victim (strangled)\n- Higashida and Kitagawa's boss\n- Company employee\n- Tokyo MPD police officer\n- Tokyo MPD police officer\n- Masami's building manager\n- Demolition worker\n- Bartender\n- Higashida's daughter\n- Hanaka's husband\n- Higashida's son-in-law\n",
    "Resolution": "To do the trick, he first bought grey curtains and bed covers, removed the calendar, and put the cactus tree outside. He took things that are too risky to be caught out, changed the bed covers and curtains, and rearranged the furniture so that it looks like Higashida's room. After he killed Muranishi, he drunken Higashida and brought him back to Muranishi's room, thinking he's at his own room. He then called Higashida up, still drunk, to come and chain the door. After Higashida opened the door and Kitagawa checked everything, Higashida locked the door and went back to sleep. That's why the next day, Higashida was found sleeping on Muranishi's bed with dead body. As for the fingerprints, Kitagawa borrowed Higashida's AV cable to use for the murder and frame him. Since he has a pinch mark on his thumb and a bloodstain was found on the cactus, the police can compare it and use it for evidence. He is soon arrested.\n",
    "Trivia": "- This is the last episode where Kaneto Shiozawa voiced Ninzaburo Shiratori, as he passed away on May 10, 2000.\n- As most of the police force is heading to the building, the bicycle police were going faster than the cars, which would be impossible.\n- The Police Team Vehicles are Honda VFR 750 P, Mitsubishi Fuso F-3 [T-370] & 1989 Nissan Skyline Keisatsu [R32].\n",
