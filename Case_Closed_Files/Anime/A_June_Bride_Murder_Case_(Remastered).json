    "Case": "",
    "Situation": "Conan, Ran, and Sonoko visit their old middle school music teacher, Sayuri Matsumoto, as she prepares for her wedding to Toshihiko Takasugi. Sayuri teases Conan because he reminds her of a boy she once taught. Conan manages to escape suspicion before too many parallels to Shinichi are noticed.\nNot everyone seems to be completely satisfied with Sayuri's marriage choice: a former student with a crush, Sayuri's doubting police father, and the groom's ex-girlfriend are all present. As Sonoko films the proceedings, Sayuri drinks from a can of her favorite lemon tea. She then collapses and is rushed to the hospital. The tea was spiked with a caustic substance.\n\n",
    "People": "- Victim (poison - injured)\n- 27 years old\n- Bride\n- Teitan Junior High music teacher\n- Kiyonaga's daughter\n- 27 years old\n- Sayuri's college friend\n- Toshihiko's ex-girlfriend\n- 54 years old\n- Tokyo MPD superintendent\n- Sayuri's father\n- 18 years old\n- Sayuri's former student\n- Former Teitan Junior High council president\n- 28 years old\n- Groom\n- Takasugi Group heir\n- Policeman from Tokyo Police District\n",
    "Resolution": "- By looking at the video Ran took he showed that Sonoko had put her lemon tea right next to the victim's and the criminal had put the poison in Sonoko's lemon tea instead of the one the victim had been drinking. Proof of this was the fact that Sonoko's fingerprints were all over the can and two of the people that had touched the can did have their fingerprints on it.\n- The criminal had actually put in the capsule they brought along with the poison, floating in the drink and with the poison that was put in separately to make it look like the poison was put in 15 minutes before when it actually had been put in more recently.\n- The only four people that had been near the can after it was switched was Sonoko, Ran, Conan, and the groom, Toshihiko Takasugi.\nThe criminal was Toshihiko Takasugi. Sonoko and Ran had never touched the can after the switch and once they exclude Conan, Takasugi and the victim herself are the only people that could of poisoned the lemon tea. It couldn't have been the victim because there was no container to hold the poison in or the drying agent. Those two things were needed to carry around sodium hydroxide, the poison used, because sodium hydroxide liquefies in a few minutes and the victim was in the room the whole time there would be no way to dispose of the container and drying agent outside in the hall where it was found.\nThe motive was that superintendent Matsumoto had crashed into a suspect's car twelve years ago, and Takasugi's mother and only direct relative got caught in the crash.\n\n- Deceased (car crash)\n- Toshihiko's mother\n- Candy shop owner\n- Criminal twenty years ago\nNot seeing Takasugi's mother, Matsumoto told him to go away when he tried to tell him. 15 minutes later Takasugi's mother died on the street. Upon hearing this, Matsumoto admitted his share of guilt in the accident, but also added that once he learned about Takasugi's mother, he never forgave himself for inadvertently killing her. He did intend to apologize to Takasugi, but he had already moved away by then.\nTakasugi was adopted by a rich family, and then destiny brought him back to Matsumoto and Sayuri. When he learned that his girlfriend was the superintendent's daughter, he was consumed by anger and bitterness, wanted to kill her to show the superintendent how much it hurt to lose someone he cared for. Kazumi Takenaka, however, slapped Takasugi and told him that Sayuri's first love was a boy who loved Lemon Tea and never forgot him after he moved away for undisclosed reasons. Once Sayuri started dating Takasugi and noticed he also drank Lemon Tea, she deduced what had happened in the past, therefore she did know that Takasugi was her lost first love, knew what he wanted to do to her, and willingly took the poison to atone for all the pain that transformed Takasugi from a kind boy to an embittered adult.\n",

    "Anime": "- The names of the characters in the Funimation Dub are:\n- Sayuri Matsumoto - Catherine McLaughlin\n- Kazumi Takenaka - Celia\n- Atsushi Umemiya - Johnny Umina\n- Toshihiko Takasugi - Tony Tsugi\n",
    "Manga to anime changes": "- In anime, Kazumi only bought two cans of lemon tea. In the manga, there were also a can of coffee and a can of oolong tea. Ran took the coffee while Conan took the oolong tea.\n- Details about Umemiya being former council president and the fact that he performed on graduation day is not mentioned by Sonoko in anime version.\n- In manga, Conan had to ask the police officer where he found the glass bottle containing the desiccant. In anime, the police officer directly reports the location to Megure.\n- Several scenes not adapated into the anime:\n- Conan directly asked Ran to call an ambulance, before proceeded to examine Sayuri's condition. He then deduced that the poison was sodium hydroxide. He first used oolong tea to rinse out Sayuri's mouth in an effort to neutralize the poison in her body, but did not work, so he used the milk Ran bought. It is later stated that this bit of first aid may have been the reason to why Sayuri was discharged from the hospital sooner than anticipated.\n- Every suspects' initial reaction when they heard that Sayuri collapsed.\n- Superintendant Matsumoto stopped Takasugi, Sonoko, and Ran who want to ride the ambulance. Takasugi then asked Matsumoto if he should worry more about her daughter, which made Matsumoto have suspicion towards Takasugi.\n",
