    "Situation": "Conan and the Detective Boys are watching a soccer game when someone calls the television station covering the game. This person demands that 50 million yen be given to him, or he will indiscriminately shoot someone in the stands.\n\nWhen the money is being picked up, the police attempt to capture the culprit. However, it turns out that this person was just an accomplice and the real shooter is in the stands, and will shoot someone unless this person is set free. The police are forced to let him go, and he makes an impossible demand: 1 billion yen must be delivered before the end of the match. Conan realizes with this plan that the culprit had aimed to kill someone from the start, and he has to find out who the shooter who is still in the stadium is before he murders  someone before his eyes.\n",
