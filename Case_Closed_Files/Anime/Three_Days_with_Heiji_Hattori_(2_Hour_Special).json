    "Situation": "The next day, Heiji takes Conan with him to participate in a reality television deduction competition between high school detectives Heiji Hattori, Natsuki Koshimizu, Junya Tokitsu, and Saguru Hakuba. While there, they are being tested, but Tokitsu declares that he has solved the mystery and decides to test his theory out. He says that it would take around 30 minutes. While the rest wait, they have dinner. During that they discuss the purpose of the lavender in the house, and Natsuki mentions that it reminds her of a murder mystery that took place around a year ago.\n\n\n\nTokitsu is murdered and the detectives realize the television programming was a hoax.\n\n",
    "People": "- 41 years old\n- Actor pretending to be a Nichiuri TV producer\n- 58 years old\n- Caretaker\n- 18 years old\n- Detective of the South\n- Victim (beaten)\n- 18 years old\n- Detective of the North\n- Deceased (hanged)\n- Daughter of Lavender Mansion's owner\n- Deceased (fell)\n- Maid\n- Police detective from one year ago\n- Police detective from one year ago\n- Police inspector from one year ago\n- Ship captain\n- Resort Hotel receptionist\n",
    "Resolution": "The mistress of the Lavender Mansion was a mentally unstable socialite, who committed suicide by hanging a year ago. Natsuki's best friend Kana Mizuguchi worked as the lady's maid, with Renzo Kouya as the housekeeper; they were seen as possible suspects but were acquitted due to fact that there were no signs of foul play. Natsuki herself had visited the mansion and after investigating didn't find anything either.\nSome time later, however, the investigation was re-opened after Tokitsu came by the case on holiday and believed that it was a murder; some new tricks had been used in the house, after the suicide, leading Tokitsu and the police to believe that the lady was killed and the murderer escaped using the trick. Because of this, Kana became the prime suspect, and she begged Natsuki to protect her from the \"high school detective with a weird accent\"; she ended up cracking from the pressure and committed suicide by throwing herself into the sea before Natsuki could clear her unfairly tainted reputation.\nThe thief and the one behind the original trick was revealed to be Tsuchio who planned to rob the estate at later date, whom Natsuki located and hired to pose as a producer. Renzo had been the butler in the mansion, and knew that the mistress was a suicide threat, but didn't say anything out of misguided loyalty. He had just hoped that the police would stop suspecting the maid.\nSince Natsuki didn't know the detective's name, she went for the guy's gender and accent. The three other school detectives fit in this profile: Junya Tokitsu used an archaic male pronoun for himself (shousei), Heiji Hattori had a thick Osaka accent, and Saguru Hakuba's Japanese was odd since he lived abroad and got used to the foreign languages. She confronted Tokitsu first by tricking him into 'sharing' their conclusions and he began bragging about his skills as well as confirming that he was the one who had solved the Lavender Mansion murder case, causing Natsuki to beat him to death with the hammer and created the locked room.\nThe trick to the locked room was to remove the window frame and then replace it after leaving. The screws holding the frame in are removed and cut short. The frame is replaced after the murderer exits by simply gluing it back into place with the short screws slid into their corresponding holes so the window looks untampered with. Natsuki kept the screw heads on her person, which served as evidence of her crime. The reason she pretended to be afraid of the thunder was to come up with a excuse to cover her ears because the wind could have exposed her pierced ears.\nLastly, the reason she gathered all the people was to have all those she had a grudge against die together with her on the island, as she had bribed the ship captain to remain silent else he wouldn't receive the rest of the money. She apologizes to Conan for having him die along with her but Conan replies that help will surely come. Shortly later, Kazuha, Ran, and Kogoro arrive with the captain after they notice Heiji's hat as a sign that he boarded that ship, and the captain spills the beans after receiving a Judo throw from Kogoro six times. Natsuki who is somewhat relieved comments that if God would allow it then she would really like to do a real Detective Koushien with them.\n",
    "Case 2": "",
    "Trivia": "- Although Heiji appeared to have met Saguru in the movie The Private Eyes' Requiem, it was a movie, and therefore, non-canon. Moreover, Saguru didn't appear at all, since Kaitou Kid disguised as him. Thus, this is the first canon meeting between Heiji and Saguru.\n- Heiji claimed to have solved more than 1,000 cases, which is true, even though he had to include searching for cats as a child.\n- Saguru claimed that he solved about 500 cases, however that is only the cases he solved in Japan, and does not include the cases that he solved while studying abroad in England.\n- Since Heiji has a problem with Saguru being the high school detective of the east, Saguru decided to adopt the role of \"Guest from Abroad,\" and let Conan be the East's representative.\n"
