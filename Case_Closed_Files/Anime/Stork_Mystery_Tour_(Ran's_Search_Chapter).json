    "Situation": "Kogoro and Ran take the Detective Boys to an onsen in Kinosaki, Hyogo Prefecture, so Conan can heal his sprained ankle. While there, Ran runs into a little girl named Haruna Tabuse. Ran learns that Haruna is by herself and accompanies her around Kinosaki and remains unaware that a mysterious man is secretly stalking the pair. While Kogoro is interviewed by a man named Kouichi Yumoto, Conan notices that Ran is missing from the group and asks the Detective Boys if they have seen her. Mitsuhiko shows them a photo he took and which reveals Ran chasing after Haruna in the background and a the mysterious man. Unable to contact Ran through her phone, they discuss the probability that the man has captured Ran and the girl. Heiji coincidentally runs into the group revealing that he was hired by Haruna's father, Shuhei Tabuse, to search for her. Heiji takes Kogoro and Conan to meet Shuhei in an attempt to find a clue on Haruna's motive for running away from home. Shuhei reveals that Haruna was visiting a museum when the \"Rainbow Child\", an art sculpture created by his ex-wife, was stolen and Haruna was missing along with it. Elsewhere, the mysterious man uses a taser to incapacitate Ran and corners Haruna.\n\n\nHaruna is found unconscious and taken to the hospital. While her parents are arguing, Haruna sneaks out of the hospital after remembering that the man threatened to kill Ran if she did not deliver the \"Rainbow Child\" to him. Elsewhere, Conan and Heiji learn that Haruna was only able to read part of the letter causing her to read \"Kinosaki Hot Spring Station\" as \"Mountain Station\" and thus explains why she was searching for her mother at the mountain. After a long search, Conan and his companions are able to find Haruna at her aunt's home. There's a wonan named Michiko Sagara who is Kaho's friend. They capture the mysterious man.\n",
