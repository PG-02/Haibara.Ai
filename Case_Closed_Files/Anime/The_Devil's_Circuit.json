    "Situation": "A writer of Shizuoka invites Kogoro, Ran, and Conan to speak with the detective. During the evening, the woman asks Kogoro if he believes that her husband is cheating on her with her assistant. The next day, Kogoro finds the three people who died poisoned in their homes.\n\n\n\n",
    "People": "- Victim (poison)\n- 40 years old\n- Mystery writer\n- Victim (poison)\n- 29 years old\n- Chika's apprentice\n- Victim (poison)\n- 41 years old\n- Chika's husband\n- 25 years old\n- Shizuoka prefectural police department detective\n- 33 years old\n- Editor in charge\n",
    "Resolution": "Yuuichi's death was because he took the poisoned sleeping pills that Kouko Shimura intended for Chika to use, while Kouko died from the poison that Yuuichi Kaidou smeared on Chika’s glass. Chika had taken the glass to the kitchen to use it to drink some water or tea, because earlier her vase that was filled with water was knocked over. But she changed her mind at the last second leaving behind the poisoned glass, that same glass was found and eventually used to drink some water which ended in another death.\nWhile Yuuichi was setting up the poison, along with being shaken from committing a murder, Toda's call surprised him and he ended up bumping into the box of chocolate bars, causing them to fall on floor. He then hastily picked them up changing the positions of the two poisoned chocolate bars. Unaware of this, Chika threw away two chocolate bars thinking they were the ones that she herself poisoned and accidentally picked up the poisoned bar and ate it, resulting in her death.\nIn conclusion this was the sequence of events: first Kouko took the poisoned sleeping pills and placed them in Chika’s room, afterwards Yuuichi entered the room and rubbed poison on Chika glass cup. As he was leaving he had taken the poisoned sleeping pills that Kouko had left to calm himself down after committing the deed. He took the pills and died shortly there after, when Chika had been talking on the phone to her friend she had knocked over her vase filled with water and not wanting to drink from that she took the poisoned glass to the kitchen.\nHowever for some reason she changed her mind and decided not to drink any water and left her glass cup there, where it was found by Kouko who drank water from the same glass cup and died as well. Chika later on discovered that both her husband Yuuichi and Chika were dead, as they had inadvertently killed each other. She laughed gleefully believing she had won and had cheated death, which explains why Kogoro witnessed her laughing during the night of the \"murders\". She then went to her room and threw away two of the chocolate bars that she believed were the ones she poisoned and starting writing on her laptop, having found some inspiration during the whole ordeal.\n",
    "Trivia": "- The chocolate bar Chika was eating is named Chocolate Shock and is a parody of a popular brand in Japan called Big Thunder.\n- The painting in Kaidou villa is about the red leaf room from Solving Mysteries at the Red Leaf Palace. The place with Mount Fuji reappears in a painting in Suzuki Museum from Kaitou Kid and the Blush Mermaid, in the rental villa from The Tragedy of the Red Woman, and in the hotel reception from The Actress Blogger's Locked Room Case. The painting about a house reappears in Haido Hotel from Deduction Showdown at the Haunted Hotel and in \"Aska\" Restaurant from The Suspects Are a Passionate Couple.
