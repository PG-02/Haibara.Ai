    "Situation": "Conan and the Detective Boys are playing baseball at the construction site. When Mitsuhiko throws the ball, Genta hits it so hard that it went away to someone's yard. When they go there, they rang the door bell, and the mysterious man named Yoshikazu Watanuki appears to them. Conan asks if he could have the ball back from Watanuki's yard. Watanuki refuses and won't give the ball back. He then tells Conan and the Detective Boys to go away. The Detective Boys think that he's really mean. When Conan and the Detective Boys went to the Mouri detective agency, they see a man named Masao Kouda from Saku City, Nagano Prefecture, which is famous for the cosmos flowers. Conan asks him if he's meeting Kogoro. After that, they went inside, and Kouda asks Kogoro if he could find his missing younger sister, Sanae Kouda. He claims Watanuki has killed his sister and has buried her in his yard.\n\nKouda begs Kogoro to go with him to find his missing sister into his yard but unfortunately, Kogoro can't do that since it's illegally. Later, Kouda had stolen the jewels.\n\nMaking things worse is the intent he has to break into Watanuki's yard when Watanuki's gone to the hospital for his weekly Saturday treatment. Conan believes the story at first, but a call with Kouda's voice causes him to begin doubting everything he has heard.\nKouda hides stolen jewelry in Watanuki's yard to force the police department to dig it up, but unbeknown to him is that Mother Nature has caused an optical illusion to fool witness Shinichi Mochida. Can Conan prove Masao's innocence before a guilty man gets away permanently?\n",
