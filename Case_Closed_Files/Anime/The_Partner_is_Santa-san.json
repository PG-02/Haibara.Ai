    "Situation": "A young widow named Shigeko Ishikawa is being stalked by an unknown man, who has hung around her house and tried to push her down a public stair. Kogoro is walking around the streets and sees the last incident, and Shigeko hires him to find said stalker before they actually hurt her and her two-year-old child, Santa. Since Ran is training with the karate team, Conan is forced to watch over Santa.\nFor his very young age, however, Santa turns out to be very hyperactive and sociable, so Conan has difficulties keeping up with such a child: in few hours he has escaped from Conan's grasp several times, nearly reached the streets to see the cars, drawn on the walls and windows of the Mouri Detective Agency.\nShigeko is later kidnapped by the unknown man. Kogoro believes it's a stalker with a crush since Shigeko is a very beautiful woman, and talks to Chiba and Takagi about that. In the meantime, Conan and Santa go to Santa's home in order to search for clues. With the help of a neighbor, they find out about some birds, specially the white-eye bird.\n\n\nConan finds a feather of a White-eye bird and learns that Santa has been giving away figurines to people in the neighborhood, including some shaped as birds. Conan realizes what the culprit's motive is after learning about the endangered counterpart of the White-eye, the Black-eye. At the same time, it turns out that another neighbor of the Ishikawas seems to be in shady deals.\n",
    "People": "- 2 years old\n- Shigeko's child\n- Victim (kidnapped)\n- 30 years old\n- Santa's mother\n- Laundry clothes deliverer\n- 22 years old\n- Beika University school of veterinary medicine student\n- Yamanaka pet shop owner\n- Bird dealer\n- Loan shark\n- Sweet potatoes deliveryman in Beika 3-chome\n- Yamanaka's neighbor\n- Building manager\n- Victim (kidnapped)\n- Shigeko's client\n- Newscaster\n",
    "Resolution": "At the store, Conan confronts the culprit, Toshihiko Yamanaka. He reveals that Yamanaka was intending to sell a Black-eye living bird that he found, an extremely rare bird worth thousands of yens, in the black market. He kidnapped Santa's mother when he perceived the White-eye figurine to be a threat and believed that she and Santa were aware of the bird's existence.\nYamanaka says that his pet store was broke and he was so desperate that, when he found the black-eyed bird and captured it, he thought he'd be able to sell it well and clear his debts. He adds that he was sure Shigeko and Santa had realised what was going on, and Santa giving him the black-eye figurine was a warning from them. Conan clears the misunderstanding and explains Santa gave him the figurine in as a friendly gesture, since he's a fan of Santa as in Santa Claus and loves giving things to everyone. Yamanaka realizes he did a horrible thing and is driven to tears, so he releases Shigeko and prepares to turn himself in, saying that he will be a good man from then on and become worthy of little Santa's friendship.\nThe dealer Kurata, whom Yamanaka has organized a meeting with, doesn't share the idea. When Conan asks Yamanaka why did he push Shigeko down the stairs, he says it wasn't him. Then, Kurata attempts to steal the bird and takes little Santa as a hostage.\n\nConan's sleeping darts are stuck in his watch after having struggled with Yamanaka earlier so he cannot 'tranquilize' Kurata, who gets ready to escape despite poor Shigeko's tearful pleas and Yamanaka trying to interfere, but when the baby bites his kidnapper's arm and is released, Conan takes the chance to use his Power Shoes and kick a ball into him, knocking out and apprehending the dealer. Kurata is charged and jailed, and while Yamanaka won't get scot free for his kidnapping of Shigeko, his desperate circumstances will help him get a lighter punishment and the redemption he wants.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Shigeko Ishikawa's van is a Toyota HiAce Super Custom [H100].\n- Ran has her hair tied in a ponytail for her karate practice which is unusual.\n"
