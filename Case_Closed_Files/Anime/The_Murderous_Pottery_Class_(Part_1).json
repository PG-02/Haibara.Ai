    "Situation": "Ran, Sonoko, and Conan attend a pottery class. Sonoko wants to make pottery for Makoto, while Ran wants to make some for Shinichi. A man is strangled to death with a necktie by the teacher and found in a closet.\n\nConan knows who the culprit is, to the point of confronting the culprit when they're all alone, but still has no evidence. He tries to find evidence to prove it was him.\nIt appeared that Kikuyo had a 10 million yen debt and needed the insurance money to pay it. So, the police staff and Muneyuki started accusing her and as she was about to be taken to the police station, Sonoko was stunned by Conan's stun watch and stopped them.\n",
    "People": "- 62 years old\n- Potter\n- 29 years old\n- Muneyuki's assistant\n- Victim (strangled)\n- 31 years old\n- Office worker\n- Married into Muneyuki's family\n- Deceased (traffic accident)\n- Muneyuki's daughter\n- Motoo's ex-wife\n- Tokyo MPD Forensics officer\n- Medical examiner\n",
    "Resolution": "To do his alibi trick, Muneyuki Mino used Ran and Kikuyo. He put the apron on the inside of the folding door and taped it and shut the door while pushing the part that sticks out. When someone opens the door, the apron is pulled out. When someone closes it, the apron is forced out and sticks out of the door. He purposely dropped the dish in front of the locker, made Ran clean up the pieces in order to confirm there's nothing sticking out, made Kikuyo get the first aid kit, and open the door to have the trick activated. The corpse was hidden inside the closet all the time.\nFirst, he tied a necktie around the head of the corpse, put the it through the left hanger-bar, hang the corpse so it tilts backwards, pull the necktie up through above the slot on the left door, and the necktie pin serves as a stopper. This way when the left door is open, the corpse is invisible but when both doors are open at once, the necktie pin would fall off and the corpse falls forward. He get rid of evidence when he approach the corpse. The evidence is the nail marks left on the necktie pin. He admitted the crime and was soon arrested.\nIt turned out that during Christmas, while Muneyuki was in the room of his late daughter, he found the crumpled box of the necktie his daughter was intending to give to Motoo, her husband. And when he went to the airport, wanting to give the tie to Motoo, instead of seeing a grieving man, he saw a cheerful man together with Kikuyo. This made him realize that his daughter committed suicide after learning of their relationship, meaning Motoo had had been cheating on her.\n",
    "Trivia": "- Ran brought up about when Sonoko was wanting to purchase a hand-made knit sweater for Makoto, which was in the Megure's Sealed Secret case.\n",
