    "Description": "Conan uses a tranquilizer dart in the watch to put people (usuallyKogoro Mouri) to sleep. It was created with the intention of putting attackers to sleep. Conan found out a second use for it, to knock out others, he needs to take credit for solving the cases, since people hardly would listen to a child and since he can't use his real identity in public. Conan must be very accurate as he can only carry one dart in the watch at a time. Around the time Agasa gave the Detective Boys theWristwatch Flashlightshe also gave a flashlight function to the Tranquillizer Watch. In the 17th moviePrivate Eye in the Distant SeaAgasa added satellite-phone function and flash drive to the Tranquillizer Watch.\n",
