    "Description": "Agasa created this super fast skateboard for Conan to help him chase down criminals. Unfortunately, without solar power the skateboard's engine will not work. Although it is commonly shown in the anime and movies, it has only appeared twice in the manga: itsintroductory casewhere Conan uses it to keep up with the car where Ayumi had been accidentally locked in a trunk, and briefly when Conan used it to rendezvous with Agasa and Haibara at a restaurant after they warned him abouttwo suspicious people.\nThe skateboard's engine receives an upgrade inThe Last Wizard of the Centuryenabling Conan to use stored solar energy in order to use the skateboard at nighttime. Once again, it is upgraded inQuarter of Silence, allowing the Skateboard to be converted into a Turbo Engine Snowboard. With its upgrades, the skateboard can outspeed a car.\nA new red-colored version was introduced inLupin III vs. Detective Conan: The Moviethat could travel on water and had retractable wheels. The skateboard was destroyed however byGoemon Ishikawaslashing it in two with his Zantetsuken. Haibara later tells Conan that the original blue skateboard suits him better anyway.\n",
    "In the media": "The Turbo Engine Skateboard is one of the most represented gadget on pictures, merchandise or advertisements promotingDetective Conan, as seen on movie posters, DVD covers, wallpapers and more, even though it has appeared in fillers way more than in the manga.\n",
