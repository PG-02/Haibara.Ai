    "Description": "By turning the dial on the back Conan is able to imitate all kinds of voices that he hears. When Conan isn't wearing the bowtie, he'll usually store it away in a pocket until he needs it. This gadget is usually used together with theStun-Gun Wristwatch, prior to receiving it, Conan was shown to knock Kogoro unconscious by kicking an ashtray, though there are some cases he solves as Kogoro such asepisode 95where Kogoro is knocked out by accident, forcing Conan to use his bow tie.\nVoice changing bow tie has a megaphone mode as shown in File 998.\nThere is a white version of the bow tie as shown only in episode 505-506, and 520.\n",
    "Technical details": "The theory behind the Voice-Changing Bowtie is that it works on a frequency modifier system based on patterns from the voice it is to emulate. Voice changers are real technology.\nIn the real world the Voice-Changing Bowtie has many flaws, such as the frequency response for the size of the speakers in the bowtie wouldn't be able to reproduce frequency of a voice realistically. The frequency modifier, in most cases, wouldn't be able reproduce the subtle but also distinguishable variations of another persons voice. In order to even change the sound in the first place they will need components such as a mic, speaker, processor and powerful batteries to keep it all running. Last but not least the Voice-Changing Bowtie needs to have Conan voice inverted to cancel out his voice completely, otherwise it would be present and noticeable. As this is a fictional drama with many factual references take it with a grain of salt that this is subject to a persons imagination, but these types of technology can and will be possible in the near future if they utilise extremely thin and small magnetic speakers which can accurately reproduce the frequencies accordingly, and the                   other components reduce drastically in size.\n",
    "Usage": "Under Construction\nIn most cases, Conan will use the bowtie to simulate Kogoro's voice; and less frequently Sonoko's to solve a case, and in other cases he's had Agasa lip sync or phoned in as Shinichi Kudo to solve the case, and a handful of times has solved cases as Misao Yamamura. In some unique situations, Conan used the bowtie to take other people's voices, such as Heiji Hattori in theHolmes Freak Murderor Eri Kisaki inMagician of the Silver Sky. The voice-changing function on the bowtie works by turning the dial behind the left bow to a different preset number. In the animeEpisode 23, Conan mentioned in his inner speech that Kogoro Mouri's voice is stored in preset number 59.\n",
