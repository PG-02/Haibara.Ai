    "Description": "According to Agasa, these shoes use electricity and magnetic fields to stimulate Conan's feet muscles allowing him to kick objects with tremendous power.\nPrior to receiving theAnywhere Ball Dispensing Belt, Conan needed to find objects nearby an area in order to kick them at criminals. Some times he was lucky enough to come across a soccer ball, but most times he'd end up kicking soup cans and most anything imaginable. This was proven to be a problem once when Conan couldn't find anything to kick at a criminal but a head of lettuce which exploded upon him kicking it.[2]\n",
