    "Description": "These glasses use radar, enabling Conan to track down criminals and locate his transmitters within a 20km radius. The glasses can also be used to track down the location of theDetective Boys badges.\nTo activate the radar on the glasses, Conan presses a small button on the left-hand side. Pressing this button extends an antenna and turns the main screen on, displayed on the left lens with North, South, East, and West compass directions at the edges. Locations of transmitters (or the Detective Boys badges) appear as dots on the screen.\nTo go along with the glasses, Agasa gave Conan small sticker-like transmitters that resemble the yellow button on Conan's jacket, allowing Conan to hide the transmitter in plain sight and still have it handy when he needs it. However, the glasses needs to be charged, which is why Agasa made another pair of glasses.\nRecently, Agasa has also added anight-vision & zoom featurefor the glasses as well.[2]\n",
    "Unique uses": "- InReunion with the Black OrganizationConan loansHaibarathe Criminal Tracking Glasses to disguise her face and help put her mind at ease.\n- DuringThe Desperate Revival, Conan uses the sticker transmitters on rocks in the cave he and the Detective Boys wander into and then leaves the Criminal Tracking Glasses on the ground. When Haibara discovers them later and widens the radar's view she discovers that the transmitters on the rocks form the number \"110\", the emergency telephone number for the police in Japan.\n"
