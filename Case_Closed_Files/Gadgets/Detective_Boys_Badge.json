    "Description": "Agasa created these badges for Conan and the rest of the Detective Boys group to use in order to communicate with each other from a distance, much like a set of walkie-talkies. The badges also give out a signal that can be located using theCriminal Tracking Glasses. InMovie 18, it has been modified so that the Detective Boys can communicate at a distance. Also when changing the settings and press the buttons to talk they lit up which they had LED lamps. One can even choose the colour and which badges to light up. Through the badges now produce a mosquito noise.\n",
