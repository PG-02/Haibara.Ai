    "Description": "A cellphone that can be worn on the ear and easily transported. The cellphone also works as a wireless speaker for the Voice-Changing Bowtie. Other notable users of the invention include Ran and Minami Takayama of the band TWO-MIX.\n",
    "Possibly a discontinued Gadget": "This invention has not been used much as of late due to the evolution of cellphone technology throughout the series 15+ year run. Conan is seen using a smartphone instead, this is because smartphones are getting cheaper and it isn't unusual to see young children owning and using one in this current society.\n"
