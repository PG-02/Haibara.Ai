    "Story summary": "The story follows the adventures of Shinichi Kudo (also known as Jimmy Kudo in Case Closed), a young detective prodigy who was inadvertently shrunk into a child's body due to a poison he was force-fed by members of a criminal syndicate. Neighbor and family friend Professor Agasa strongly suggested Shinichi hide his identity to prevent them from killing him and the people he cares about, so Shinichi takes the name Conan Edogawa. He goes to live with his childhood friend Ran Mouri and her father, Kogoro, and tries to use Kogoro's detective agency as a way to find the people who shrank him—without letting Ran figure out who he really is.\n",
    "Internal rules": "The world of Detective Conan has a set of internal rules that might catch unfamiliar readers of the manga and spectators of the anime off guard, such as the lack of information sharing and the regular illogical and irrational behavior exhibited by many characters. The universe is mostly consistent within its rules, with a few exceptions. The passing of time is difficult to judge, due to a literary device known as a floating timeline, which enables the compression of 20+ years worth of events and technological upgrades into less than one year.\n",
    "Case Closed": "\nDetective Conan is known as \"Case Closed\" in North America. The name \"Case Closed\" results from concerns of copyright conflict of the name Detective Conan.[1] Incidentally, \"Case Closed\" is later used as the catchphrase for Masumi Sera (whether it's intended as a reference or coincidental is unspecified).\n",

    "Critical reception": "The series has been well received in Japan, with the anime adaptation ranking in the top twenty in Animage's polls between 1996 until 2000, where it dropped below the top twenty. In the Japanese TV anime ranking, Detective Conan often ranked the top six. It has even been used as a mascot to promote citizens to follow the law. The English adaptation has not been as equally popular as in Japan, and has been criticized for the character name changes.\nThe manga is a huge success and it is continued to be published. It won the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award for the shōnen category in 2000. Some of its volumes appear on the lists of best-selling manga.\nThe series is successful in Asia and Europe, where some countries translated most of the episodes and volumes. Due to the high popularity DC is re-broadcasting in many countries after the original premieres.\nAlthough popular in many other countries, Case Closed was not as successful in the US, most likely due to poor advertising, name changes, and script changes around Japanese people and culture.\nDue to this, FUNimation's dubbed version of \"Case Closed\" was cancelled at only 130 episodes.\nAlthough, many fans wanted the anime version of Detective Conan to be successful in North America, excluding the renamed character names, it did not do well and still failed and got several negative reviews, and therefore in 2018, FUNimation Entertainment lost the rights to \"Case Closed\", along with \"KenIchi: The Mightiest Disciple\".\nHowever, the manga is still released by VIZ Media.\n",
    "Demographic": "Even though Detective Conan is a Shōnen, its audience is composed of a substantial proportion of female viewers and readers. The series also seems to attract all ages.\n",
    "Appearances in other media": "Besides his anime and manga appearances, Conan is the protagonist for all the movies and the video games based on the Case Closed series. Several anime and games have parodied, lampooned or otherwise mentioned him or the series. Some of them include: Yakitate!! Japan,[28] Black Cat,[29] Inuyasha,[30] Hayate the Combat Butler,[31] Proposal Daisakusen,[32] Sonic X,[33] Kenichi the Mightiest Disciple[34], Angelic Layer[35], and Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney[36] In case of Inuyasha, Detective Conan features Conan reading Inuyasha manga first in episode 200 (aired July 24, 2000). Later, Shinichi and Ran made their cameo appearance in Inuyasha episode 128 (aired October 13, 2003).\nConan has also been used as a character to promote people to follow the law in Japan, due to the popularity of the series.\n"
